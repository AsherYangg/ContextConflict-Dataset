        "source_1": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump to implement his ban ontransgender peopleserving inthe military.\n\nThe justices granted an emergency request from the Trump administration to lift a nationwide injunction blocking the policy while litigation continues.\n\nThe court'sbrief ordernoted that the three liberal justices dissented.\n\n\"No more trans @ DoD,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethsaidon X. In a separateDefense Department postearlier Tuesday, before the decision was issued, Hegseth said in a video: \"No more dudes in dresses. We are done with that s---.\"\n\nJust over 4,000 transgender peoplecurrently servein the military, according to Defense Department data, though some activists put the figure much higher. There are around 2.1 million active service members in total.\n\nAmong those affected with be the seven individual transgender service members, led by lead plaintiff Emily Shilling, a Navy commander, who had sued to block it.\n\n\"Transgender service members have served this nation with courage, skill, and selflessness for years,\" Shilling said in a statement Tuesday. \"We’ve flown combat missions, led sailors, commanded troops, and stood watch. We are not a theory. We are not a policy debate. We are real people, doing real jobs, in defense of a nation we still believe in, even when it struggles to believe in us.\"\n\n\"I know this decision will cause fear and doubt in the ranks. To those feeling shaken, I say this: stand tall. You are not alone. You are part of a community that will fight for you, stand beside you, and never stop pushing forward,\" she added.\n\nLambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, two groups representing the plaintiffs, said in a joint statement that the Supreme Court decision was a \"devastating blow\" to transgender service members.\n\nThe policy “has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,” they added.\n\nIn a separate case, a judge in Washington, D.C., also blocked the policy nationwide, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put that ruling on hold temporarily while it heard arguments on whether to block it more permanently.The court has yet to rule.\n\nThe policy, announced in February, is much more comprehensive ban than a similar proposal implemented during the first Trump term. It \"generally disqualifies from military service individuals who have gender dysphoria or have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in court papers.\n\nIn asking the Supreme Court to intervene, Sauer said that judges are required to show \"substantial deference\" to the Defense Department's judgment on military issues.\n\nIn implementing the policy, the government relied on a Pentagon report from the first Trump term that said people with gender dysphoria are a threat to \"military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nThe challengers argued in court that the ban violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which requires that laws apply equally to everybody, as well as other constitutional provisions.\n\nTransgender service members have shown in recent years that they can serve just as well as anyone else, their lawyers said in court papers. Then-President Joe Biden had rolled back Trump's earlier restrictions.\n\n\"An unprecedented degree of animus towards transgender people animates and permeates the ban: it is based on the shocking proposition that transgender people do not exist,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Washington state blocked the policy March 27, saying “it is not an especially close question.” The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put the ruling on hold, prompting the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.",
        "source_2": "The US Supreme Court temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his ban on transgender people  serving in the military while legal challenges to the policy move forward.\n\nShortly after taking office in January, Trump signed a pair of executive orders that enabled the Pentagon to implement the ban.\n\nBut a lower federal court blocked the policy in March, ruling that the administration had failed to provide evidence that transgender troops posed a threat to military effectiveness.\n\nIn an emergency application to the court, the Trump administration argued that the lower court should show deference to the military's  judgement in matters of national defence.\n\nThe court's three liberal justices objected to the stay, which arrived via an unsigned order on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's executive order declared that identifying as transgender \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle\" and would hamper military preparedness.\n\nIn February, the Department of Defense announced it would begin discharging currently serving transgender personnel.\n\nSeven servicemembers, including Commander Emily Schilling, a Navy fighter pilot, swiftly challenged the ban, along with a transgender individual seeking to enlist.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the ban \"undermines military readiness, endangers our safety, and violates the United States Constitution\".\"\n\n\"Today's Supreme Court ruling is a devastating blow to transgender servicemembers who have demonstrated their capabilities and commitment to our nation's defense,\" Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which are representing the plaintiffs, said in a joint statement.\n\n\"By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the Court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,\" it said.\n\nIn March, a federal judge in Washington state ordered a nationwide halt on the administration's ban, saying the government failed to show it would enhance \"unit cohesion, good order or discipline\".\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not block the lower court's ruling, keeping the injunction in place.\n\nWith the Supreme Court order, that pause will lift while the servicemembers' lawsuit makes its way through lower courts.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the order \"another massive victory in the Supreme Court\".\n\nEarly in his second term, Trump took a series of actions that have significantly impacted transgender individuals, whose gender identity does not correspond to the sex assigned to them at birth.\n\nHe signed an executive order declaring the US would onlyrecognise two sexes - male and female.\n\nThe order has had far reaching implications for transgender Americans, especially those seeking to obtain official documentation.\n\nThe State Department announced in February that itwould no longer allow applicants to choose \"X\" for their gender on their US passport, but instead must choose \"male\" or \"female\" based on their sex assigned at birth.\n\nThe passport policy is the subject of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a group of transgender and nonbinary individuals. In mid-April, a federal judge issued an injunction on the passport policy while the case proceeds.\n\nThe administration has also pushed for policies to restrict certain kinds of healthcare for minors who identify as transgender, and to prevent transgender women from playing on women's sports teams.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.\n\nTariffs, oversupply and teetotaling Gen-Zs have all contributed to the downfall of one of America's most iconic liquors.\n\nJen Pawol donated her hat to a baseball museum after her history-making game on Saturday.",

President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say.\n\nTheSupreme Courton Tuesday sided with the Trump administration in lifting a lower court order that paused the Pentagon's transgender military ban from taking effect – allowing Trump's order and related policies to proceed, at least.\n\nThe high court ruling is a near-term victory for the White House, even as it did not address the underlying merits of the case or PresidentDonald Trump'sJan. 27 executive order banning transgender service members from the U.S. military.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the administration's appeal and kept the lower court injunction in place.\n\nAt issue in the suit, Shilling v. United States, is Trump's executive order banning transgender military members.\n\nHEGSETH SAYS HE'S SIGNING MEMO ON COMBAT ARMS STANDARDS FOR MEN AND WOMEN\n\nAt issue in the suit, Shilling v. United States, is President Donald Trump's January executive order banning transgender military members.(Getty Images)\n\nTheexecutive orderwould require the Defense Department to update its guidance regarding \"trans-identifying medical standards for military service\" and to \"rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that further stalling the policy could pose a threat to U.S. military readines – concerns it outlined to Supreme Court in a filing late last month.\n\n\"Absent a stay, the district court’s universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this Court – a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the Nation’s interests,\" U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court, urging justices to grant the stay.\n\nTrump officials have argued that the transgender military policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\"\n\nThe case was immediately challenged in federal court. Seven transgender military members brought suit against the administration in Seattle-basedfederal court,and in Washington, D.C., where U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes grilled lawyers for the Trump administration in a dizzying line of questioning that invokedshelters, Jesus, and Miss Pac-Man, among other things, before asking the government to push its planned implementation deadline. That decision was later overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nTRUMP'S TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN DEALT LEGAL BLOW AFTER APPEALS COURT RULING\n\nThe January executive order required the Department of Defense to update its guidance regarding \"trans-identifying medical standards for military service\" and to \"rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\"(Omar Marques/Getty Images)\n\nIn the Seattle case, plaintiffs argued that the executive order \"turns away\" transgender military members \"and kicks them out – for no legitimate reason.\"\n\n\"Rather, it baselessly declares all transgender people unfit to serve, insults and demeans them, and cruelly describes every one of them as incapable of ‘an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,’ based solely because they are transgender,\" it continued.\n\nU.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle issued a preliminary injunction in March that blocked the administration from identifying and removing transgender service members as the suit worked its way through the lower courts.\n\nIn his opinion granting the injunction, Settle characterized the ban as a \"blanket prohibition on transgender service.\" Settle found the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their equal protection, First Amendment, and procedural due process claims, among others.\n\n\"The government’s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" Settle wrote.\n\nSettle wrote in his order that the injunction was to \"maintain the status quo ofmilitary policyregarding both active-duty and prospective transgender service\" that were in place prior to Trump's Jan. 27 executive order.\n\nThe administration quickly appealed the order to the 9th Circuit, requesting the appellate court stay Settle's order.\n\nHEGSETH SUGGESTS JUDGE REPORT TO MILITARY BASES AFTER RULING THAT PENTAGON MUST ALLOW TRANSGENDER TROOPS\n\nThe administration argued in court filings that the policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\"\n\nA three-judge panel – composed of Judges Atsushi Wallace Tashima, a Clinton-appointee, John B. Owens, an Obama-appointee, and Roopali H. Desai, a Biden-appointee – denied the administration's request for a stay on March 31, which was overturned by the Supreme Court ruling Tuesday.\n\nTransgender plaintiffs also notably sued in D.C. federal court, where U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes also initially blocked the ban from going into effect.(Getty/Reuters)\n\n\"The Department of Justice has vigorously defended President Trump’s executive actions, including the Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness Executive Order, and will continue to do so,\" aJustice Departmentofficial told Fox News Digital at the time.\n\nShilling v. United States is just one of several suits challenging the Trump administration's military ban. It comes as Trump has used his early days in office to undo major Biden-era policies, including their efforts to promote a diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, agenda.\n\nHaley Chi-Sing is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.
