        "source_1": "Officials in North Carolina and Florida are racing against the clock to put in new voting procedures aimed at making it easier to cast ballots after thedevastating stormsthat tore through the states.\n\nWhy it matters:The changes — which include modifying early voting days and increased flexibility with some voting locations — reflect the growing concerns about the storms' impacts on the Nov. 5 election.\n\nUnlike the 2020 election,when Republicans opposed pandemic-related changes such as expanded mail-in voting, both parties are encouraging new rules to help people vote.\n\nState of play:North Carolina's elections board this week unanimously approved emergency measures for the 13 western counties hit hardest by Helene.\n\nThe changes could helpmany North Carolinians vote, but voting isn't likely to be top of mind for those with profound losses.\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed an executive order after Helene that authorized election changes in the hardest-hit counties.\n\nBut some voting rights groupsare urging DeSantis to do more, such asre-opening voter registration.\n\nBetween the lines:Vice President Harris'North Carolina team says it's spent more than $30,000 on voter relief efforts in the state. It's also working in 28 local offices to support voters across the state.\n\nWhat they're saying:\"We are working closely with our legal and voter-protection teams and the N.C. Democratic Party to ensure that every eligible voter is able to safely make their voices heard,\" Dory MacMillan, spokesperson for Harris' North Carolina team, said in a statement.\n\nTrump, who has amplified false claimsaboutfederal assistanceto those impacted byHelene, said during a town hall this week that \"we're trying to make it convenient for them to [vote], but they just lost their house.\"\n\nReality check:Trump's sudden embrace of expanded access to voting is a reversal not just from his efforts in 2020, but also from his rhetoric during this campaign cycle, when he's generally backedrestrictions to voting.\n\nGo deeper:How N.C. will administer an election in Helene's wake\n\nAxios' Lucille Sherman contributed reporting from Raleigh, N.C.",

North Carolina’s election board imposed a number ofemergency measuresto make it easier for voters in affected counties to cast a ballot, such as making it easier to change early polling sites and hours, allowing voters to vote at board of elections offices if they can’t get to their precinct and allowing voters to request absentee ballots in person through Nov. 4. Lawmakers in the state thenpasseda $273 million relief package on Wednesday that further expands those measures to even more counties. Tennesseemovedsome polling places and election office locations amid damage from Helene, and DeSantis passed anexecutive orderfor Florida counties affected by Helene that made rules around voting procedures—like moving polling places or requesting a ballot be sent to a different address—more flexible. (The governor has not yet passed any measures regarding areas affected by Hurricane Milton.) In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergersaidafter Helene all the “physical infrastructure” needed to operate the state’s election would be “fully operational” by the time early voting starts, and while the state launched awebpagefor any precinct changes as a result of the hurricane, none have yet been announced.\n\nIf or how the hurricanes will impact the November election. While election administratorsare workingto ensure the disasters do not impact access to voting, Election Day will come as voters across the South are focused on rebuilding their homes or still displaced by the storms. It remains to be seen what impact the ongoing fallout could have on voter turnout as a result. A majority of voters in counties now suffering damage from Hurricane Helene supported former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, NPRreports, which includes voters in the key battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina—though there are exceptions, with left-leaning areas like Asheville, North Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, also impacted by the storm. Trump has been trying topoliticizethe hurricanes and spreadfalsehoodsabout Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration’s response, falselyclaimingFEMA is running out of money because the administration gave money to migrants instead. (The funds being used for disaster relief are completely separate from those being used to support migrant communities.) It’s still unclear what kind of impact those lies could have, as other figures on the right have spread misinformation about the hurricane, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., falselyclaiming“they” can control the weather.\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall in late September and brought widespread devastation throughout the South, affecting states including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee and leading to more than 200fatalities. Hurricane Miltonmade landfallin Florida as a Category 3 storm Wednesday, only weeks later, making landfall in Sarasota before traveling through central Florida and going out to sea from the state’s east coast. The storm also spurred tornadoes throughout Florida that have so far led to four fatalities. Damage is still being assessed from the latest hurricane and three million homes and businesses are still without power as of Thursday morning, though DeSantissaid Thursdaythe state avoided the “worst case scenario” in terms of damage from the storm.",
        "source_3": "Published:23:28 BST, 9 October 2024|Updated:12:22 BST, 10 October 2024\n\nNearly every modern US presidential election cycle has been upended by anunforeseen 'surprise'of one sort or another.\n\nIn July 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern was shocked to learn, after his party's summer convention, that his running mate Thomas Eagleton had secretly received electroshock therapy to treat bouts ofdepression.\n\nThat was enough to discredit Eagleton with the grand poohbahs of theDemocratic Partyand help doom McGovern's campaign.\n\nEight years later, I was working as a strategist for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, when my bosses coined the phrase 'October Surprise'.\n\nThey were concerned that our opponent, President Jimmy Carter, would transform the race by negotiating a last-minute deal with armed Iranian revolutionaries to release the 53 American hostages who had been held in Tehran for over a year.\n\nOf course, everyone wanted the hostages released no matter what the circumstances, but it was our job to anticipate the potential political fallout of such an event.\n\nIt's early October, less than four weeks until the election and there's another October Surprise is in the making.\n\nThis one is not man-made. It is not the result of an unforced error by a candidate behaving badly.\n\nIt is an act of God bearing down on the critical swing state ofFlorida.\n\nIt's early October, less than four weeks until the election and there's another October Surprise is in the making.\n\nFirst and foremost, I pray that every single person impacted by Hurricane Milton emerges from this storm safely and free from property loss.\n\nI also recognize that this, tragically, is an unlikely outcome. So, I offer this analysis as a political strategist and pollster, fully aware that many things in life are more important than an election.\n\nBut is it my job to consider what may happen – and I've concluded that Milton may be a game-changer come November 5.\n\nIn the 2020 election, Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden in Florida by over 370,000 votes, which equates to barely 3 percentage points.\n\nThat's a decent margin in the Sunshine State, but not a dominant one.\n\nTrump won in 2020, in part, by running up the Republican tally in ruby-red GOP counties like Pasco, Marion and Sarasota, near Tampa.\n\nBig turnouts in those Republican strongholds offset Democratic wins in blue regions of the state, like Miami-Dade County in Florida's southeast.\n\nBut now, Hurricane Milton is blowing its way right into the heart of Florida – and places like Pasco and Sarasota lie directly in its path.\n\n(Above) Hundreds take shelter at Virgil Mills Elementary School ahead of Hurricane Milton, in Palmetto, Florida\n\n(Above) Robert Haight looks around his destroyed house after it was hit by a reported tornado in Fort Myers, Florida, on October 9, 2024\n\nOf all the 15 Florida counties under mandatory state evacuation orders, 14 are dominantly, if not overwhelmingly, Republican.\n\nThe total number of registered Republican voters in those 15 counties is slightly over two million, while the number of registered Democrats in those same counties is about 1.2 million.\n\nApproximately 800,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in the state of Florida are being told to get out of their homes.\n\nIn the 2020 election, there was a huge 77 percent turnout rate in Florida – meaning nearly one out of every eight eligible voters cast a ballot.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans Floridians in these Milton-impacted areas will be under duress, hopefully not in life-threatening jeopardy, but certainly disadvantaged or inconvenienced to the point that they may not vote.\n\nFor argument's sake, consider what happens if dislocation, financial loss, physical harm or emotional stress depress Florida's turnout rate to 40 percent.\n\nThat's a realistic assumption. Who would bother voting if their house had been blown off its foundations or their truck has been destroyed - or worse?\n\nAt that suppressed 40 percent rate, only 320,000 Republicans in these impacted counties would show up on election day or mail-in their ballot.\n\nThat's a projected loss of 280,000 Republican votes.\n\nIn other words, this election may have just gotten much, much closer.\n\nAnd now add to this calculations the additional motivating factors that are driving Florida Democrats to the polls.\n\nThere is a measure on the ballot that would establish a right to abortion in the Florida Constitution – and another would legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nMany of my fellow Republican strategists underestimated the electoral impact of abortion measures on the ballot in the 2020 midterms – as they predicted a 'Red Wave' for the GOP across the country.\n\nI thought otherwise and said so on national television at the time.\n\nThere is reason for Donald Trump's campaign to be concerned.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis is an honorable guy, and he understands his primary duty is to protect people and property in his state.\n\nBut I'm hoping the governor's office, amongst its many initiatives in the coming days, also thinks of how voters may be disenfranchised by this storm.\n\nPerhaps the Governor can loosen absentee voting rules, or, better yet, attach an absentee ballot — Democrat and Republican — to every aid packet that his Office of Emergency Management distributes.\n\nBy doing so, the Governor will fulfill his obligations to protect life as well as democracy.\n\nNo race should be won because Americans couldn't vote.\n\nCraig Keshishian was a project director on President Reagan's polling team and later, served in Reagan's Presidential Speechwriting and Research Office\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
