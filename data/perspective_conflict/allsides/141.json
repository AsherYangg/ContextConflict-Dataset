    "question": "How should the Senate weigh the CBO’s projection that Trump’s bill would add $2.4 trillion to the debt and increase the uninsured by 10.9 million against supporters’ claims that tax cuts and spending changes will spur growth and improve the fiscal outlook as it considers revisions?",

        "source_1": "WASHINGTON — Thesweeping Republican billfor President Donald Trump's domestic agenda is projected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, according to anew estimatefrom the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe figure is slightly higher than an earlier version of the bill, which the CBO projected to add $2.3 trillion in new debt.\n\nThe budget office also estimated that the package would increase the number of people without health insurance by 10.9 million by 2034 because of spending cuts and new eligibility rules under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe coverage losses include 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status\" who the CBO projects would fail to meet that new requirement.\n\nThe long-awaited new score factors in a series oflast-minute revisionsGOP leaders made to placate holdouts before the House passed the legislation last month. The changes include a higher state and local tax deduction and a provision that would trigger the Medicaid work requirements sooner than the original legislation would have.\n\nOverall, the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation found that over a 10-year period, the legislation would decrease revenues by $3.7 trillion, while cutting net spending by $1.3 trillion — for a total of $2.4 trillion in new red ink.\n\nThe legislation is now in the hands of the Senate, where top Republicans want to make changes and pass a revised version by July 4. It is unclear what changes they will make or how those revisions would affect the deficit.\n\nThe score contradicts claims by the White House and GOP leaders that the bill won't worsen the national debt. They have highlighted the spending while downplaying the tax cuts and extensions that affect the long-term budget outlook.\n\nAnd it emboldens new criticism by Trump's billionaire former adviser Elon Musk, whoexcoriated the billTuesday as a \"disgusting abomination,\" citing the increase in the debt.\n\nWhite House budget director Russell Vought pushed back on the CBO score, highlighting the spending cuts while downplaying the new deficits it would create. He argued that an extension of the Trump tax cuts shouldn't be scored as increasing the deficit, calling it a \"realistic\" baseline to assume they continue at no cost.\n\n\"It includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings, the most in history. If you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture,\" Voughtwrote on X.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said the CBO isn't giving enough credit to the economic benefits of the tax cuts.\n\nFor their part, Democrats invoked the CBO score to tear into the bill.\n\n\"Even after the biggest cuts to health care and food assistance in U.S. history, the Republican bill for billionaires would still add a historic amount to our debt — all to give the ultra-rich more tax breaks,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the ranking member on the House Budget Committee, said in a statement. \"Republicans cry crocodile tears over the debt when Democrats are in charge — but explode it when they’re in power.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresidentDonald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill will add $2.4 trillion to the U.S. federal debt pile, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nThis figure is the CBO's estimated net effect of the House bill on the deficit for 2025 to 2034, according to an analysis published Wednesday. It also said the bill cuts taxes by $3.75 trillion.\n\nThe sprawling bill, which squeaked through the House, is headed to theSenate, where a number ofRepublicansare sounding the alarm over its impact on federal debt.\n\nIt is the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda, and includes wide-ranging tax cuts, and extra money for the military and border security.\n\nSen.Rand Paul, a libertarianRepublicanfrom Kentucky, said he and four others in the Senate GOP are opposed to the bill in its current formbecause it grows the debt pile.\n\n\"I want to see the tax cuts made permanent, but I also want to see the $5 trillion in new debt removed from the bill,\" Paul posted to X, formerlyTwitter.\n\nPaul said he can support the bill if an increase to the debt ceiling—a limit on the amount the federal government can borrow—is removed.\n\nTrump and his allies argue that the CBO's calculations do not properly reflect the economic impact of the tax cuts, which they say will fuel economic growth that ultimately shrinks the deficit rather than expands it.\n\nThey say the bill actually cuts federal spending by around $1.6 trillion.\n\n\"Of course, honestly accounted, extending current tax rates has zero deficit impact which is why the bill, because of its spending cuts, reduces the deficit,\" saidStephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, in a post on X.\n\nElon Musk, former White House adviser on federal spending cuts, on X: \"Interest payments already consume 25% of all government revenue. If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else! No social security, no medical, no defense … nothing.\"\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-TX) toldFox Newsat the end of May:\"We will get it done. Now, it's going to be bumpy, it's going to be messy. But we will get it done because it is the main vehicle for us to deliver on the mandate from the voters.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)said in a statement: \"The Congressional Budget Office just confirmed that Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill is, inElon Musk's words, a 'disgusting abomination.' This independent analysis blows a hole through Congressional Republicans' lies—this bill will rip health care away from millions of people and still jack up the debt to fund trillions in tax breaks for billionaires and billionaire corporations.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on X:\"For years, Republicans screamed about fiscal responsibility. Now? Republicans are backing a bill that could add over $50 TRILLION to the national debt over 30 years.\"\n\nThe bill will now be debated and refined in the Senate, as it was in the House, with as many as five Republicans unhappy with the legislation in its current form.\n\nUpdate, 6/4/25, 1:15 p.m. ET: A comment by Elizabeth Warren was added, and additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.

        "source_3": "Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune(R-SD) pushed back against criticisms of PresidentDonald Trump‘s ‘big, beautiful bill,’ which Trump allyElon Muskdeemeda “disgusting abomination.”\n\nThune suggested that analyses by people he dubbed “Washington, D.C. scorekeepers” on the president’s tax bill were previously incorrect about other pieces of legislation, using the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the $1.5 trillion it generated as an example. Beyond what he said is the “track record” of these forecasts being incorrect, Thune also predicted that reduced taxes would lead to increased incentive to invest, creating “better-paying jobs.”\n\n“So there’s just a lot of analysis around this bill that isn’t accurately reflecting what will happen when all these policies are put into place,” Thune said on Fox News’sAmerica’s Newsroom. “And by the way, it will be the biggest spending reduction in history. There’s just no question about that. It’s going to have huge savings in it, and we’re hoping to enhance that here in the Senate.”\n\nThune argued that Trump’s bill addresses many of the party’s priorities, ranging from modernizing the military to securing the southern border and extending tax cuts, saying that a $4.5 trillion increase in taxes cannot happen before the end of this year.\n\nSen.Rand Paul(R-KY) has also voiced criticism of Trump’s bill,expressing opposition to the bill raising the debt ceiling. Thune acknowledged that the nation’s debt “is unsustainably high” and that one way Congress can fix this is by increasing growth in the nation’s economy, which cannot be done without passing bills to cut spending, which he argued Trump’s bill does.\n\nPaul’s criticism has drawn the ire of the president, who wrote on Truth Social thatthe Kentucky senator has “very little understanding” of his tax billand the incoming “tremendous GROWTH” the nation will experience.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday thatthe “big, beautiful bill” would add $2.4 trillion to the nation’s deficit. However, the CBO score did not account for the possibility of the legislation boosting economic growth, which would create new revenues.\n\nIn addition to extending the 2017 tax cuts that Trump is seeking, the bill cuts taxes by $3.7 trillion over the next decade. Federal spending would also be cut by $1.3 trillion."
