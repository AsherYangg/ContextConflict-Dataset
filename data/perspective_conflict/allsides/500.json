        "source_1": "Former President Donald Trump set the stage for a bruising final month of the presidential campaignduring a return visit to the Pennsylvania venuewhere a gunman attempted to assassinate him this summer.\n\nThe trip was Trump’s latest to the Keystone State,which is shaping up to be the most pivotal in this election cycle. As the rally was ongoing, Trump’s campaign announced two additional Pennsylvania events at which the former president would appear in the coming days.\n\nSpeaking before one of his larger rally crowds of the cycle, Trump attacked Democratic leaders for the federal response to Hurricane Helene, baselessly suggested that the party was working to steal the upcoming election from him and repeatedly went after Vice President Kamala Harrisfor saying in a 2019 ACLU questionnairethat she supported taxpayer funding of gender transition care for immigrants in federal detention facilities.\n\n“Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens in holding bins? I don’t think so,” Trump said during his roughly 90-minute address. Returning to the subject later, he roped in billionaire mogul Elon Musk, who was in attendance at Trump’s rally, saying, “I don’t think Elon likes that idea. These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.”\n\nTrumpfeatured a parade of wealthy benefactors who spoke at the event, including Musk, hedge fund billionaire John Paulson and real estate investor Steve Witkoff.\n\nDuring his remarks, Musk described himself as “not just MAGA, I’m dark MAGA,” offering apocalyptic warnings to rallygoers and viewers.\n\n“One request is very important: Register to vote,” Musk said. “OK? And get everyone you know and everyone you don’t know, drag them to register to vote. … Like, text people now [and] make sure they actually do vote. If they don’t, this will be the last election. That’s my prediction. Nothing’s more important.”\n\nThe stop comes nearly three months after Trump wasshot in the earby a would-be assassin at the same venue on July 13. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by law enforcement on site. Two rallygoers were injured while another, Corey Comperatore, was killed.\n\n“Now you heard the shots, you saw the blood, we all feared the worst,” Ohio Sen. JD Vance,Trump’s running mate, said in a speech preceding the former president, adding that he believed God intervened to spare Trump’s life. “But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’”\n\nMuch of the opening of Trump’s speech was dedicated to Comperatore and the two others who were injured at the July rally. Trump also praised law enforcement who were present during the assassination attempt, saying the countersnipers were responsible for saving “many lives.”\n\n“We have an evil world,” Trump said. “We have a very sick world.”\n\nTrump also held a moment of silence for Comperatore, who he said has “become somewhat of a folk hero.” He met with the fallen attendee’s family prior to his speech on Saturday.\n\n“He was hit hard,” Trump said. “And he gave his life to shield [his loved ones’] lives.”\n\nTrump was somewhat more subdued than at other recent events,such as when hecalled Harris mentally impaired and suggested police be “real rough” with suspected criminals for “one rough hour.” But other speakers filled the void.\n\nTrump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, described the election as a battle between “good versus evil.”\n\nIn his speech, Vance condemned Democrats for labeling Trump as a threat to democracy, directly tying those warnings to the second assassination attempt Trump faced last month.\n\nPointing to Harris, Vance said: “How dare you talk about threats to democracy.”\n\n“Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy,” he added. “What the hell have you done?”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said RNC Chairman Michael Whatley is “working mostly on Stop the Steal” as opposed to get-out-the-vote efforts, which have been thesubject of some Republican consternation. (One outside group tasked with a significant chunk of the GOP turnout effort is asuper PAC tied to Musk.)\n\n“Because we have a lot of votes,” Trump said, adding: “We’re going to win this thing, and the more we win it, you know, it’s too big to rig.”\n\nTrump also spent time discussing the federal response to Hurricane Helene, which has battered western North Carolina as well as parts of Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Trump said the government is only offering flooding victims $750, “and yet they send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of.”\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has said that $750is just one type of assistance it offers, and that there are other programs that victims can qualify for after applying for disaster relief.\n\nTrump touched more briefly on local issues, promoting fracking and saying he will not approveNippon Steel’s agreement to purchase U.S. Steel— a hot topic in western Pennsylvania. Both Harris and President Joe Biden have also come out against the foreign takeover.\n\n“I don’t like that,” Trump said of the possibility of a Japanese company owning U.S. Steel.\n\nLooking ahead to the coming month, the former president predicted that both he and Vance would be the subjects of a number of negative reports.\n\n“One month, we’ve got to get there,” he said. “They’ll still drop all sorts of bombs. They’ll be hitting you, JD, they’ll be hitting me. These people, they’ll hit and hit, but I think we’ve almost become immune to it, haven’t we? We’ve become immune to it.”\n\nTrump heaped praise on the wealthy benefactors present for the rally, calling Witkoff “one of the greatest businessmen in the country” while saying Paulson is “truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker, meaning stocks. He knows what he’s doing.”\n\nHe later used Musk to describe his vision for the American dream.\n\n“We’re going to have the American dream,” Trump said of if he wins next month. “So every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, ‘I want to be like Elon Musk. I want to have, I want to have $200 billion in cash. I’m going to be like Elon Musk.’ That’s the American dream.”",

The rally was held at the same site where Trump was shot by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.\n\n\"As you can see, I am not just MAGA — I am Dark MAGA,\" Musk joked, a nod to the Dark Brandon meme. He called the upcoming Nov. 5 election \"the most important election of our lifetime.\"\n\n\"This is no ordinary election,\" Musk claimed. \"The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.\"\n\nAlthough Musk has become a vocal Trump supporter, the speech marked the first time that the tech entrepreneur stumped at a major presidential rally.
