        "source_1": "Călin Georgescu, a Russia-friendly populist, won first round of election before result was annulled\n\nRomania’s top court has upheld a decision to ban presidential election frontrunner Călin Georgescu from standing in a rerun of the vote in May, sparking protest in Bucharest and leaving the country’s far-right parties four days to find a candidate.\n\nGeorgescu, an anti-EU, Moscow-friendly populist, surged from almost nowhere to win the first round of the country’s presidential election last year, but theresult was annulledby Romania’s top court because of suspected Russian interference.\n\nAmid claims of “massive” social media manipulation, he wasplaced under criminal investigation last monthon six charges including false statements about his campaign financing, fraudulent use of digital technologies and promoting fascist organisations.\n\nRomania’s central election bureau said on Sunday it had decided to bar Georgescu’s candidacy for the rerun of the first-round vote, due on 4 May, ruling it “unacceptable” that he should stand after the constitutional court’s annulment of the November vote.\n\nAfter deliberating for two hours, the constitutional court rejected Georgescu’s appeal against that decision on Tuesday in a unanimous ruling that cannot be challenged. It would publish its reasoning at a later date, the court added.\n\nSeveral hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving Romanian flags and chanting “freedom” and “thieves”. Ana Florescu, 57, said Romania was “not a democracy any more … There is no justice. They have stolen it.”\n\nFlorescu, an economist, said the mainstream political parties that have run the country since the collapse of communism in 1989 had “made so many mistakes. No one trusts them any more. And now they have just cancelled a candidate.”\n\nGabriel Feraru, 63, an engineer, said the entire political class was “afraid of Georgescu because he is anti-system, and they will lose all their corrupt privileges”. He said he would boycott the rerun unless Georgescu endorsed a new far-right candidate.\n\nThe deadline for candidacies is 15 March, giving Romania’s far-right parties, including the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR) and the party of Young People (POT), which had united behind Georgescu’s run, little time to agree on a replacement.\n\nThe former government official told his supporters after the ruling to “follow your conscience” when casting their ballot. “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no freedom, no fraternity for Romanians,” Georgescu posted on social media.\n\n“Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania,” he added in English and French. “While America is becoming great again,Europeand Romania have become petty, corrupt, and under dictatorship.”\n\nGeorge Simion, chairman of the AUR and of the far-right bloc that holds about a third of seats in parliament, said the court’s decision was “a disgrace … Once again, it is mocking the Romanian people, is attacking our democracy and our essential rights.”\n\nMany protesters said they would either boycott the new ballot or vote for an anti-establishment candidate. “I’ll vote for anyone new who isn’t a part of this system. People are fed up with these same politicians,” said Ionel Popa, a 52-year-old taxi driver.\n\nThe decisions to annul the elections and disqualify Georgescu have drawn sharp criticism from Washington. Billionaire Elon Musk posted on social media on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”\n\nThe US vice-president,JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, was leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.\n\nGeorgescu had been polling in single digits before the November election and had declared zero campaign spending. He has lauded Russia’s president,Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders.\n\nHe has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared Jesus Christ to be “the only true science”, claimed Nato would never help Romania and said Bucharest was not very good at foreign affairs and should rely on “Russian wisdom”.\n\nMoscow has denied any link with Georgescu but said on Tuesday any presidential election without him would be “illegitimate”. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Romanian authorities’ decisions as a “violation of all democratic norms”.",

This is just the beginning,” he said in a post on Facebook on Sunday.\n\n“Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny,” he added.\n\nThe decision sparked immediate protests by Georgescu's supporters, who took to the streets in Romania's capital Bucharest, clashing with the police in front of the electoral committee's headquarters on Sunday evening.\n\nOne gendarme was injured in the scuffle when he was hit by a blunt object, but was out of danger, authorities said.\n\nThe protests turned more intense after demonstrators hurled rocks and cobblestones at the gendarmerie, which was forced to use tear gas. The media covering the demonstrations have since been asked to take shelter, according to reports.\n\n\"We appeal to participants to avoid any violations of the law, to remain calm, to demonstrate peacefully and civilly, and to continue the dialogue with the specialised gendarmerie teams,\" the police force said in a statement.\n\nGeorgescu appealed BEC's decision with the constitutional court on Monday, which now has to issue a ruling by Wednesday.\n\nThe first round of the presidential election rerun is scheduled for 4 May.",
        "source_3": "Is Romania the canary in the 'death of democracy' coalmine?\n\nAfter today's news, that canary - along with 'democracy' - is well and truly dead.\n\nIn a stunning turn of events - that we have a feeling could backfire disastrously on the elite establishment -Romania has barred far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu from running in May’s presidential election, in a move that could worsen the country’s political turmoil.\n\nThe Bucharest-based electoral bureau invalidated Georgescu’s candidacy, a spokesman from the bureau said on Sunday.\n\nIt received more than 1,000 challenges to Georgescu’s candidacy mostly related to his so-called anti-democratic and extremist stances.\n\nThe decision can still be appealed at the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe decision to eliminate Georgescu from the May 4 presidential race will likely deepen Romania’s anti-establishment mood and benefit the far-right.\n\nPolls showed that had Georgescu run, he would’ve garnered between 40% and 45% of the vote in the first round, giving him a real chance of becoming Romania’s president.\n\nGeorgescu submitted his candidacy for May’s election - as an independent - reminding voters of the utter farce he has been through over the last coupel of months:\n\n“Everyone is watching Romania and how the corrupt system acted,”said Georgescu on Friday, adding that he thought it’s impossible for his name not to be on the ballot’s list of candidates.\n\nAs a reminder, afteremerging victorious from the first roundof voting in November's presidential election,Romania’s top court in December toannul the outcomeof last year’s presidential vote, which cited suspicions of Russian meddling (via TikTok!?) in his campaign.\n\nFollowing their decision, the Black Sea bordering nation tumbled into itsbiggest political crisis since the collapse of communism.\n\nThe decision has also buoyed the success of Romania’s extremist parties, in a country already disillusioned with the political mainstream,prompting massive protests nationwide...\n\n🇷🇴 Close to 100,000 people on the streets of Bucharest protesting against the decision to cancel the elections and in support of GeorgescuMan tries to find the end of the protest, gives up after he keeps running into masses of peoplepic.twitter.com/EEs7C2ga3P\n\nTwo weeks ago, the prosecutor's office has reportedly imposed the following restrictions on him and his campaign:\n\nA Romanian Court Press Release cites \"attempted incitement against the constitutional order\" (coup), \"spreading false information,\" as well as \"false statements on campaign funding,\" and links to \"fascist, xenophobic, and antisemitic organizations.\"\n\nThe eu needs to be very careful with this powder keghttps://t.co/AdrCmuQq22\n\nWhile Georgescu planned to run as an independent, he is backed by two far-right opposition parties.Recent polls show he’d get about 40% of the vote in the first round of the May ballot.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Georgescu will throw his support behind any of the other candidates, such as the leader of the largest far-right opposition party AUR, George Simion, who backed him after the cancellation of the elections.\n\n🇷🇴🚨BREAKING NEWSThe candidacy of Calin Georgescu for the presidential elections has been rejected by the Electoral Commission.The country is in chaos.Democracy has officially died in Romania and the European Union.Europe has fallen.pic.twitter.com/iCYtC2JFdn\n\nGeorgescu denies any wrongdoingand continues to claim that he received no funding for his campaign last year, which he says was exclusively volunteer-run.\n\n“The Romanian people will always win,” Georgescu said in front of his supporters at the electoral bureau in Bucharest.\n\n“Democracy was killed in December but we are reviving it today.”\n\nThe unprecedented move to annul last year’s election result is still viewed as controversial by most Romanians and was criticized by the Trump administration.\n\nWe suspect those criticisms will turn all the way up to 11 after today's court decision to ban him from actually being on the ballot.\n\nNone of this should be a surprise - as shocking as it is for an elite establishment who constantly crow about \"democracy\".\n\nSimply put, from the perspective of western liberal world order, Georgescu cannot be allowed to win because he takes thecommon sense approach that confrontation with Moscow does much more harm to Romanians than to Russia.\n\nAndRomania is simply too important to NATO and the effort to weaken Russia. Washington and Brussels are already dealing with wayward governments in Hungary and Slovakia, but Romania is a different animal.\n\nRomania is also the site of the $2.7 billion expansion of Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase to make it the largest one in Europe.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that Romania is just the start of annulled elections as the neoliberal war champions who call themselves the “center” would no doubt love the power to cancel elections wherever they see fit.\n\nWe give the last words to Andrew Korybkowho summarized the importance of events in Romania (and their consequences):\n\nThe Romanian “deep state’s” latest attempt to take down Georgescu is essentially a gauntlet thrown at the Trump Administration by its liberal-globalist opponentsin Brussels who fully back Bucharest. They want to test whether the US will do anything in response to the EU’s rolling coup in Romania...\n\nWhat’s unfolding in this Balkan country is nothing less than the opening of anotherNew Cold Warfront, albeit this time an ideological one between liberal-globalists and populist-nationalists, which also interestingly pits nominal NATO allies against one another as the EU and the US take opposite sides.It’s incumbent on the Trump Administration to do what’s needed to ensure that Georgescu is allowed to run as president in May’s election redux and that the vote is truly free and fair instead of flawed as usual.\n\nTo that end, targeted sanctions against Romanian figures, credibly threatening to withdraw its troops from Romania, suspending arms contracts, and extending full political support to populist-nationalist protesters could pressure the authorities into reconsidering the wisdom of doing Brussels’ bidding. At the same time, a comprehensive pressure campaign could also backfire if the German-led EU exploits it as the pretext for deepening its already immense control over Romania, though that could backfire too.\n\nIt was explainedherein response to the likely next German chancellor’s pledge to “achieve independence” from the US that military, economic, and energy factors make that a lot easier said than done.If provoked, like could soon happen if the German-led EU pushes back against the US’ potentially impending pressure campaign on Romania, then Trump could weaponize each of them in his own such campaign against the EU and Germany that he stands a good chance of winning on both fronts.\n\nAltogether, what just happened in Romania places the country at the center of the intra-Western ideological dimension of the New Cold War, which will determine the future of Europe. Liberal-globalists will either entrench their power in full defiance of Trump, possibly at enormous costs to their countries, or they’ll be democratically deposed by populist-nationalists who share the same worldview as his team.This struggle is historic and the consequences of its outcome will reverberate for decades.\n\nFinally, we can't help but feel like JD Vance should be jumping up and down on X right, posting a 'told you so' about Europe's free-speech crushing, democracy-damaging self-implosion as he made cleAR THAT stands on the side of all populist-nationalist movements on the continent."
