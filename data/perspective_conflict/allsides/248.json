The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said.\n\nThe next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements.\n\nThis first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman’s capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nationsclosing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.\n\nAssociated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the “indirect talks” had begun.\n\nAfterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion.\n\n“Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called ‘talks for the sake of talks,’ wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,” he said. “Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.”\n\nThat the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being “direct.”\n\n“I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,” Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. “That doesn’t mean, by the way, that at the margin we’re not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.”\n\nHe added: “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability.”\n\nAraghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as “a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges” — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran.\n\nBadr al-Busaidi, Oman’s foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a “shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.”\n\n“I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,” al-Busaidi wrote on X. “We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.”\n\nWhile the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran’s beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran’s stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.\n\nOne thing it won’t do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — “you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution” — unworkable.\n\nIranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage fromthe Carnegie Corporation of New YorkandOutrider Foundation.

        "source_2": "Iran and the UShave concluded a first round of talks in Oman over Tehran's nuclear programme - the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018.\n\nBoth countries described the meeting as \"constructive\" and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the \"direct communication\" as being key to striking a possible deal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal.\n\nThe talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done.\n\nAt two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round.\n\nThat was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations.\n\nThey were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office.\n\nThe verdict of Iran's lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive.\n\n\"In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,\" he told Iranian state TV.\n\nHis diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president's threats that Iran would face \"great danger\" if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes.\n\nThis meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman's foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi.\n\nWitkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face.\n\nBut Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi – not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening.\n\nIran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken.\n\nIn a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions \"were very positive and constructive\", noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries' \"differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible\".\n\n\"These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,\" the statement added.\n\nAraghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a \"fair agreement\".\n\nAfter the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday.\n\n\"Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television.\n\nThe most important issue at stake is what kind of deal each side would be willing to accept.\n\nTrump sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader via the United Arab Emirates last month, saying he wanted a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible military strikes by the US and Israel.\n\nIran hopes for a deal to limit, but not dismantle, its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nAn unnamed source in Oman told news agency Reuters that the talks would seek to de-escalate regional tensions and secure prisoner exchanges.\n\nTrump revealed the talks would take place during a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House on Monday. The Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday that both leaders had agreed that Iran \"will not have nuclear weapons\".\n\nNetanyahu has called for a \"Libya-style deal\", referring to the north African nation completely dismantling its weapons programme in an agreement reached with Western powers in 2003. That would be completely unacceptable to Iran.\n\nIran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nIranian officials have made it clear the negotiations will focus only on its nuclear programme, not its broader defence capability, such as its ballistic missile programme.\n\nAhead of the talks, Trump said on Friday that he wanted Iran \"to be a wonderful, great, happy country - but they can't have nuclear weapons\".\n\nTrump has warned that the US would use military force if a deal was not reached, and Iran has repeatedly said it will not negotiate under pressure.\n\nBut this process is taking place under immense pressure.\n\nEven as preparations were under way to arrange this first meeting, the US moved more warships and stealth bombers to the region and imposed more sanctions.\n\nThe US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday it would \"be a very bad day for Iran\" if the talks were unsuccessful.\n\nIran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, since Trump pulled out of the 2015 agreement - which expires later this year - Iran has increasingly breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to only enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity for the next 15 years.\n\nIn February, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog reported that Tehran had stockpiled uranium enriched to 60% purity and could swiftly move to 90%, which would be weapons-grade.\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal took nearly two years of intensive negotiations. At the start of this new effort to reach an agreement, Iran's programme is far more developed and complex, and the wider region is far more volatile.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\nBruce, who is currently spokeswoman for the state department, has done \"brilliantly\" according to Trump.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky rules out giving up land, as European security officials meet in the UK.",
        "source_3": "The Trump administration’s first round of negotiations with Iran, aimed at getting the US adversary to scrap its nuclear program, were “very positive and constructive,” the White House said Saturday.\n\nSpecial envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoffwas accompanied by US Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima for the high-stakes meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, which took place in Muscat and marks the first time during President Trump’s second term that US and Iranian officials have met face-to-face.\n\n“The discussions were very positive and constructive, and the United States deeply thanks the Sultanate of Oman for its support of this initiative,” read a statement released by the White House.\n\n“Special Envoy Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations’ differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,” the statement continued. “These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.”\n\nBoth sides agreed to meet for a second round of talks on April 19, according to the White House and Iranian officials.\n\nWitkoff and Araghchi “briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister” as they left the venue in Muscat, Iranianstate media reported.\n\nThe US and Iranian delegations were seated in separate rooms for the majority of the two-hour-long “indirect” meeting, according to Tehran, with an Omani mediator shuttling messages back-and-forth between the two sides.\n\nFour rounds of messages were exchanged before he finally met Witkoff in person, Araghchi said.\n\nThe White House and State Department have not acknowledged the Iranian reports and did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei noted he did “not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.”\n\n“We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions,” Baghaei said.\n\n“The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear — we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran’s national interests,” he added.\n\nWitkoff, who arrived in Oman a day after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as part of negotiations for a cease-fire in the war in Ukraine, was adamant ahead of the Iran talks that the Trump administration will not allow Islamic Republic to develop a nuclear weapon\n\n“I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,” Witkoff told the Wall Street Journal Friday, explaining what he planned on conveying to Iranian officials.\n\nThe special envoy described the provocative action of Iran developing a nuclear weapon as a “red line” the Trump administration would not tolerate, while noting the US is willing to “find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.”\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog discovered in February that Iran was stockpiling enriched uranium just below the threshold needed to produce a nuclear weapon.\n\n“The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon State to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,”read the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reporton Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nTehran had also refused to grant the IAEA’s request to bring in additional inspectors, the report noted.\n\nIran maintains it is not enriching uranium to build a weapon and has long refused calls to dismantle its nuclear program.\n\n“Trump wants a new deal: End Iran’s regional influence, dismantle its nuclear program and halt its missile work. These are unacceptable to Tehran,”one senior Iranian official saidearlier this week.\n\n“Our nuclear program cannot be dismantled,” the officials added.\n\nSaturday’s meeting was “about trust building,” Witkoff said, and not necessarily making significant progress on a new Iran nuclear deal.\n\n“It is about talking about why it is so important for us to get to a deal, not the exact terms of the deal,” the Trump administration official told the WSJ, noting any agreement would need to have substantial verification measures to make sure Iran isn’t working toward building a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt will be up to Trump to determine how to proceed if Iran balks at paring back its nuclear program, Witkoff noted."
