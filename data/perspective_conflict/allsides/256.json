Gretchen Whitmer looks on as President Donald Trump signs executive orders at the White House in Washington, on April 9, 2025. | Chris Kleponis/CNP\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised Gretchen Whitmer in a White House meeting on Wednesday, echoing a bipartisan message the Michigan governor delivered during an earlier speech in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe meeting was Whitmer’s second sit-down with the president since he took office. She raised the ongoing ice storm in northern Michigan, investments in the Selfridge Air National Guard Base outside of Detroit, invasive fish in the Great Lakes and the hottest topic of the day — tariffs — according to a spokesperson for the governor.\n\nTrump spoke positively of Whitmer’s leadership, and even brought her with him to the Oval Office while he signed a number of unrelated executive orders.\n\n“We’re honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, the great State of Michigan, and she’s been, she’s really done an excellent job, a very good person,” Trump said.\n\nWhitmer’s spokesperson said she was “surprised she was brought into the Oval Office” for Trump’s press conference “without any notice.”\n\nWhitmer has emerged as one of the key Democratic contenders to run for president in 2028. Even though the governor insists she is not setting herself up for the White House, Whitmer will come up on her term limit in 2026 and has successfully rallied voters in a state that Trump has carried twice.\n\nAmong the directives Trump signed, heopened investigationsinto two of his first-term aides: former Department of Homeland Secretary official Miles Taylor and former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs. The president accused Taylor of fraud, Krebs of treason, then stripped both their security clearances, repeating false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n“Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said.\n\nWhitmer’s approach with Trump on Wednesday contrasted the staunch criticism that has united much of the Democratic Party’s platform, specifically around tariffs. Other Democratic governors that have been floated as 2028 hopefuls, like Colorado Gov. Jared Polis or Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have denounced the tariffs as a tax on average American families.\n\nWhitmer struck a different tone in her speech, emphasizing their common ground related to building up manufacturing jobs in Michigan.\n\n“I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and here’s where President Trump and I do agree. We do need to make more stuff in America,” Whitmer said. “I’m not against tariffs outright, but they are a blunt tool. You can’t just bust out the tariff hammer to swing at every problem without a clearly defined end goal.”\n\nShe pushed for tariff exemptions for the auto and energy industries, which are crucial to Michigan’s economy. Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs will not include those levied on auto imports.\n\nThe conciliatory relationship is a departure from Trump’s first term, where he and Whitmer repeatedly butted heads — especially on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whenTrump called her inept. He also referred to her as “the woman from Michigan,” which Whitmerreclaimed in a post on X.\n\nAs for Trump’s second term, Whitmer signaled that she’s open to working with the president to help her state.\n\n“If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu,” the governor told journalist Gretchen Carlson at an event on Wednesday.",

Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.\"\n\nRichard Yeselson posted on X:\"Trump, in his feral way, trolled Whitmer, and she displayed terrible political instincts—or just utter carelessness—by letting herself get within a zillion miles of him and a camera. Not a wartime consigliere.\"\n\nRandall Barnes, founder of multimedia company HBCU Pulse, wrote:\"'She just went to the Oval Office! It's not that deep.' First, Gretchen Whitmer didn't just go to the Oval Office. She gave that speech essentially cosigning Trump's tariffs. Then she stood there as Trump signed his BS executive orders. I'm sorry, that's a problem.\"\n\nConservative commentator Bill Mitchell posted:\"Donald Trump just praised Gretchen Whitmer at the White House. She is ruined with the Democrat Party.\"\n\nWhitmer is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027.

Gretchen Whitmer was scheduled to meet with second-term Republican President Donald Trump on Wednesday as the state continues to confront tariff and manufacturing issues.\n\nBefore that meeting, Whitmer delivered a speech near the White House to lay out her long-term ideas to grow American manufacturing and build national defense.\n\nEarlier this year, Whitmer was a vocal critic of Trump’s tariff plans but has been relatively silent since broad taxes on goods entering the country were enacted last week.\n\nIn her speech, she pushed for targeted tariffs rather than the broad measures Trump introduced last week, which sent world financial markets diving.\n\nShe called the tariffs the largest tax increase in 60 years, costing families an average of $1,900 a year and damaging 401(k)s and IRAs, forcing delayed retirements.\n\n“We’re already seeing the impacts,” Whitmer said. \"Auto companies are stockpiling parts and laying off workers. Suppliers are facing higher costs and delaying expansions. Dealerships will be forced to raise prices by up to $15,000 amid slowing sales. And since every auto job supports three others in the community, the impact will be felt by countless small businesses across Michigan, too.\"\n\nHowever, she does agree with Trump on increasing American manufacturing of ships, steel, cars and chips, and said America needs fair trade.\n\n“No state has lived through the consequences of offshoring and outsourcing more than Michigan,\" Whitmer said. \"We know losing a factory doesn’t just mean losing jobs. Losing people means losing resources. It means fewer police officers and underfunded schools. It means less housing built and fewer roads fixed. It’s a loss of purpose and identity.\n\n“So, while I share the president’s goal of bringing good-paying, middle-class manufacturing jobs back home, it’s got to be done right.”\n\nWhitmer’s plan involves carving out the auto and energy industries and placing tariffs on technology officials want to produce in the United States. She also proposed investing new revenue created by tariffs into American businesses and workers.\n\n“As I’ve said before, I’m not against tariffs outright, but they are a blunt tool,\" Whitmer said. \"You can’t just bust out the tariff hammer to swing at every problem without a clearly defined end goal. We also cannot underestimate or underappreciate the time and capital it will take to actually bring jobs and supply chains back home. There’s no shortcut here. Strategic reindustrialization must be a bipartisan project that spans multiple presidential administrations.”"
