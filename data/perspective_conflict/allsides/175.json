        "source_1": "Trump has called on the Fed to lower rates, despite its political independence.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, just weeks after President Donald Trump intensifiedcallsfor lower borrowing costs andvoicedeagerness about the potential \"termination\" of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has dialed back his attacks on Powell, saying he will not fire Powell before the end of the top central banker's term next year. Trump has reiterated his displeasure with the level of interest rates, however, urging the central bank to lower them.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Powell said the economy remains in \"solid shape\" but warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.\n\n\"If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,\" Powell said Wednesday.\n\n\"All of these policies are evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,\" Powell added.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's call for lower rates, Powell shrugged off criticism from the president.\n\n\"It doesn’t affect our doing our job at all,\" Powell said. \"We’re always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks – and that’s it.\"\n\nThe move marked the Fed's second consecutive decision to maintain the current level of interest rates, repeating an approach taken in January. Before that, the Fed had cut rates at three consecutive meetings.\n\n\"For now, it does seem like a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see,\" Powell said.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, said Wednesday that key economic indicators had improved but it cautioned of heightened economic uncertainty.\n\n\"Risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,\" the FOMC said in a statement.\n\nLast month, Powell raised the possibility that Trump's tariffs may cause what economists call \"stagflation,\" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.\n\nIf the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.\n\nStill, Powell pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach as policymakers await the impact of tariffs.\n\n\"For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,\" Powelltoldan audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.\n\nPowell noted the possibility of a shift in economic conditions, saying, \"Life moves pretty fast.\"\n\nThe rate decision arrives days after fresh datashowedrobust job growth in April.\n\nDespite flagging consumer sentiment and market turmoil, the labor market has provided a bright spot since Trump took office. Meanwhile, inflationcooledin March, the most recent month for which data is available.\n\nEven so, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 35% to 45%. JPMorgan pegged the probability of a recession this year at 60%.\n\nA government report last weekshowedthe U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.\n\nU.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figure marked a sharp dropoff from 2.4% annualized growth over the final three months of 2024.\n\nThe rate decision on Wednesday also marks the first adjustment of borrowing costs since Trump's closely watched \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2, which triggered the biggest single-day stock market drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDays later, Trump suspended a major swathe of the tariffs, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases. A simultaneous escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods kept the effective tariff rate at its highest level in more than a century, theYale Budget Labfound.\n\nThe White House is seeking to strike trade agreements with dozens of U.S. trade partners before the 90-day suspension of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" expires in July.\n\n\"As we gain a better understanding of the policy changes, we will have a better sense of the implications for the economy,\" Powell said last month.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.3 percent on Wednesday, defying pressure from PresidentDonald Trumpto lower borrowing costs.\n\n\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,\" the Fed said in a statement. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.\"\n\nThis is the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed has held rates steady.\n\nEconomists and Wall Street analysts still expect two or three rate reductions in 2025, owing in large part to the economic turbulence triggered by Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have clouded the Fed's policy outlook.\n\nIt's rare for the Fed to warn of heightened risks of both inflation and job losses. But economists say that's exactly the dilemma created by import taxes. The tariffs raise prices on imported parts and finished goods, pushing inflation higher. At the same time, companies facing rising costs may cut jobs, pushing unemployment up.\n\nThat puts the Fed in a challenging position. Its dual mandate is to keep inflation in check and support full employment.But Trump's trade policies have created opposing pressures—making it harder for the Fed to use traditional tools like interest rate adjustments to stabilize the economy.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressured him to lower interest rates.\n\n\"Inflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person who's not really doing a good job, but I won't say that,\" Trump said at a rally in Michigan late last month. \"I want to be very nice and respectful to the Fed.\"\n\nHe continued: \"You're supposed to let him do his own thing, but I know much more than he does about interest rates, believe me.\"\n\nKrishna Guha, the head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, wrote:\"The May FOMC statement in effect warns that a large trade shock is still set to hit the economy in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to deescalate, with the Fed seeing the risks ahead as two-sided and not providing any early dovish lean in favor of a June rate cut. The net implications for risk assets are negative.\"\n\nPowell said at a news conference after Wednesday's announcement:\"The economy itself is still in solid shape.\"\n\nThe Trump administration continues negotiating with trading partners after the president announced a 90-day pause in tariffs last months.\n\nReporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

        "source_3": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after the central bank's May meeting.\n\nTheFederal Reserveon Wednesday announced that it will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged as policymakers continue to monitor inflation and the labor market amid elevated levels of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe central bank's decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\nIt comes after the Fed left rates at that level at its two previous meetings in January and March, which followed three consecutive rate cuts at its preceding meetings — which involved a 50-basis-point cut in September and a pair of 25-basis-point reductions in November and December.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which guides the central bank's monetary policy moves, noted in its announcement that \"[u]ncertainty around theeconomic outlookhas increased further\" and the Fed is monitoring risks to both sides of its dual mandate, adding that risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.\n\nWITH THE ECONOMIC TUMULT, A SERIOUS CONCERN HAS EMERGED: STAGFLATION\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is monitoring risks to employment and inflation.(Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\n\"Although swings innet exportshave affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,\" the FOMC wrote. \"The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"\n\nFederal Reserve ChairJerome Powellsaid in remarks following the announcement that the economy is in a \"solid position\" despite \"heightened uncertainty\" and noted that inflation has \"come down a great deal, but has been somewhat above our 2% longer-run objective.\"\n\n\"The new administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in four distinct areas — trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation,\" Powell said. \"The tariff increases announced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated. All these policies are still evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain. If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment.\"\n\n\"Theeffects on inflationcould be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and ultimately on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored,\" he added, noting the Fed's \"obligation\" is to help anchor those inflation expectations.\n\nImports surged in Q1 as companies looked to bring goods into the U.S. before higher tariffs took effect.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nPowell was asked by a reporter how the central bank would approach itsdual mandategoals of maximum employment and stable price growth with inflation at 2% over the long run if it finds itself in a scenario where those goals are in tension. That could occur in a period of stagflation, with rising inflation and slow economic growth and a potentially weak labor market.\n\n\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make, and we're not in this situation. But the situation is if the two goals are in tension — so let's say that, hypothetically, but we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they're expected to be from the goals, what's the expected time to get back to their goals, we'd look at all those things and make a difficult judgment,\" Powell said.\n\nUS JOB GROWTH COOLED IN APRIL AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Fed chair was also asked about what his gut tells him about how the economy is evolving and replied, \"My gut tells me that uncertainty about the economy is extremely elevated, and that the downside risks have increased.\"\n\n\"The risk is, as we pointed out in our statement, the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen, but they haven't materialized yet. They really haven't, they're not in the data yet. So that tells me, more than by intuition, I think it's obvious, actually, that the right thing for us to do is — we're in a good place, our policy is in a very good place, and the right thing to do is to await further clarity,\" Powell said. \"Usually things clarify, and the appropriate direction becomes clear.\"\n\nFOX Business' Edward Lawrence asked Powell about the potential for interest rate cuts this year and whether that would be appropriate given the economic uncertainty and potential for higher inflation.\n\n\"It's going to depend. I think you have to just take a step back and realize this is why we are where we are,\" he replied. \"We're going to need to see how this evolves. There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn't, and we just don't know. Until we know more about how this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment and for inflation, I couldn't confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.\"\n\nINFLATION GAUGE FAVORED BY FED SHOWED PRICE GROWTH SLOWED IN MARCH\n\nThe Fed holds its next meeting in mid-June.(Nathan Howard/Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\nFollowing the Fed's announcement, themarket sees a higher probabilitythat the central bank will hold off on interest rate cuts at its next two meetings. The probability of rates staying at the current range of 4.25% to 4.5% in June rose from 69% to 75% compared with yesterday, while the likelihood of staying at that range in July rose from 22% to 30%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\n\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate — unemployment and inflation — because of tariffs,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"\n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, noted that the \"committee toned down the concern over the negative GDP figure in Q1 given the impact from net exports, which tells us that despite volatile markets, the current state of the U.S. economy shows expanded activity at a solid pace.\"\n\n\"Patience is a virtue and the Fed seemingly has an abundance of it relative to other market participants, so until we see some further signs of a weakening economy, the Fed will remain on the sidelines,\" Ripley added.\n\nThe FOMC is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting on June 17-18.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
