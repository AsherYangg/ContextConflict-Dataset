Kennedy Jr. testifies during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in June. He announced in May 2025 that he was ending Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for children and for pregnant people. | Mariam Zuhaib/AP\n\nA coalition of doctors’ groups led by the American Academy of Pediatrics filed a lawsuit Monday against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arguing that his May announcement that the government would no longer recommend Covid-19 vaccines for healthy pregnant people and children violated longstanding norms governing U.S. immunization policy.\n\nThe organizations say Kennedy’s May 19 “Secretarial Directive” documenting his move to pull the vaccine from the CDC’s immunization schedule constitutes a final agency action ripe for challenge, noting that he cited no emergency or specific circumstantial changes to support the move.\n\n“The Secretarial Directive is contrary to the wealth of data and peer-reviewed studies that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccines for children and pregnant women,” the plaintiffs said in the lawsuit.\n\nHHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOrganizations on the challenge include the American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\nThe directive, they wrote, has put doctors “in the untenable position of telling their patients that the country’s top-ranking government health official’s advice and recommendations are wrong and that we are right.”\n\n“This erodes trust, which is the foundation of a healthy physician-patient relationship and vital to the success of AAP members’ medical practices,” they added.\n\nThe groups are asking a federal judge to order the restoration of the Covid vaccine recommendations to the immunization schedules for children and for pregnant people and to bar HHS from enforcing or publicizing the May directive.\n\n“Pediatricians cannot stay silent as the system we rely on to support lifesaving vaccines is chiseled away piece by piece,” AAP President Susan Kressly told reporters after the lawsuit was filed. “With Secretary Kennedy leading efforts to sow doubt and distrust in the American success story of vaccines, we are on a dangerous path.”\n\nKennedy announced the change in a May 27 videoposted to X, in which he was flanked by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, both of whom gained notoriety during the Covid pandemic for their opposition to mask and vaccine mandates.\n\nThethree officials said there wasn’t sufficient datato show healthy children and healthy pregnant women benefited from Covid vaccination. “Most countries have stopped recommending it for children,” Makary said in the video.\n\nThe administration later distributed a document explaining the decision to lawmakers. The document said studies have shown that women who got the vaccine during pregnancy had higher rates of various complications,but authors of those studiestold POLITICO that the administration had misinterpreted their results.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case said Kennedy had unlawfully sidelined the CDC and its independent vaccine panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which are the federal bodies responsible for the immunization schedule.\n\n“The statutory scheme that regulates the vaccine infrastructure in this country demonstrates Congress’ repeated policy decision to require that ACIP recommendations, made by a fairly balanced ACIP membership, be the basis for what is put on or taken off of the CDC immunization schedules — not the unilateral decision of a single individual,” the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nPublic and private insurers are largely obligated to cover ACIP-recommended vaccines with no cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act, and states often tie their daycare and school vaccine requirements to the panel’s recommendations.\n\nWhile the CDC ultimately didn’t pull the recommendation from the childhood schedule, it did downgrade it to one involving “shared decisionmaking” — a differentiation the physician groups say has made it harder for providers to counsel patients and for practices to assess insurance coverage.\n\nMonday’s lawsuit doesn’t directly challenge Kennedy’s decision last month tofire all 17 ACIP membersandreplace them with several vaccine skeptics. But Richard Hughes, an Epstein Becker Green attorney representing the plaintiffs, told reporters he expects future HHS decisions finalizing recommendations by the new panel will spur them to “amend our complaint to reflect those injuries.”\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6-3 last month topreserve a preventive health coverage provisionof the Affordable Care Act that was based on a different advisory panel’s recommendations. But the decision emphasized the HHS secretary’s authority to reject or slow-walk U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, and Kennedy is widely seen as having broad power to remake ACIP specifically as he sees fit.\n\nStill, Dr. Georges Benjamin, APHA’s executive director, said the groups hope “this lawsuit will force them to go back to providing a rational, scientifically evidence based, transparent process to decision-making.”\n\nIf Kennedy is “not relying on sound science — if we’re seeing pretext and bias running roughshod over really important, longstanding processes and procedures — that’s arbitrary and capricious, and that is unlawful,” Hughes added.\n\nThe AAP’s lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, where a landmark vaccine policy case set national precedent in the early 20th century. The Supreme Court’s 1905Jacobson v. Massachusettsdecision upheld states’ authority to mandate vaccinations.\n\nMany states, such as Massachusetts, also tie their legal scopes of practice for pharmacists to prescribe and administer vaccines to ACIP’s recommendations, Hughes said.\n\n“It is an immediate disconnect, it’s an immediate disintegration of laws that rely on ACIP recommendations, and that is what is causing the injury,” he said. “There’s a whole chain reaction to the secretary’s actions.”\n\nThe case has been assigned to Judge William Young, a Reagan-era appointeeoverseeing a First Amendment casechallenging the Trump administration’s bid to deport pro-Palestinian academics.",

        "source_3": "A coalition of medical groups and a pregnant physician on Monday sued Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the agency he leads over changes made to Covid vaccine recommendations.\n\nThe suit, led by the American Academy of Pediatrics, argues that a May 19 directive that the government would no longer recommend Covid vaccines for healthy pregnant people and children violated long-standing norms governing immunization policies in the U.S. and undermined public trust.\n\nPlaintiffs — which include a total of six medical organizations — argue that the Department of Health and Human Services and its leader, Kennedy, acted \"arbitrarily and capriciously\" when making the change. Kennedy is a longtime skeptic of vaccines.\n\n\"This administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,\" Richard Hughes said in a statement. Hughes is a partner at the law firm Epstein Becker Green and plaintiffs' lead counsel. \"If left unchecked, Secretary Kennedy will accomplish his goal of ridding the United States of vaccines, which would unleash a wave of preventable harm on our nation's children.\"\n\nRepresentatives of HHS didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges HHS and Kennedy are aiming to \"mislead, confuse, and gradually desensitize the public to anti-vaccine and anti-science rhetoric, and that (Kennedy) has routinely flouted federal procedural rules.\"\n\nPlaintiffs say those actions include blocking communications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suit also notes unexplained cancellations of vaccine panel meetings at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration. Earlier this year, HHS canceled an annual meeting for an FDA panel to discuss which strains to include in this year's flu shots. The FDA later provided its own guidance on which strains to include without the panel's input.\n\nKennedy also announced plans to study a potential link between vaccines and autism.\n\nMost recently, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and added his own handpicked members. The group is in charge of recommending who receives which vaccines and when.\n\nKalVista Ends Its Unexpectedly Messy Path To Approval In HAE Treatment\n\nRobert F.
