        "source_1": "Updated on:  October 30, 2024 / 1:05 PM EDT/ CBS News\n\nWashington— Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night delivered her closing argument against former President Donald Trump at the same site he encouraged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" on Jan. 6, 2021, before theymarched to the U.S. Capitoland tried unsuccessfully to halt the certification of President Biden's victory.\n\n\"We know who Donald Trump is,\" Harris said. \"He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election, an election that he knew he lost.\"\n\n\"America, we know what Donald Trump has in mind. More chaos. More division. And policies that help those at the very top and hurt everyone else. I offer a different path. And I ask for your vote,\" she said.\n\nHarris' speech, in front of a massive crowd at the Ellipse near the White House, was meant to draw a contrast between her vision for the country and Trump's as she seeks to win over undecided voters a week beforeElection Day. The Harris campaign estimated there were 75,000 people in attendance, with crowds overflowing onto the National Mall all the way to the Jefferson Memorial.\n\nShe called her Republican rival \"unstable,\" \"obsessed with revenge,\" \"consumed with grievance\" and \"out for unchecked power.\" She said Trump would return to the White House \"with an enemies list,\" while she would \"walk in with a to-do list.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That's who he is,\" she said. \"But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are.\"\n\n\"We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,\" she said. \"I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America.\"\n\nHarris also pledged to make Americans' lives better through \"common sense solutions\" and \"seek common ground.\"\n\n\"I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and to people who disagree with me. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me arethe enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table,\" she said.\n\nPreviewing the speech, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said the Ellipse was chosen because \"it's a place that certainly we believe helps crystallize the choice in this election.\"\n\n\"We know a lot of these undecided voters, they're exhausted,\" she said. \"They're certainly frustrated by the state of the partisanship and divided political system that really was defined under Donald Trump.\"\n\nOn Monday, Harris told reporters that Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a day earlier underscored her argument against him. Speakers at Trump's event madeoffensive, crude and racist remarksabout minorities and Harris.\n\n\"That's whypeople who formerlysupported Donald Trump, have voted for him, are supporting me, voting for me,\" she said. \"He fans the fuel of hate and division, and that's why people are exhausted with him.\"\n\nWhile getting ice cream in Baltimore, Maryland, on Tuesday, Mr. Biden told reporters he would be watching Harris' speech. Explaining why he would not be there in person, he said, \"because it's for her, it's her night.\"\n\nNidia  Cavazos,Paulina  SmolinskiandAaron  Navarrocontributed to this report.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

She mentioned him 24 times. And she attacked Trump from the start, criticizing him for his response to the insurrection on January 6th.\n\nKamala Harris speaks on the Ellipse to make her closing argument\n\nShe spoke from the same spot he spoke on January 6th, 2021, when he encouraged his supporters to march on theCapitolto overturn theelectionresults.\n\nThe striking contrast in images is what Harris' campaign was going for, saying they picked they location deliberately.\n\n'Donald Trump sat in the White House, watching as the violence unfolded on television,' Harris said.\n\n'He was told by his staff that the mob wanted to kill his own vice president and Donald Trump responded with two words: so what?'\n\n'And that's who is asking you to give him another four years in the Oval Office,' she added.\n\nThe night was the grand, sweeping event her campaign wanted.\n\nThere were about 75,000 people cheering Harris on - with only a few interruptions from Gaza protesters - and all the cable networks carrying her remarks.\n\nThe only hiccupwas something President Joe Biden said Tuesday on a Zoom call with Voto Latinothat started getting oxygen around the same time.\n\nBiden - reacting to a pro-Trump comedian calling Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' - said 'the only garbage I see out there is his supporters.'\n\nThe president tried to play clean-up almost immediately as his dig went viral, being likened to Hillary Clinton's 'basket of deplorables.'\n\n'Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage - which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say,' Biden posted to X Tuesday night.\n\nTrump said it was 'worse' than what Clinton said eight years ago.\n\nHer remarks, delivered from the same spot Donald Trump spoke from on January 6th, 2021, were carried by all the cable networks\n\nSupporters could be seen stretching back outside the security perimeter across the National Mall, with the Jefferson Monument seen in the background\n\nThrongs of Harris supporters were packed onto the Ellipse and waved American flags Tuesday night in Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris tried tackling the area where she is most political vulnerable: border security.\n\nTrump and Republicans have attacked her repeatedly on the migration issue.\n\nIn her remarks, she pledged to remove illegal migrants who came to the country unlawfully if she becomes president.\n\n'When I am president, we will quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels and give border patrol the support that they so desperately need,' Harris said.\n\nShe repeated her pledge to pass a border security bill that was killed in Congress earlier this year after Trump encouraged Republicans to do so.\n\n'I will work with Democrats and Republicans to work on the border security bill for Donald Trump killed,' she said.\n\nShe also noted: 'At the same time, we must acknowledge we are a nation of immigrants. And I will work with congress to pass immigration reform, including an earned path to citizenship for hardworking immigrants like farmworkers.'\n\nHer campaign said Tuesday night's speech would be Harris' 'closing argument' to voters.\n\nNoting her background as a prosecutor, the campaign pointed out she has laid out the evidence and the facts and was not ready to make her final pitch.\n\nThe central argument of that pitch is that she is not Donald Trump.\n\n'I offer a different path. And I ask for your vote,' Harris said.\n\n'I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. And two people who disagree with me - unlike Donald Trump - I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail I'll give them a seat at the table,' she noted.\n\nDonald Trump is seen addressing supporters on January 6, 2021\n\nDoug Emhoff joined Kamala Harris on stage after her remarks\n\nHarris called on the country to reject 'the schemes of wannabe dictators' and to 'start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told'\n\nHarris called on the country to reject 'the schemes of wannabe dictators' and to 'start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.'\n\n'I pledge to be a president for all Americans,' she vowed.\n\n'I'm not perfect. I make mistakes but here's what I promise you: I will always listen to you even if you don't vote for me. I will always tell you the truth - even if it is difficult to hear,' she said.\n\n'Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list when elected, I will walk in with a to-do list to get done for the American people and I will work with everyone: Democrats, Republicans and independents to help Americans who are working hard and still struggling to get ahead,' she said.\n\nAnd she referenced her childhood as the daughter of immigrants, specifically referring to her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who migrated from India with the goal of curing breast cancer.\n\n'I've lived the promise of America. I saw how hard our mother worked to give her daughters the same chances this country gave her. Growing up, I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who instilled in me the values of community, compassion, and faith. They have always defined our nation at its best,' Harris said.\n\nProtesters were outside the event to protest the situation in Gaza\n\nSupporter of Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attend a rally on the National Mall one week before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, in Washington, U.S., October 29, 2024.

Snipers were also on the look out.\n\nBut once attendees made it onto the Ellipse, they were greeted with a party-like atmosphere, where Pretty Tammi the DJ - dressed in Harris' sorority colors - was blasting modern hits, including from singer and actress Jennifer Lopez.\n\n'Make some noise for Puerto Rico!' she said from the raised platform, a shout-out clearly aimed at those hateful comments made by the pro-Trump comedian at Madison Square Garden Sunday night.\n\nNow J.

Denver Riggleman - who's leading Harris' GOP outreach in Virginia - and Matthew Friend, the comedian known for his dead-on impressions of American presidents, who performed earlier this year at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.\n\nOutbursts from Pro-Palestinian protesters peppered her remarks.\n\nOne demonstrator held a hand-written 'Stop Arming Israel' sign.\n\nSupporters asked for EMTs to remove a man who continued to yell 'arms embargo now' even as he was escorted out.\n\nJust beyond the metal security gates, Palestinian flags could be seen - and a large Trump sign.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
