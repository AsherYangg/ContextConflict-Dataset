        "source_1": "The US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the Trump administration has beenpursuing a diplomatic dealwith Tehran, multiple US officials familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.\n\nSuch a strike would be a brazen break with President Donald Trump, US officials said. It could also risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East — something the US has sought to avoid since the war in Gaza inflamed tensions beginning in 2023.\n\nOfficials caution it’s not clear that Israeli leaders have made a final decision, and that in fact, there is deep disagreement within the US government about the likelihood that Israel will ultimately act. Whether and how Israel strikes will likely depend on what it thinks of the US negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\nBut “the chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly in recent months,” said another person familiar with US intelligence on the issue. “And the prospect of a Trump-negotiated US-Iran deal that doesn’t remove all of Iran’s uranium makes the chance of a strike more likely.”\n\nThe heightened worries stem not only from public and private messaging from senior Israeli officials that it is considering such a move, but also from intercepted Israeli communications and observations of Israeli military movements that could suggest an imminent strike, multiple sources familiar with the intelligence said.\n\nAmong the military preparations the US has observed are the movement of air munitions and the completion of an air exercise, two of the sources said.\n\nBut those same indicators could also simply be Israel trying to pressure Iran to abandon key tenets of its nuclear program by signaling the consequences if it doesn’t — underscoring the ever-shifting complexities the White House is navigating.\n\nCNN has asked the National Security Council and the Israeli prime minister’s office for comment. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not comment.\n\nTrump has publicly threatened military action against Iran if his administration’s efforts to negotiate a new nuclear deal to limit or eliminate Tehran’s nuclear program fail. But Trump also set a limit on how long the US would engage in diplomatic efforts.\n\nIn a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in mid-March, Trump set a 60-day deadline for those efforts to succeed, according to a source familiar with the communication. It has now been more than 60 days since that letter was delivered, and 38 days since the first round ofv talks began.\n\nA senior Western diplomat who met with the president earlier this month said that Trump communicated that the US would give those negotiations only weeks to succeed before resorting to military strikes. But for now, the White House policy is one of diplomacy.\n\nThat has put Israel “between a rock and a hard place,” said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure both to avoid a US-Iran deal that Israel doesn’t view as satisfactory, while also not alienating Trump — who has already broken with the Israeli prime minister on key security issues in the region.\n\n“At the end of the day, the Israeli decision-making is going to be predicated on US policy determinations and actions, and what agreements President Trump does or does not come to with Iran,” Panikoff said, who added that he did not believe Netanyahu would be willing to risk entirely fracturing the US relationship by launching a strike without at least tacit US approval.\n\nIran is in its weakest military position in decades, after Israel bombed its missile production facilities and air defenses in October, combined with an economy weakened by sanctions and Israel’s decimation of its most powerful regional proxies. Israel, US officials say, sees a window of opportunity.\n\nThe US is stepping up intelligence collection to be prepared to assist if Israeli leaders decide to strike, one senior US official told CNN. But a source familiar with the Trump administration’s thinking told CNN the US is unlikely to help Israel carry out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites at this moment, short of some major provocation by Tehran.\n\nIsrael does not have the capacity to destroy Iran’s nuclear program without American assistance, including midair refueling and the bombs required to penetrate the facilities deep underground, a need that is also reflected in previous US intelligence reports, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAn Israeli source told CNN that Israel would be prepared to carry out military action on its own if the US were to negotiate what this source described as a “bad deal” with Iran that Israel cannot accept.\n\n“I think it’s more likely they strike to try and get the deal to fall apart if they think Trump is going to settle for a ‘bad deal,’” said the other person familiar with US intelligence. “The Israelis have not been shy about signaling that to us … both publicly and privately.”\n\nAUS intelligence assessmentfrom February suggested Israel could use either military aircraft or long-range missiles to capitalize on Iran’s degraded air defense capabilities, CNN previously reported.\n\nBut the same assessment also described how such strikes would only minimally set the Iranian nuclear program back and wouldn’t be a cure-all.\n\n“It’s a real challenge for Netanyahu,” Panikoff said.\n\nFor now, the US talks with Iran are stuck on a demand that Tehran not enrich uranium, a process which can enable weaponization, but which is also necessary to produce nuclear power for civilian purposes.\n\nSpecial envoy Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, told ABC News over the weekend that Washington “cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability” under an agreement. “We’ve delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them,” he said.\n\nKhameneisaid on Tuesdaythat he does not expect negotiations with the United States over Tehran’s nuclear program to “reach a conclusion,” calling the US demand that Iran not enrich uranium a “big mistake.” Iran insists it has a right to enrich under the United Nations’ Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and says it will not relinquish that right under any circumstances.\n\nAnother round of talks may take place in Europe this week, according to Witkoff. Both the US and Iran have put proposals on the table, but after more than a month of the talks facilitated by Oman, there is no current US proposal with Trump’s sign-off, sources said.\n\nUS intelligence agencies in February issued warnings that Israel will likely attempt to strike facilities key toIran’s nuclear programthis year, CNN previously reported.\n\nIt has “consistently been the Israeli position that the military option is the only option to stopping Iran’s military nuclear program,” one US official noted.\n\nCNN’s Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, Alex Marquardt and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nU.S. intelligence has gathered new indications that Israel may be preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran as PresidentDonald Trumpwarns that time is running out to secure a nuclear agreement.\n\nAccording toCNN, the intelligence includes intercepted Israeli communications, observations of Israeli military movements, and statements from senior Israeli officials suggesting that preparations for a strike could be underway.\n\nNewsweekhas reached out to the State Department and the foreign ministries of Iran and Israel for comment.\n\nAn Israeli strike on Iran would mark a significant rupture with the Trump administration, which is currently engaged innuclear talkswith Tehran. A unilateral move by Israel could shatter the fragile diplomatic efforts and potentially trigger a broader conflict across theMiddle East. Officials quoted in the report noted that while Israel lacks the capability to eliminate Iran's nuclear program without U.S. assistance, it may act independently if it views the final deal as inadequate.\n\nTheCNNreport said the U.S. has gathered intelligence based on Israeli military movements, internal discussions, andcompleted air exercises. Some U.S. officials see these actions as part of a pressure campaign on nuclear talks, while others view them as signs of a real operational plan.\n\nA source familiar with the intelligence said the likelihood of a strike has risen \"significantly in recent months,\" especially if a deal fails to remove Iran's uranium stockpile. Despite this, Israeli leadership has not made a final decision, and there is disagreement within the U.S. government about whether an attack will occur.\n\nTrump has warned that his offer of diplomacy with Iran will not remain on the table indefinitely, threatening \"maximum pressure,\" including driving Iranian oil exports to zero, if talks fail. U.S. officials have emphasized that a complete halt to uranium enrichment is a non-negotiable demand, with Special Envoy Steve Witkoff calling it a red line due to concerns over potential weaponization. Iranian leaders have rejected the demand, with Supreme LeaderAyatollah Ali Khameneicalling it \"excessive and outrageous,\" and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying that enrichment is a sovereign right.\n\nSince April, Iran and the U.S. have participated in four rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman—the highest-level engagement since Trump exited the 2015 nuclear deal. Their last meeting on May 11 was described by Iran as \"difficult but useful,\" while a U.S. official said the administration was \"encouraged.\"Araghchi recently told reporters that Oman will officially announce the time and place of the fifth Iran-U.S. talks soon.\n\nTrita Parsi, Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft toldNewsweek:\"I don't believe we are very close (to a deal). The American proposal contains some interesting ideas, but I find it very unlikely that Tehran will agree to freeze enrichment at all levels. The cost of restarting enrichment - even if the U.S. violates the deal and causes its collapse - is so high that the proposal gives me very little confidence.\"\n\nU.S. Special Envoy to the Middle EastSteve Witkoff said:\"We cannot allow even one percent of an enrichment capability... Everything begins from our standpoint with a deal that does not include enrichment.\"\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X:\"Enrichment in Iran, however, will continue with or without a deal.\"\n\nA new round of U.S.-Iran talks in the works, but officials acknowledge that the timeline for diplomacy is short—and theconsequences of failurecould be immediate and severe.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nAmir Daftari is a Newsweek reporter based in London, specializing in global affairs with a focus on the Middle East.
