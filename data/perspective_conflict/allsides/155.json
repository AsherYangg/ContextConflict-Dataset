        "source_1": "Prosecutors confirm 21 charges, with brothers due to be extradited to the UK after conclusion of Romanian proceedings\n\nUK prosecutors have confirmed they have authorised 21 charges against influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.\n\nAndrew Tate, 38, faces 10 charges including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain; charges connected to three alleged victims.\n\nTristan Tate, 36, faces 11 charges including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking; charges connected to one alleged victim.\n\nThe two British-Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges, which they deny.\n\nA Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have authorised charges against Andrew and Tristan Tate for offences including rape, human trafficking, controlling prostitution and actual bodily harm against three women.\n\n“These charging decisions followed receipt of a file of evidence from Bedfordshire police.\n\n“A European arrest warrant was issued in England in 2024, and as a result the Romanian courts ordered the extradition to the UK of Andrew and Tristan Tate.\n\n“However, the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first.\n\n“The Crown Prosecution Service reminds everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendants have the right to a fair trial.\n\n“It is extremely important that there be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”\n\nAn international arrest warrant was issued by Bedfordshire police for the siblings over allegations dating back to between 2012 and 2015, which they deny.\n\nThey are already facing prosecution in Romania over allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.\n\nA separate case against them, in which they are accused of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, has been sent back to prosecutors.\n\nThe pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.\n\nAndrew Tate is also being sued by four other women after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute in 2019. He has denied the allegations.\n\nLawyer Matt Jury, representing several alleged British victims of Andrew Tate, said: “We welcome the clarity from the Crown Prosecution Service that our authorities are working to ensure the Tates face justice here in the UK – they cannot be allowed to escape extradition.\n\n“At the same time, we ask once more that CPS admit its mistake in failing to prosecute Tate when he lived in the UK and finally charge him for the rape and assault of the other three women, our clients, who originally filed criminal complaints against him as long ago as 2014 but were failed by the system. They deserve justice, too.”\n\nThe allegations were subject to a Hertfordshire police investigation, which was closed in 2019.\n\nThe Tates are the sons of an American chess master, who also served in the US air force as a sergeant, and a British catering assistant. The brothers were raised on an estate in Luton, Bedfordshire.\n\nAndrew Tate is a former professional kickboxer who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, sharing his lifestyle of supercars, expensive watches and private jets.\n\nHe runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women.",
        "source_2": "Prosecutors have confirmed for the first time the full list of 21 charges Andrew and Tristan Tate will face when they are returned to the UK, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said that it had authorised the charges against the brothers in 2024, before an extradition warrant was issued to bring them back from Romania.\n\nThe two British-Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges, which they deny - and the CPS said \"the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first\".\n\nThe CPS's charging decision came after it received a file of evidence from Bedfordshire Police about allegations made in the UK.\n\nThe CPS said Andrew Tate, a 38-year-old influencer and former kickboxer, faces 10 charges connected to three alleged victims, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain.\n\nTristan Tate, 36, faces 11 charges connected to one alleged victim, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.\n\nThe pair were both born in the US but moved to Luton in the UK with their mother after their parents divorced.\n\nIn recent years, Andrew Tate, a self-described misogynist, has built a massive online presence, including more than 10 million followers on X, sharing his lifestyle of fast cars, private jets, and yachts.\n\nHe and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking.\n\nThey both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year and a half later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations in Romania including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.\n\nSeparately, the pair were detained in Bucharest in March 2024 after Bedfordshire Police said it had obtained an arrest warrant in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking.\n\nAccording to the brothers' legal representatives, the UK allegations dated back to between 2012 and 2015. At the time of the arrest warrant, the Tates said they \"categorically reject all charges\" and were \"very innocent men\".\n\nA Romanian court ruled that they could be extradited to the UK only once the separate proceedings against them in Romania concluded.\n\nThey were then released from custody. Prosecutors unexpectedly lifted a two-year travel ban earlier this year, after which the brothers travelled from Romania to the US state of Florida by private jet in February 2025.\n\nThey returned to Romania in March 2025, telling reporters that \"innocent men don't run from anything\".\n\nThe brothers say they registered with Bucharest authorities in a legal formality to demonstrate their compliance with an ongoing criminal investigation. Andrew did not say whether he would remain in Romania, but vowed to clear his name there and in the UK.",
