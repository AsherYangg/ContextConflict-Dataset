        "source_1": "PresidentDonald Trumpon Friday said that he ordered twonuclear submarines\"to be positioned in the appropriate regions\" in response to warnings made to theUnited Statesthis week by high-ranking Russian officialDmitry Medvedev.\n\nMedvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war onUkraine\"is a threat and a step towards war.\"\n\n\"Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,\"Medvedev wrote on Xthat day.\n\nTrump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days toless than two weeks his deadlinefor Russian PresidentVladimir Putinto reach apeace dealwith Ukraine or face big \"secondary tariffs\" on Moscow's trade partners.\n\nOn Friday, Trump wrote in aTruth Social post, \"Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.\"\n\n\"Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances,\" Trump said. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\nMedvedev, in his tweet Monday, wrote, \"Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10… He should remember 2 things.\"\n\n\"1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\" Medvedev wrote.\n\n\"Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!\" Medvedev added, referring to former PresidentJoe Biden.\n\nTrump in a Truth Social post on Thursday warned Medvedev about his rhetoric, while also taking a shot on Russia's trading partnership with India.\n\nI don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,\" Trump wrote. \"We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.\n\n\"Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together,\" Trump said. \"Let's keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. He's entering very dangerous territory!\"\n\nMedvedev responded Thursday with a statement saying, \"If a few words from a former Russian president can provoke such a nervous reaction from the sitting and supposedly formidable president of the United States, then clearly Russia is entirely in the right and will continue on its chosen path.\"\n\n\"As for his remarks about the 'dead economies' of India and Russia and 'venturing into dangerous territory,' perhaps he should revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical 'Dead Hand' can be,\" Medvedev said.\n\nThe Dead Hand is Russia's system for automatically launching nuclear strikes if a nuclear attack is detected against the country.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances\".\n\nHe did not say where the two submarines were being deployed, in keeping with US military protocol.\n\nMedvedev has recently threatened the US in response to Trump's ultimatums to Moscow to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face tough sanctions.\n\nRussia and the US possess the most nuclear arms in the world, and both countries have a fleet of nuclear submarines.\n\nIn Friday's post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Based on the highly provocative statements of the former president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions.\"\n\nThe US president did not say whether he was referring to nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines in his post on Truth Social.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later the same day, Trump said: \"A threat was made, and we didn't think it was appropriate. So I have to be very careful.\n\n\"I do that on the basis of safety for our people. A threat was made by a former president of Russia. And we're going to protect our people.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has so far made no public comments on the issue, but Moscow's stock market fell sharply following Trump's statements.\n\nTrump and Medvedev have recently been involved in a series of personal attacks against each other on social media.\n\nIt comes after Trump set a new deadline forcurrent Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring the war to an end by 8 August - which Putin has shown no signs of doing.\n\nBefore that, on Monday, Trump had set a \"10 or 12\" day deadline. Earlier in July he threatened Russia with severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports if Putin did not end the war in 50 days.\n\nMedvedev - who was Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 - accused Trump of playing \"the ultimatum game with Russia\" earlier this week.\n\nIn a post on X, Medvedev said \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\".\n\nHe also described Trump's ultimatum as \"theatrical\" earlier in July, saying that \"Russia didn't care\".\n\nWriting on Telegram on Thursday, Medvedev warned of a \"dead hand\" threat - which some military analysts understood as a reference to the codename of Russia's retaliatory nuclear strikes control system.\n\nFriday wasn't the first time Trump responded to Medvedev's comments. On Thursday, he described Medvedev as \"the failed former president of Russia, who thinks he's still president\".\n\nTrump also warned Medvedev to \"watch his words\", adding that \"he's entering very dangerous territory!\"\n\nMedvedev supports Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in 2022, and is an outspoken critic of the West.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.",
