        "source_1": "Joe Biden says his team negotiated deal but Donald Trump claims it was agreed now only because he is about to become president\n\nThe question yelled atJoe Bidenby a reporter was unapologetically blunt: “Who do you think deserves credit for this Mr President: you or [Donald] Trump?”\n\nBiden had just finished announcing what he presented as his signature foreign policy achievement – aceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamasto halt the bloody war in Gaza that has left 46,000 Palestinians and 1,700 Israelis dead. He wasn’t in the mood for that debate.\n\n“Is that a joke?” the president asked and then walked away flanked by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, and secretary of state, Antony Blinken.\n\nSuccess has many fathers. When the ceasefire inGazawas finally announced on Thursday, they all stood up to take the credit.\n\nBiden said in a press conference that the ceasefire was “developed and negotiated by my team and will be largely implemented by the incoming administration”. As he praised his diplomats, he grew wistful: “The Bible says blessed are the peacemakers. Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen.”\n\nBut there was little public soul-searching about why the planhe had proposed in May– the exact same plan, as Biden reminded reporters – was finally accepted only days before Trump’s inauguration.\n\nThat fact did not escape the attention of President-elect Trump. “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” he said in a post on his social media network, Truth Social.\n\nThe truth may lie somewhere in the middle. According to a senior Biden administration official, Trump and Biden’s teams forged an unlikely partnership to secure the complex ceasefire during a transition marked by animosity and distrust.\n\nAs the deal was announced on Wednesday, there were even notes of bonhomie between the rival teams, with Biden administration officials praising the partnership between the diplomat Brett McGurk and Trump’s envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff.\n\n“It was really quite remarkable,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.\n\nBiden had told Trump he wanted to work together to secure a deal when the two met in the Oval Office shortly after Trump’s surprise victory in the November elections, according to the official.\n\nIn the final days of the negotiation this month, Witkoff, who does not hold any formal position in government, was invited to travel to Doha alongside the Biden administration officials taking part in negotiations.\n\nIn one extraordinary moment, the official said,Witkoff was dispatchedon his own to Israel to meet with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a high-stakes gambit to convince him to take the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu, which took place duringShabbatover the initial objections of Netanyahu’s aides, was described as “tense”, according to Israeli media. Reports said that Witkoff put pressure on Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and agree to key concessions to halt the war sooner.\n\n“I thought that was quite effective,” the Biden administration official said.\n\nThe Times of Israel, citing its own sources, put it less charitably for the Biden camp: “Arab officials: Trump envoy swayed Netanyahu more in one meeting than Biden did all year.”\n\nIn his public statements on the deal, Netanyahu appeared to snub Biden, calling Trump first to thank him “for his help in advancing the release of the hostages and helping Israel to bring an end to the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families”.\n\nAfter relaying plans to come to Washington to meet Trump to discuss the situation around Gaza, he added a curt line about his work with Biden: “Prime Minister Netanyahu then spoke with US President Joe Biden and thanked him as well for his assistance in advancing the hostages deal.”\n\nLeaked details of the meeting between Netanyahu and Witkoff may have elements of “theater to give Netanyahu cover for finally accepting a deal”, said Matt Duss, the executive vice-president at the Center for International Policy and a former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders. “But also, I think the fact is that Netanyahu understands that Trump is coming into office. He’s made clear he wants this war to end, and Trump operates according to a very different calculus than Biden.\n\n“Biden has always made clear that no matter what Netanyahu does, he will continue to have unconditional, unstinting American support. Netanyahu cannot be sure of that with Trump.”\n\nIn the US, Biden has faced attacks from the right and left on his handling of the war, as well asanger among officialswho believed that the US was not putting sufficient pressure on Israel to halt its campaign in Gaza.\n\nDozens of officials at the state department have bristled in public and private at the administration’s handling of the war, arguing that Biden and his aides’ refusal to threaten to halt deliveries of arms and other aid to Israel may have prolonged the military campaign.\n\nA Pentagon official previously said the ceasefire was “being driven by Trump’s team … and Biden, Blinken and the whole administration secured its legacy as enablers”.\n\nPro-Trump Republicans have been equally scathing about Biden’s efforts to end the war, although they have targeted him as too soft on Hamas.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas on Thursday said that the deal was “encouraging but obviously we know that President Biden has not been the best negotiator when it comes to these deals”.\n\nTrump had previously warned that “all hell will break out in the Middle East” if a deal was not reached before his inauguration.\n\nAsked whether those threats may have led to the ceasefire, Cornyn replied: “I don’t believe in coincidences. So I do believe that President Trump had an impact on this deal. And obviously the Biden administration is eager to wrap this up.”\n\nYet the sharpest anger against Biden over the war has beenvoiced by progressives, who have said that the administration’s overwhelming support for Israel may have both prolonged the war and cost the Harris campaign crucial votes on the left in the November elections.\n\nThe ceasefire had come too late, some said, and would do little to burnish Biden’s legacy on foreign policy.\n\n“No one’s going to buy that Biden delivered this ceasefire. No one,” said Duss. “He continued to give Netanyahu political cover, even as Netanyahu repeatedly undermined the possibility of a ceasefire.”",

        "source_3": "President Biden had a curt response to a question posed by Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich on Wednesday regarding whether President-elect Trump deserves credit for the recent Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal.\n\nIncoming President Donald Trump has repeatedly issued stern warnings to Hamas in the past few weeks, saying that there will be \"hell to pay\" if Israeli hostages are not released by the time he returns to office on Jan. 20. Wednesday's announcement that an agreement between Israel and Hamas was near, providing for a temporary cease-fire and the release of 33 Israeli hostages, made clear that the \"Trump Factor\" played a pivotal role in pushing this deal forward.\n\nTRUMP PROMISES ‘HELL TO PAY’ IN MIDDLE EAST IF HOSTAGES ARE NOT RELEASED BEFORE HE TAKES OFFICEThese 33 Israeli hostages to be freed under the deal, along with 65 others still held by Hamas in Gaza in sub-human conditions for the past 466 days, were snatched from their homes and their beds on a Saturday morning of the Jewish holiday of Simchat on Oct. 7, 2023. Ever since that day, their names and faces have become one with the Israeli collective. Their stories have become our own. Israelis are immensely grateful to President-elect Trump for his commitment and tenacity, as well as to the thousands of brave Israeli men and women of the IDF who have risked life and limb to resurrect Israel from the horrible failure of that fateful day.\n\nMemorials at the site of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im, Israel, are pictured on May 27, 2024.(Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nThe hostages' return is both painful and joyous for Israelis traumatized by the war. Reuniting those innocent people with their families brings tears of joy to our eyes, knowing well the kind of torment, suffering, torture and abuse they suffer at the hands of Hamas' merciless and cruel captors. Yet, it is also a harsh reminder of the magnitude of Israel's failure and of the need to guarantee that such an event never happens again.Trump's \"hell to pay\" was a clear message not just to Hamas, but to all rogue actors of the Middle East. It was a manifestation of the incoming administration's clear moral vision and ability to tell right from wrong, a vision that has the chance to herald a new episode in the future of this tumultuous and fickle region. A clear line stretches between this statement and January 2020, when, at the direction of then-President Trump, the U.S. military took out Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.\n\nNewly released records from the FBI prove that Iran was behind a potential assassination attempt on former President Trump.(Getty Images)\n\nSoleimani was the architect of evil, responsible for the Islamic Regime's \"Ring of Fire\" doctrine, surrounding Israel with hostile forces including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as supporting other nefarious terrorist forces, such as the Houthis in Yemen. The assassination of Soleimani sent shock waves through the region and the ranks of the Islamic Republic's leadership, which promised revenge against Trump himself and senior officials in his administration.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn launching the barbaric and ferocious Oct. 7 attack against Israel, Hamas' leader, Yahya Al-Sinwar, was hoping to see all elements of this \"Ring of Fire\" converge and attack Israel in a desire to change the Middle East forever. Four hundred sixty-six days into the war, it is clear that the Middle East has changed forever, but in the opposite direction.Iran and its proxies have suffered significant setbacks. Hamas in Gaza has been decimated. The Assad regime in Syria was toppled, and in Lebanon, a new president and prime minister have been elected, both against the will of a much-weakened Hezbollah.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIsrael is about to go through an excruciating period of seeing our hostages come back from the darkness of Gaza as we eagerly await the rest to return home.Yet, on the horizon, a new future looms: one of \"hell to pay\" for the Middle East's rogue actors, enveloped by hope for peace through strength.\n\nShahar Azani is the former spokesperson of Israel’s Consulate in New York and a veteran Israeli diplomat.
