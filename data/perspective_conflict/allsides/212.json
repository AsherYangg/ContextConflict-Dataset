        "source_1": "The headquarters for National Public Radio (NPR) is seen in Washington, D.C.Charles Dharapak/APhide caption\n\nPresident Trump issued an executive order late Thursday directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's board of directors to \"cease federal funding for NPR and PBS,\" the nation's primary public broadcasters, claiming ideological bias.\n\n\"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to tax-paying citizens,\" the order says. \"The CPB Board shall cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and shall decline to provide future funding.\"\n\nIt is not clear that the president has the authority to make such orders to CPB under the law.\n\nPBS President and CEO Paula Kerger called it a \"blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle of the night.\"\n\nCPB isalready suingthe Trump administration over his executive order seeking to fire three of its five board members; on Friday, it dismissed the validity of the president's new order.\n\n\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" the corporation wrote in a statement issued Friday morning. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\"\n\nThe CPB noted that the statute Congress passed to create it \"expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.\"\n\nCongress said that such funds \"may be used at the discretion of the recipient\" for producing or acquiring programs to put on the air.\n\nTrump's newest order appears to envision a continuation of federal subsidies for public radio and television stations — apart from NPR and PBS. It is unclear how that squares with Trump's pledge toask Congress to rescindall funds already approved for public broadcasting.\n\nCongress allocates federal funding for CPB and specifies how it shall be spent. The funding is carried out in two-year cycles, ahead of time, a structure designed to help shield public media from political pressure.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has waged rhetorical warfare against it, fueling and channeling his supporters' distrust of traditional newsgathering.\n\nOn social media platforms, Trump recentlyblastedthe two national public broadcasting networks, posting in all caps: \"REPUBLICANS MUST DEFUND AND TOTALLY DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM NPR & PBS, THE RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS' THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!\"\n\nNPR vowed to fight back in a statement released Friday by Heather Walls, its senior vice president of communications.\n\n\"We will vigorously defend our right to provide essential news, information and life-saving services to the American public,\" NPRsaidin the statement. \"The President's order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities.\"\n\nIt said the executive order jeopardizes the national airing of NPR newscasts, and programs likeMorning EditionandTiny Desk Radio.\n\nThe leaders of NPR and PBStestified at a House oversight committee hearingin March on allegations of ideological bias in public broadcasting.\n\nRepublican lawmakers assailed NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher for political messages she had posted to social media years before she joined NPR in March 2024, as well as news decisions the network made largely before her tenure.\n\nPBS' Kerger found herself queried about a video involving a performer in drag singing a variation on a children's song for a young audience. (Kerger testified that the video was posted on the website of PBS' New York City member station and never aired on television.)\n\nEarlier this week, the Federal Election Commissionunanimously dismisseda complaint of bias and illegal electioneering against NPR, finding that the network is engaged in a \"legitimate press function.\"\n\nFederal funding for public media flows through the congressionally chartered Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Congress allocated $535 million for the CPB for the current fiscal year — an amount affirmed in a recent stop-gap bill passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. House and Senate.\n\nAccording to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Congress has fully funded it through Sept 30, 2027.\n\nAt the hearing in late March, heads of both networks spoke of the mission to provide nonpartisan news and programming to the American public, without charge. They said stations would be most vulnerable if federal funding was cut off for public broadcasting.\n\nNPR typically receives about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government, and a slightly greater amount indirectly; its 246 member institutions, operating more than 1,000 stations, receive on average 8% to 10% of their funds from CPB.\n\nBy contrast, PBS and its stations receive about 15% of their revenues from CPB's federal funds.\n\nMost of the funds for public media go to local stations; and most to subsidize television, which is more expensive than radio.\n\nThe Trump administration's assault on public media began just weeks after his inauguration. Trump's appointee as the nation's chief broadcast regulator, Federal Communications Commission Chairperson Brendan Carr, launched an investigation of NPR and PBS, contending it appears that their corporate underwriting spots violate laws banning commercial advertisements. Carr has used it to question federal funding of the networks and their non-commercial status.\n\nThe networks say they have been encouraged repeatedly by the agency and Congress to develop private financial support and have worked assiduously for years with the FCC to ensure that content falls within FCC guidelines.\n\nPBS offers a heavy amount of educational fare; NPR relies more on news and music. Both provide locally grounded content and reach more than 99% of the population, at no cost. In many states and communities, the stations also serve as a key component of emergency and disaster response systems.\n\nWhile the CPB is suing the Trump administration over the attempted firings of three of the five board members, were Trump to succeed in doing so, it would appear he would have, for now, erased the quorum necessary for the CPB board to take any actions. That includes, presumably, the elimination of funds for PBS and NPR.\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp, Managing Editor Gerry Holmes and Managing Editor Vickie Walton-James.

        "source_3": "President Trump signed an executive order late Thursday terminating federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).\n\nNPR and PBS, which have long been targeted for cuts by conservatives, both receive partial funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which the president argued is unnecessary in the current media environment.\n\n“Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,” Trump wrote in the order.\n\n“The CPB Board shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration’s policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage,” he added. “The CPB Board shall cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and shall decline to provide future funding.”\n\nTrump further directed the CPB to end indirect funding to NPR and PBS, including by “ensuring that licensees and permittees of public radio and television stations, as well as any other recipients of CPB funds, do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS.”\n\nThe president gave the CPB until June 30 to effectuate his directive.\n\nNPR and PBS both have diverse revenue streams, including major foundation grants, advertising and voluntary viewer and listener donations, meaning that neither is likely to cease operations if they lose federal support.\n\nThe CPB is set to receive$535 million in congressionally appropriated fundsannually to distribute to public broadcasters in 2025 and 2026.\n\nPBS and its member stations receive about 15% of their revenues from the CPB, while NPR stations get 10% of their funds from the corporation,according to NPR.\n\nTrump had previously called for NPR and PBS to be defunded in a March Truth Social post.\n\n“NPR and PBS, two horrible and completely biased platforms … should be DEFUNDED by Congress, IMMEDIATELY,” he wrote on March 27.\n\nIn his late-night order, the president argued that “Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.”\n\n“No media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies, and the Government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize.”\n\nA White House fact sheet on the order suggested that the left-leaning networks’ output acts as a “significant in-kind contributions to the Democrat party and its political cause,” therefore violating the CPB’s legal mandate to be “nonpolitical [in] nature.”\n\n“The CPB fails to abide by these principles to the extent it subsidizes NPR and PBS,” the order stated. “Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter. What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”\n\nIn addition to eliminating CPB payments to NPR and PBS, Trump ordered all federal agencies to “identify and terminate” any taxpayer money going to the public broadcasters.\n\nTrump also tasked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. with determining whether PBS and NPR “are complying with the statutory mandate that ‘no person shall be subjected to discrimination in employment … on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.’”\n\n“In the event of a finding of noncompliance, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate corrective action,” the order read."
