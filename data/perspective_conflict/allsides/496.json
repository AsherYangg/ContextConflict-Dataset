She responded, “In this crisis — like in so many issues that affect the people of our country — I think it so important that leadership recognizes the dignity” to which people are entitled.\n\n“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,” Harris added.\n\nThose comments came after the former president spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, offering sympathy to people affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, the latter of which came ashore in Florida Wednesday night. But Trump also suggested that the Biden administration’s response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Helene.\n\n“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” said Trump, who has for several dayspromoted falsehoodsaboutthe federal response.\n\nHarrisvirtually attended a briefing, held in the White House Situation Room with President Joe Biden, on emergency efforts in Milton’s wake. In subsequent comments to reporters, BidenslammedTrump and his supporters for spreading misinformation about federal assistance available to victims.\n\n“They’re being so damn un-American with the way they’re talking about this stuff,” Biden said, then adding directly to Trump: “Get a life, man. Help these people.”\n\nDespite the storm, Trump and Harris are both visiting key swing states strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nIn Michigan, where he’s looking to appeal primarily to blue-collar voters, Trump took a swipe at the city he happened to be campaigning in, suggesting that Detroit was “a mess.”\n\n“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” he said of Harris. “You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nHarris responded that Trump “yet again has trashed another great American city when he was in Detroit, which is just a further piece of evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president of the United States.”\n\nThe former president used his appearance at the Detroit Economic Club to echo core themes from his 2016 campaign, saying some other countries, especially China, are ripping the U.S. off and taking manufacturing business away. Trump said powerful companies have “raped” the United States.\n\n“They’ve been screwing us for so many years that we’re allowed to get some of that back,” Trump said about charging tariffs from countries.\n\nEconomists warnTrump’s proposed tariffswould drive up consumer costs. Trump has also claimed, without providing specifics, that he can use tariffs to reduce the U.S. budget deficit and pay for an expansion of childcare funding, even as he proposes other ideas without saying how he would replace the lost funding.\n\nBut the former president seemed to not understand the difference between the budget deficit and trade imbalances, conflating the two different economic measures as essentially being the same thing.\n\nHe noted that the federal government has nearly $36 trillion in total debt, a byproduct of the annual borrowing needed to cover the gap between tax revenues and government spending. Except Trump then seemed to indicate that the debt was a byproduct of the trade deficit with China — which is a separate issue that reflects the difference between how much a country exports and how much it imports.\n\n“We have $36 trillion in debt,” Trump said. “For years and years and years, we’ve been accumulating. We’d have these deficits that are monstrous. We had 5,6,7 $800 billion deficit with China.”\n\nHe also claimed that “we had the highest job numbers in my administration,” but that isn’t true any longer. The unemployment rate fell slightly lower under Biden — to 3.4% early last year, the lowest in a half-century, below 3.5% before the pandemic under Trump.\n\nHarris held a rally near Phoenix after participating in the town hall for the Spanish-language network Univision. She’s looking to increase support among Hispanic voters, especially men.\n\nHer campaign began a group this week known as “Hombres con Harris” — Spanish for “Men for Harris” — that is planning to hold events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day.\n\nAt Univision’s “Latinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds” event, Ivett Castillo, 40 and a Las Vegas resident, told Harris that she’s an American citizen born to two Mexican parents and that her mother died six weeks ago. She cried as she asked the vice president about “plans to support that subgroup of immigrants here their whole lives and who live and die in the shadows.” When the town hall ended, Harris went over and clasped hands with Castillo, whose face was still streaked with tears.\n\nIn response to her question, Harris noted that Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office seeking to create pathways to U.S. citizenship for many people in the country illegally that was never considered.\n\nUnauthorized border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration before declining this year after the president issued an executive order restricting asylum claims.\n\nAnother audience member asked Harris to explain how she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, prompting her to respond, “President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous a president could make.”\n\nShe said Biden “put country before personal interest” and “urged me to run.”\n\nHispanic voters are about evenly split on whether to trust Harris or Trump to do a better job handling the economy, but they give the former president an edge on handling immigration. Hispanic women are more likely to trust Harris to better handle the economy and immigration, and Hispanic men are more likely to trust Trump on both issues, according to polling from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLater, in Arizona, Harris praised the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain for defying his party and voting to preserve the Obama administration’s signature health care law. That drew extended cheers while people in the crowd made thumbs-down gestures to signify McCain’s opposition to the GOP effort to repeal it.\n\n“It was late, late, late in the night and they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act again,” Harris recalled of the Senate vote. “And the late, great John McCain, the great American war hero ... said: ‘No you don’t. No you don’t. No you don’t.’”\n\nHarris also deviated from her usual campaign speech to urge Arizonans to vote in a state referendum to safeguard abortion rights and talked about preserving tribal rights and responsible water policy.\n\n“I promise you as president I will continue to invest in drought resilience,” Harris said.\n\nVolmert reported from Detroit.

Among the misinformation: Trump alleged that federal funding was being redirected to aid people in the country illegally and that disaster relief was capped at $750. Biden clarified that the $750 figure refers to an immediate disbursement intended to cover urgent needs, such as food, diapers and baby formula.\n\n\"That $750 that they're talking about, Mr. Trump and all those other people know it's a lie to suggest that's all they're going to get,\" Biden said during his address on Thursday. \"It's just bizarre. They got to stop this. They're being so damn un-American with the way they're talking about this stuff.\"\n\nBiden was also asked if he planned to speak directly with Trump, but the president said he had no plans to do so. Instead, Biden said to the TV cameras at the event: \"Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life, man. Help these people.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden remarked that first responders working to save lives had faced \"death penalties,\" though it was unclear if he intended to say \"death threats.\"\n\nTrump and a number of hisRepublicanallies have been pushing unsubstantiated claims this week concerning the response of Biden and Vice PresidentKamala Harristo Helene, which left over 200 people dead and dealt massive damage to infrastructure when it ripped through the Southeast last week.\n\nOn Thursday, an op-ed published by a newspaper in Trump's home-state of Florida, slammed the former president's recent remarks, calling them \"garbage.\"\n\nTheMiami Heraldopinion piece, written by David Mastio, criticized Trump's assertions about federal emergency management, namely \"Trump's allegation that the Biden-Harris administration has 'stolen' funds meant for natural disaster relief to deal with the man-made crisis at the border in which millions of immigrants flooded our country in large part because the Biden-Harris administration loosened Trump-era asylum restrictions.\"\n\nTrump also falsely claimed that Republican GovernorBrian Kempof Georgia, with whom he held a joint news conference concerning disaster relief efforts, was unable to speak with Biden about federal disaster assistance over the phone.\n\nWhile appearing onCNNlast week, Geoff Duncan, the Republican former lieutenant governor of Georgia, who endorsed Harris in the 2024 election, slammed Trump's remarks.\n\n\"It's a sobering reminder of where theRepublican Partyis at right now, and how deep in the gutter we truly are,\" Duncan told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"To think that we're going to use this platform to politicize...one of the worst storms to hit this region ever.\"\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMatthew Impelli is a Newsweek staff writer based in New York.

Can you believe it?” Trump said, apparently referring to Cooper’s podcast.\n\n“She did nothing as people struggled on the ground,” he added.\n\n“Despite all of this, Kamala Harris said she wouldn’t do anything – she’s not going to do anything differently.”\n\nGoing back to Harris’ appearance on “The View,” Trump argued that “her answer that she would do nothing different is disqualifying.”"
