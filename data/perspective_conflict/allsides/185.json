        "source_1": "Household energy bills will be higher over the next decade now that Republicans have passed their tax and spending bill, according to a new analysis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are phasing out tax credits that lower the cost to build wind and solar, which are now largely cheaper than fossil fuels like natural gas and coal.\n\nMore wind and solar on the electric grid helps keep utility bills lower, and Biden-era tax credits would have ramped up those projects.\n\nWhen combined with the electric vehicle consumer tax credit being cut (you can still get the EV tax credit through September 30, 2025) annual electricity and transportation costs in every state in the continental United States will be higher than they would have if the tax credits stayed intact, analysis from think tank Energy Innovation found. Energy Innovation did not model data for Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nEnergy Innovation modeled transportation costs like gasoline for cars, as well as household electricity and heating costs in their analysis.\n\nRed states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% higher energy costs by 2035 if Trump’s bill passes, compared to a scenario where the bill didn’t pass.\n\nAnnual household energy costs could rise $640 a year in Missouri by 2035 and $630 a year in Kentucky. That’s because these states would have otherwise been set to deploy a massive amount of wind and solar if Biden-era energy tax credits were left in place. Now that the GOP bill has been passed aggressively phasing out those credits, these states will have to lean on fossil fuels to generate power.\n\nBlue states that are deliberately putting more clean energy onto their grids would still see prices rise over the coming decade, albeit far less, Orvis said. They are more immune to price shocks because they won’t be as heavily reliant on gas and coal.\n\n“You’re moving from not using a lot of fossil fuels to using a lot of fossil fuels. That makes the price go up a lot,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.\n\nEnergy analysts expect the cost of natural gas and the cost of building new gas-powered plants will increase, and with it, consumer energy bills.\n\n“Everybody’s electricity prices are going to go up,” said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “I think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power. New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.”\n\nPowell’s group was not involved in the Energy Innovation analysis, but has produced their own analysis with NERA Economic Consulting, also finding repealing the tax credits would raise household energy costs.\n\nPowell added it’s an especially bad time for solar and wind tax credits to go away because there is simply more demand for electricity, with data centers and electrification of homes and vehicles. Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to theUS Energy Information Administration, which predicts they will continue to rise through next year. US natural gas prices have also gone up, and theEIA predictsthey will continue to do so next year.\n\nOn the transportation side of things, the Energy Innovation model predicts that without a $7,500 consumer tax credit to help defray the cost of electric vehicles, more people will continue to drive gas powered cars.\n\n“That increases the spending a lot, plus that gasoline is actually a little bit more expensive because there’s so much more demand for it,” Orvis said.\n\nRed states will see the biggest price hikes. Oklahoma energy consumers will see their bills rise 13% by 2035, or about $540 in annual costs. Oklahoma is already a wind energy powerhouse, with wind generating close to 44% of the state’s electricity. With the Biden-era energy tax incentives, Oklahoma was set to see another huge spike in wind development that could have made the state’s electricity generation carbon-free, the Energy Innovation modeling found.\n\nOklahoma could have become “a major exporter of electricity, because there’s so much wind being deployed,” Orvis said. “The loss of the tax credits means a lot less wind gets deployed, and that’s replaced with in-state fossil resources.”\n\nSouth Carolina, another state expected to see a 13% price hike in annual energy costs with Trump’s bill, generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear, with natural gas supplying much of the remainder. Orvis said South Carolina stood to add a lot of solar to its electrical grid with tax incentives but would have to revert back to gas once those credits go away.\n\n“You’re going from gas setting that price to renewables, and when you undo the tax credits, you see it reverting back to gas,” Orvis said.\n\nThis story has been updated with a new analysis from Energy Innovation, using the language in the spending bill that was passed by the Senate and House.",

        "source_3": "Small businessesmake up 99.9% of all American businesses, but they are too often ignored in Washington, and the debate around the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is no exception. While there has been discussion about the bill’sprice tag and spending cuts, less attention has been paid to how the bill’stax policieswill help small businesses.\n\nSmall businesses across the country, including the wholesaler-distributors and equipment manufacturers that we represent, have been hit by high prices and economic uncertainty and are in desperate need of policies that will help them grow. The “big, beautiful bill” achieves exactly that by enacting numerous tax policies to help businesses reinvest in their workforce, expand their operations, and grow the economy.\n\nFor instance, the legislation makes the 199A small business deduction permanent and expands it to 20%. This will provide relief and certainty to over 25 million businesses, according toIRS data. Since it was first enacted in 2017, the deduction has helped support 2.6 million jobs, $161 billion in annual employee compensation, and $325 billion in GDP, based onresearchby EY.\n\nThe legislation also includes key provisions that will help small businesses invest, such as the restoration of immediate expensing for research and development costs and a 100% bonus depreciation for investing in new equipment. Restoring R&D expensing — a policy that existed for 70 years until it expired in 2022 — will help businesses innovate, adopt the next generation of technologies, and stay competitive. Similarly, 100% bonus depreciation will help businesses invest in new equipment and machinery by allowing them to deduct these costs immediately, rather than depreciate them over many years.\n\nIn addition, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act expands and makes permanent the estate tax exemption, providing relief for family-owned businesses. Currently, family-owned businesses must pay the 40% death tax every time they pass the business down from one generation to the next. These businesses are often asset-rich but cash-poor. Instead of taking out loans, liquidating existing assets, or deferring new investments in technology or equipment, this bill would enable more family-owned businesses to invest more in themselves.\n\nThere is clear evidence that these policies and other tax cuts will help workers and small businesses across the country. According toa reportby the Council of Economic Advisers, over the next four years, the bill will increase long-run GDP by as much as 4.9% and raise annual real wages by as much as $7,200 per worker, or $10,900 for a family with two children.\n\nThis will build on the success of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which helped create the strongest economy in modern history. Thanks to these tax cuts, the unemployment rate hit 3.5% in 2019, a 50-year low, while real median household income increased by $4,400 in 2019, or nearly 7%.\n\nAs a direct result of the TCJA, small businesses could expand or invest in new factories and warehouses, hire new workers, increase pay for existing employees, and offer new career development and benefit programs for the workforce.\n\nFor instance, First Supply, a fifth-generation plumbing wholesaler-distributor headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, was able to reinvest in existing facilities, increase mentorship, apprenticeship, and wellness programs, and relaunch its e-commerce program.\n\nBIG, BEAUTIFUL VOTE-A-RAMA AMENDMENTS: WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED, AND DID THEY PASS OR FAIL?\n\nOver in Salisbury, North Carolina, the TCJA helped concrete paving equipment manufacturer Power Curbers invest in research and development. The company spent years and several million dollars — a significant investment for a company of its size — developing a new machine for mainline highway concrete paving. Without the tax incentives from the TCJA, the machine would not exist today.\n\nIf history is any indication, enacting pro-growth, pro-small business tax policies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will allow businesses to make even more investments that support workers and the economy. With the passage of the big, beautiful bill, lawmakers will demonstrate their commitment to helping America’s small businesses thrive and to helping the economy grow.\n\nKip Eideberg is the senior vice president of government& industry relations for theAssociation of Equipment Manufacturers, which represents off-road equipment manufacturers and suppliers. Alex Hendrie is the senior vice president of government relations at theNational Association of Wholesalers-Distributors, which represents the wholesale distribution industry."
