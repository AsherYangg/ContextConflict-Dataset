        "source_1": "About 30 lawmakers are headed to Illinois for a week to hinder Republicans’ redistricting plan pushed by Trump\n\nTexasDemocratsare leaving the state to prevent a vote on Monday that could see five newRepublican-leaning seats created in the House of Representatives.\n\nAbout 30 Democrats said they planned to decamp toIllinois, where they plan to stay for a week, to thwart Republican efforts by denying them a quorum, or the minimum number of members to validate the vote’s proceedings.\n\nIn a statement, Texas Democrats accused their counterparts, the Texas Republicans, of a “cowardly” surrender toDonald Trump’s call for a redrawing of the congressional map to “continue pushing his disastrous policies”.\n\n“Texas Democratic lawmakers are halting Trump’s plan by denying his bootlickers a quorum,” the statement read.\n\nThe scheme to leave the state is reported to have been put together by theIllinoisgovernor, JB Pritzker, who met with the Texas Democratic caucus late last month and has directed staff to provide logistical support for their stay.\n\nThe Texas grouphas accusedthe Texas governor, Greg Abbott, of withholding aid to victims ofGuadalupe River floodinglast month in an attempt to force the redistricting vote through.\n\n“We’re leaving Texas to fight for Texans,” Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic caucus chair, said in a statement. “We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander.\n\n“We’re not walking out on our responsibilities; we’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent,” Wu added. “As of today, this corrupt special session is over.”\n\nLast week, Texas Republicansreleased a proposed new congressional mapthat would give the GOP a path to pick up five seats in next year’s midterm elections, typically when the governing party loses representation in Congress.\n\nThe areas affected by the redistricting plan would target Democratic members of Congress in and around Austin, Dallas and Houston, and two districts in south Texas that are Republican but nudging closer toward Democrat control.\n\nThe plan to temporarily vacate the state is not without potential consequences. Members of the Texas Democrats face a $500-a-day fine and possible arrest, a measure that was introduced in 2023, two years after Democratsleft the statefor three weeks to block election legislation that included several restrictions on voting access.\n\nUltimately, that bill passed but not beforeDemocratswere able to claim something of a moral victory after stripping the measure of some of its provisions.\n\nThe latest plan to leave the state came after a House committee approved new congressional maps on Saturday.\n\n“This map was politically based, and that’s totally legal, totally allowed and totally fair,” Cody Vasut, a Republican state representative and committee member,told NBC News.\n\nVasut pointed to disparities in other states,including California, New York and Illinois, where the weighting of seats to votes is strongly in Democrats’ favor.\n\n“Texas is underperforming in that. And so it’s totally prudent, totally right, for Texas to be able to respond and improve the political performance of its map,” he said.\n\nThe political backdrop to the Texas redistricting fight colors Pritzker into the picture of a national fight. Pritzker, a billionaire member of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain, is seen aslooking toward a bidfor the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn June, he addressed Democrats in Oklahoma where he met privately in a “robust” meeting to discuss about Texas redistricting, according to NBC News. He later met with Texas Democrats, where offered assurances he would find them hotels, meeting spaces and other logistical assistance.\n\nThe absence of the Democrats on Monday threatens to derail other issues Abbott is proposing, including disaster relief after to the deadly central Texas floods last month.\n\n“Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton,said in a post on X. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.”\n\nThe Texas house speaker, Dustin Burrows,saidthat if, at 3pm on Monday, “a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table”.",
        "source_2": "Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to try to stop a vote on a new congressional map that would heavily favour Republicans.\n\nThe proposed redistricting - unveiled by Texas's majority Republicans last week and backed by President Donald Trump - would create five new Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives. Republicans currently have only a slender majority in the House.\n\nTwo-thirds of the 150-member state legislature must be present in order to hold a vote. Fifty-one Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas, most of them to Illinois, denying Republicans the required quorum.\n\nThey said they plan to stay away for two weeks until the end of a special legislative session.\n\nThat session was convened by the Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is a Republican himself. He has threatened to try to remove from office any lawmakers who fail to return to Texas for a vote.\n\nThe session in the Texas legislature is being held to provide disaster relief after last month's deadly floods in the state, and to ban THC, the active ingredient in cannabis - as well as approving the planned electoral redistricting.\n\nEach of the 51 absent lawmakers could face a $500 (£380) fine for every day they are away, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, has threatened to have them arrested.\n\nPaxton wrote on X that the state should \"use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law\".\n\n\"Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,\" he added.\n\n\"We're not walking out on our responsibilities,\" said state legislator and chairman of the Democratic caucus Gene Wu.\n\n\"We're walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent.\"\n\nState Democrats received the backing of national party figures. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the group were showing \"courage, conviction and character\".\n\nWhile Democrats nationwide have threatened tit-for-tat tactics, their options may be limited.\n\nIn states where they handle the redistricting process, such as Illinois, New Mexico and Nevada, Democrats have already gerrymandered just as eagerly as Republicans.\n\nThe most recent Illinois map, for example,received an F grade from the Princeton Gerrymandering Projectbecause it was rated so politically unfair.\n\nBut in other Democratic-controlled states, such as New York, California, Colorado and Washington, redistricting is handled by non-partisan, independent commissions, rather than the state legislatures.\n\nTexas Republicans currently hold 25 out of 38 congressional seats in the Lone Star State.\n\nThey hope the new maps could increase that number to 30 - all in constituencies that Trump won last November by at least 10 points.\n\nAhead of next year's nationwide midterm elections, Texas' redistricting could help pad the slender Republican majority in the House, which is the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nTrump's party currently has 219 of 435 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 212.\n\nThe new map would include a redistricting of the Rio Grande Valley and combine two districts in the state capital of Austin currently held by Democrats.\n\nIn northern Texas, the map would expand a district currently held by Democratic congresswoman Julie Johnson to include rural Republican strongholds.\n\nIt would also redraw four Houston-area seats, including one held by Democratic congressman Al Green.\n\nTexas state legislator Todd Hunter, a Republican who sponsored the measure to redraw the map, called it \"a good plan for Texas\".\n\nThis is the third time in the past few years that Democrats have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum.\n\nThe party's legislators took off for to Washington DC in 2021 in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to block the passage of new election rules.\n\nTexas Democrats also left for Oklahoma in 2003 in a bid to stop redistricting that Republicans eventually managed to get approved.\n\nStates typically undergo redistricting every 10 years, when voting maps are redrawn to account for population changes.\n\nThe most recent US Census was in 2020. Redrawing district lines in the middle of a decade is unusual.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",
        "source_3": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned House Democrats that they will forfeit their offices if they are not present at the Legislature by 3 p.m. on Monday. The governor stated he plans to remove them from office and fill the vacant seats under powers authorized by the Texas Constitution.\n\n“This truancy ends now,” Governor Abbott (R) said in a Sunday night statement. “The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025.” The governor said he will invoke “Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382  to remove the absent Democrats from their elected office.”\n\nIn that Opinion, the Attorney General considered “whether Texas law allows for a determination that a legislator has vacated office” if they intentionally break quorum. The Attorney General concluded that “whether a specific legislator abandoned his or her office such that a vacancy occurred will be a fact question for a court.”\n\nSunday afternoon, Texas House Democrats fled the state to Illinois to stop the State Legislature from moving forward on plans to redistrict Texas Congressional Districts, Breitbart News’ Elizabeth Weibelreported. Democrat Caucus Chair Gene Wu (D-Houston) said the governor is “using an intentionally racist map to steal the voices of millions of Black and Latino Texans, all to execute a corrupt political deal.” The chairman said House Democrats will “not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that (President Donald Trump) wants to steal.”\n\nThe House Democrats left the state on Sunday and reportedly flew to Illinois.\n\n“Real Texans do not run from a fight. But that’s exactly what most of the Texas House Democrats just did,” Abbott wrote in his letter on Sunday night. “Rather than doing their job and voting on urgent legislation affecting the lives of all Texans, they have fled Texas to deprive the House of the quorum necessary to meet and conduct business.”\n\nThese absences are not merely unintended and unavoidable interruptions in public service, like a sudden illness or a family emergency. Instead, these absences were premeditated for an illegitimate purpose— what one representative called “breaking quorum.” Another previously signaled that Democrats “would have to go by an extreme measure” of a quorum break “to stop these bills from happening.” In other words, Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber’s business.\n\nThat amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\n\n“The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation — not to prevent votes that may not go their way,” he wrote.\n\nThe governor called the question about whether Democrats forfeited their offices by leaving the state “a fact question for a court.”\n\nAbbott Letter About Texas House Democrats Vacating Their Offices\n\nAbbott concluded that “through a quo warranto action, a district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.”\n\n“That empowers me to swiftly fill vacancies under Article III, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution,” Abbott stated.\n\nAbbott further warned that Texas Democrats may have committed felonies in addition to forfeiting their offices.\n\n“Many absentee Democrats are soliciting funds to evade the fines they will incur under House rules,” the governor indicated. “Any Democrat who ‘solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept’ such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws.” He added that any person who provides such funds could also be guilty of bribery.\n\nChairman Wu made just such a solicitation Sunday night when he posted on X, “Please support our efforts. Donate to @TexasHDC!”\n\n“It seems to me that the only way some of the fleeing Democrats can avoid bribery charges is to not break quorum,” Abbottwrotein a social media post on Sunday.\n\n“I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.” Abbott’s letter concluded.\n\nBob Priceis the Breitbart Texas-Border team’s associate editor and senior news contributor.
