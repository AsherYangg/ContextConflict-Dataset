        "source_1": "Iran’s foreign minister says Tehran has no limits in defending its territorial integrity after Israeli strikes kill four.\n\nVideo shows Iranian air defence systems activate during Israeli attack\n\nIran has “no limits” in defending its territorial integrity, according to its foreign minister, as the country’s state media reported on Saturday that predawn Israeli air strikes targeting military bases killed at least four military personnel and damaged radar systems.\n\n“I think we’ve shown that our determination to defend ourselves knows no limits,” Abbas Araghchi said in an interview with the official website of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nEarlier, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Iran was “entitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts” after the attacks on its soil raising concerns about further regional escalation.\n\nThe Israeli armystruck military sitesin Iran after 2am on Saturday (22:30 GMT on Friday) in response to what it said were months of attacks by “Iran and its proxies” in the region.\n\nHours later the Israeli military said it had “completed” the strikes and “achieved its objectives”. It warned Tehran against any retaliation.\n\nIran’s air defence headquarters, in a statement, confirmed that bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran were hit but the attacks were “successfully countered”.\n\nIn a statement read out on state television, the country’s military said only radar systems were damaged in the predawn strikes. “Thanks to the timely performance of the country’s air defences, the attacks caused limited damage and a few radar systems were damaged,” the armed forces general staff said. The Iranian army earlier said two soldiers were killed in theattacks.\n\nThere was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit.\n\nReporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said while Israel targeted multiple locations across Iran, including the north, east and south, the main focus of the strikes was the Iranian capital.\n\n“The attacks primarily aimed at Iran’s air defence systems, missile bases and drone facilities,” he added.\n\nIran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) said flights had returned to normal across the country.\n\nNeither Imam Khomeini international airport in Tehran nor other airports were attacked.\n\nEarlier, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a prerecorded video statement, “The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7 … including direct attacks from Iranian soil.”\n\nHe said Israel “has the right and the duty to respond”.\n\nIsrael’s response was long expected after Iran launcheda missile barrageearlier in October, in which about 200 missiles were fired at Israel and one person was killed in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIran said the attack was in retaliation for assaults in recent monthsthat killedleaders of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, Palestinian group Hamas and the Iranian military.\n\nFollowing the Israeli attacks, the United States urged Iran to stop attacking Israel to break the cycle of violence.\n\n“We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation,” US National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told reporters.\n\n“Their response was an exercise in self-defence and specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran’s attack against Israel that targeted Israel’s most populous city,” he added.\n\nStressing that the US did not participate in the operation, he said, “It is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region”.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he hoped that “this is the end.” “It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets,” Biden told reporters.\n\nBut Iran’s mission to the UN on Saturday said Israeli warplanes attacked Iran from Iraqi airspace. “Iraqi airspace is under the occupation, command and control of the US military. Conclusion: The US complicity in this crime is certain,” the Iran UN mission said in a post on X.\n\nSeveral countriescondemned the strikesand called for restraint.\n\nAnalyst Abas Aslani said this was the first time Israel admitted to a direct strike on Iran, with Tehran downplaying the impact and Israel exaggerating its achievements.\n\n“This indicates that … Israel may be encouraged by the US to avoid a full-scale war in the region,” Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, told Al Jazeera from Tehran.\n\n“The initial assessment and the initial reaction here in Tehran indicates that maybe a serious or significant reaction, a direct reaction against Israel, was not as likely.”\n\nHowever, he added that some sort of response from Iran should be expected.\n\nTensions between archrivals Israel and Iran have escalated after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, at least 42,847 people have been killed and 100,544 wounded in Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nFears that Iran and the US would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel’sintensifying assaulton Hezbollah since last month, including air strikes on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and a ground operation.",
        "source_2": "Israel's attack on Iran has been anticipated since the latter launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles on Israel almost a month ago.\n\nIn a statement announcing that the operation was under way on Saturday, Israel's military spokesman said Israel had the \"right and duty\" to respond and that its defensive and offensive capabilities were fully mobilised.\n\nIranian state media has confirmed that explosions have been heard in the west of Tehran.\n\nBut there's no clarity as yet in precisely what the targets have been and whether they have been successfully hit by Israel.\n\nNews sites close to Iran's Revolutionary Guards says that some military bases in the west and south-west of the Iranian capital have been targeted.\n\nThe Syrian state news agency says that Israeli air strikes have also targeted some military sites in central and southern areas of Syria.\n\nThe office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released a picture of him in the operations centre of the military headquarters during the attack.\n\nFor now, at least, Iranian media is  playing down the impact. The true nature of what has happened is only likely to trickle out bit by bit from the Iranian authorities.\n\nIsrael may move more quickly to disclose the details of its attack.  But that may depend on whether or not it plans to carry out another wave.\n\nThe Pentagon has given a briefing that the US was made aware of Israel's plans beforehand and that there was no US involvement in the operation.\n\nThat's significant in Washington's efforts to try to prevent the conflict between Israel and Iran escalating into a confrontation that could move ever closer to all-out war.\n\nThe US will also be waiting for the dust to settle to see if Israel's targets were limited to military targets or went beyond that to include facilities linked to Iran's nuclear programme - which could trigger another major response from Tehran.\n\nFor now - on the scant evidence that is available - Israel may have heeded Washington's warnings and reined in some of its more ambitious plans to cause maximum pain to the Iranian authorities.\n\nIt's now up to the Iranian leadership to decide how to respond.\n\nThe semi-official Tasnim news agency has said there's no doubt Israel will face what it called a \"proportional reaction\".\n\nThe Israeli military has already said that if Iran were to make what it called the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, it would be obligated to retaliate.\n\nIsrael says it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, accusing him of leading a Hamas cell, which he had denied. Israel provided little evidence for the claim.\n\nIsrael said it targeted well known reporter Anas al-Sharif and alleged he was part of Hamas, which Al Jazeera has denied.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".\n\nProtesters call for the release of hostages still being held in Gaza as they voice support for Israel.",
        "source_3": "Israel launched airstrikes at military targets in Iran early Saturday in retaliation for Tehran’sballistic barrageof 200 rockets targeting the Jewish state earlier this month, the Israeli military confirmed.\n\nMultiple explosions were reported near Tehran, Iran’s capital, and the nearby city of Karaj as Israel’s initial strikes appeared to have targeted a weapons depot, along with a barracks or office, senior Arab officials told NBC News.\n\n“It was so loud and the sky became red,” said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named.\n\nAnother Tehran resident said she “woke up to a distant sound of blasts” Saturday morning, adding there was a heavy presence of Islamic Revolutionary Guards in the city on Friday, according to CNN.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forcesfired “precise strikes” on military targets in Iran “in response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel,” IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement.\n\n“Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,” Hagari added.\n\nAs missiles flew through the sky in Iran, Netanyahu was reportedly in a bunker in Tel Aviv’s Kirya military base, according to the prime minister’s office.\n\nIsraeli officials confirmed the Jewish state is focused on striking military targets, with no plans in place to target any Iranian nuclear facilities or oil fields, NBC News reported.\n\n“We’re targeting things that might have threatened us in the past or could do in the future,” the official said.\n\nThe Harris-Biden administration had voiced their opposition to an Israeli strike on Tehran’s nuclear and oil sites, fearing such a move could trigger an all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, around the same time Israel launched its attack on Iran, several military sites in southern and central Syria were hit, leaving Syrian air defenses reportedly intercepting “hostile targets” in the sky near Damascus, according to local media.\n\nSyrian state media, according to the Times of Israel, said the Jewish state was responsible for the attack on its soil. But Israel made no mention of any military action in Syria as of early Saturday.\n\nThe White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out the retaliatory strikes on Iran and President Biden has been briefed on the attack, Fox News reported.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has also been briefed on the situation, according to NBC News.\n\n“We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1,” said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.\n\nThe US is not participating in the military operations against Iran and President Biden is currently in Wilmington, Delaware, and doesn’t intend on convening in the Situation Room, according to reports.\n\nFollowing the early Saturday airstrikes, Iran closed its airspace and the skies over the country, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon were largely devoid of commercial flights, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAbout four hours after announcing the airstrikes, the Israeli military announced the retaliatory attack had concluded.\n\n“I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran’s attacks against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran — thwarting immediate threats to the State of Israel,” Hagari said in a statement.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces had pledgeda “serious and significant”response to Iran’s attack, with Friday night’s strike serving as a rare and open direct assault on the Islamic Republic.\n\nIran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Oct. 1 in direct response to the recent assassinations of Hezbollah founderHassan Nasrallah, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and an Iranian general.\n\nDespite the extent of the attack on Tel Aviv and other Israeli population centers, many missiles were intercepted before they could cause any serious harm.\n\nIn the wake of Iran’s ballistic missile barrage, Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahudeclared Israel would respond with its own retaliatory attack.\n\nUS officials, who backed Israel’s right to respond to Iran’s attack, said America had been advising the Jewish state on how to prepare a “proportionate” response.\n\nIsrael has been at war with the Palestinian terror group Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, and also fending off assaults from the terrorists’ allies such as the Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen and Iran."
