They appear unobstructed in the lead image of the story in print and online.\n\n“This is insane. I hosted this event and [New York] intentionally left me out of their story because it would have undermined their narrative thatMAGAis some racist cult,” Pearsonposted. He noted that rapper Waka Flocka Flame and boxer Gervonta Davis were in attendance. (The story noted that Flame performed.)\n\nThe story in question, which ran under the headline “The Cruel Kids’ Table,” is an inside account of socializing among a reportedly youthful, urban MAGA set throughout Washington, D.C. The story broadly describes the young cohort, noting that “almost everyone is white,” and quotes an attendee from a different party who noted everyone they saw at an inaugural ball was white.\n\nRob Smith, a conservative consultant who was at the event,tweeteda direct challenge to the image of Pearson’s Power 30 awards, writing he “saw MANY other Conservative media influencers who are Black, Latino, Asian, etc.”\n\nNew York Magazine literally cropped all the black people out of this cover photo and then complained that “the entire room is white”https://t.co/gCatY1lZzGpic.twitter.com/VhoaiJhqg1\n\nRadio host Megyn Kelly also attacked the story’s premise, dismissing the photo outrage as an aside. “This pic, cropped as it is or with all shown, reveals a levity, a joy (the real kind not Kamala’s fake thing), a grab-life-by-the-reigns optimism,” shewroteon X. “It shows beautiful winners, basking, and the Left cannot STAND IT.”\n\nA spokesperson for Vox Media,New York Magazine‘s parent company told The Daily Beast: “The magazine’s most recent cover story explores the new class of conservatives taking Washington by storm, through the lens of inauguration weekend. The cover was cropped to the center of a picture that was published in full online, and we believe both the cover and story provide an accurate impression of the weekend.”",

They also didn’t include the fact that @WakaFlocka and @Gervontaa were also there. You don’t hate the liberal media enough,\" conservative influencer CJ Pearson said.\n\nPearson also told Fox News Digital in a statement that the story spoke to a larger explanation as to why \"the majority of the American people don't believe a single thing the media says.\"\n\n\"Last week to celebrate the inauguration of President Trump, I hosted an incredible event to honor the social media influencers that made his victory possible. The NY Mag intentionally excluded me from their coverage-along with every other person of color in attendance- because including us would have directly contradicted their tried and tired narrative that MAGA is some racist cult,\" Pearson said in a statement.\n\nNew York Magazine provided the following statement toFox News Digitalin response: \"The magazine’s most recent cover story explores the new class of conservatives taking Washington by storm, through the lens of inauguration weekend. The cover was cropped to the center of a picture that was published in full online, and we believe both the cover and story provide an accurate impression of the weekend.\"\n\nCANCEL CULTURE BROKE AMERICA'S MORAL COMPASS. HERE'S HOW WE FIND OUR WAY BACK TO SANITY\n\nKai Trump shined on stage wearing a sparkling silver dress at the Liberty Inaugural Ball.(Jim Watson)\n\nOne key distinction Colyar made in the piece was that this new generation of conservatives are not only different from their modern liberal opposition, but from older members of Trump’s base.\n\n\"It’s easy to see the festivities as an obnoxious victory lap of the MAGA coalition, and of course they are. Conservatism — as a cultural force, not just a political condition — is back in a real way for the first time since the 1980s,\" Colyar wrote. \"But here in D.C., among the tourists from Tampa, the donors, and the last politicians Trump whipped into submission, one can also witness the emerging influence of a newer type of conservative.\"\n\nHe added that they \"are not disenfranchised or working class or anti-elite or many of the other adjectives used to describe Trump supporters since 2016. Rather, they are young, imposingly well-connected, urban, and very online. They are rebels once again storming Capitol Hill, though without the pathetic scariness of the January 6 rioters.\"\n\nColyar attested, \"Some are the black sheep at their own family Thanksgivings, yet they project confidence that they’re the relevant ones now. Many are hot enough to be extras in the upcomingAmerican Psychoremake.\"\n\nThe author quoted numerous influencers such asXaviaer DuRousseau,who observed, \"It’s Republican Coachella, and Donald Trump is our Beyoncé.\"\n\nDEMORALIZED DEMOCRATS ADMIT THEY'VE LOST PUBLIC TRUST AS THEY SEEK NEW ANTI-TRUMP STRATEGY\n\nAnother figure the author quoted was a publicist and crisis consultant for conservative podcasters,Mitchell Jackson,who argued, \"MAGA is MTV for Gen Z. This isn’t the fringe. This is youth pop culture. I’ve been saying this for years. Meanwhile, Democrats sound like ’80s Republicans protesting rap songs.\"\n\nWhile the author observed that the new conservative generation is a big tent of \"crypto nerds and influencer girlies and recent MAHA converts and gays of all stripes, plus your standard-fareRogan-listening bros,\"that there is one key idea they orbit. Their most \"visible political stance,\" Colyar argued, \"is a reaction to what it sees as the left’s puritanical obsessions with policing language and talking about identity.\"\n\nIndeed, one key influencer the piece mentioned numerous times wasArynne Wexler,who told the author, \"Full transparency, I think ‘pronouns’ are ‘retarded.’\" She also urged Colyer to tell readers on her behalf, \"Tomorrow, we’re going to have images of them rounding up illegals and deporting them. That’s exciting.\"\n\nOther influencers across the political spectrum responded to the report, arguing it speaks volumes about changing times in the new Trump era.\n\n\"The left being forced to write articles about how the right is culturally ascendant even in elite circles is absolutely delicious,\" conservative columnist Auron MacIntyre wrote.\n\nHe later added, \"The left needed to believe that MAGA was some movement for the chuds in flyover state. Now that has spread to the well turned out and influential the cope will be unreal.\"\n\nConservative digital strategist Greg Price offered a similar comment, \"I love this specular media fail for so many reasons chief among them being it illustrates how the left is so unbelievably defeated, not just politically, but to the point that being conservative is now associated with the cool, fun, attractive, well put together crowd.\"\n\nAlexander Hall is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.
