        "source_1": "Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic images and descriptions of violence.\n\nA CNN investigation into adeadly incidentnear an aid distribution site in southern Gaza on Sunday points to the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as they tried to make their way to the fenced enclosure to get food.\n\nMore than a dozen eyewitnesses, including those wounded in the attack, said Israeli troops shot at crowds in volleys of gunfire that occurred sporadically through the early hours of Sunday morning. TheGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that runs the site, said that Israeli forces were operating in the area during the same period.\n\nMultiple videos geolocated by CNN place the gunfire near a roundabout where hundreds of Palestinians had gathered about half a mile (800 meters) away from the militarized aid site in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah. The designated route to the site along the coast, Al-Rasheed Street, is in an area under the Israeli military’s control and Israeli troops operate at a base nearby.\n\nWeapons experts said the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, as well as images of bullets retrieved from victims, were consistent with machine guns used by the Israeli military that can be mounted on tanks. Multiple eyewitnesses said that they saw gunfire emanating from Israeli tanks nearby.\n\nNone of the videos definitively show who fired shots outside of the aid camp. However, CNN’s review of audiovisual material sheds fresh light on how the pursuit of aid turned chaotic and then dangerous, on the actions of Israeli forces and the consequences of the new aid mechanism, which has been mired incontroversy.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially said on Sunday that its forces did not fire at civilians “while they were near or within the aid site.” An Israeli military source later acknowledged that troops had fired “warning shots” at suspects about 1 kilometer (1,093 yards) away.\n\nThe Israeli military declined to answer questions about CNN’s findings.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said the military investigated and found its troops played no role in any mass casualty event. Defrin said: “This week, it was claimed that the IDF fired at civilians in an aid distribution area. This report is entirely false and echoes the propaganda of the terrorist organization Hamas… Regarding the incident on Sunday – it simply didn’t happen!”\n\nDefrin also suggested casualty figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry were inflated, but did not elaborate as to how many people the military believed had been killed or injured.\n\nSunday’s mass shooting, which the Palestinian health ministry said killed at least 31 Palestinians and injured dozens, was the deadliest incident involving aid distribution in recent months. It comes amid warnings from the United Nations that the new aid distribution mechanism has become a“death trap”for desperate people seeking food in the strip.\n\nThousands ofstarving Palestinianshad gathered in the sandy bulldozed area near the GHF-run site before the gates opened on Sunday, braving chaotic scenes when gunfire struck the crowd.\n\n“No one move, stay in your place… no one move!” one Palestinian man is heard yelling in a series of videos posted to TikTok on Sunday, filmed along the coast where crowds had gathered near the aid site.\n\nThe videos – reviewed and geolocated by CNN – capture Palestinians taking cover amid repeated bursts of gunfire, and what appear to be two explosive munitions seen landing next to the crowd.\n\nMohammed Saqer, 43, told CNN in an interview that he only narrowly escaped death, watching people around him get shot in the head as he crouched on the ground, hoping to survive long enough to reach the site run by GHF and get food for his family.\n\nAfter the US-backed private foundation finally opened the site at 5:00 a.m., witnesses said the Israeli military’s gunfire continued nearby. Surveillance footage shared by GHF shows crowds of onrushing Palestinians scrambling to reach the limited boxes of food as tracer fire explodes into the night sky in the distance.\n\nBy sunrise, the extent of the catastrophe was undeniable. Videos captured bloodied bodies of Palestinians scattered across the sands, roughly a half mile from the food distribution center.\n\nSimilar deadly incidents on Monday andTuesdaynear the same site have raised further questions about whether the militarized aid initiative backed by the US and approved by Israel can deliver food supplies safely. In the subsequent episodes, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli troops had fired warning shots in the area. GHF said none of the shootings occurred within or adjacent to their distribution sites, adding that the location of the shootings was “an area well beyond our secure distribution site.”\n\nFor Saqer, who said he managed to finally reach the aid site and escaped with whatever he could carry, the harrowing night still weighs heavily on him.\n\n“We survived a night that was worse than we could imagine,” he said. “The reality for people was one of death and hunger searching for food.”\n\nWhen GHF announced its distribution plans for Sunday, the instructions were direct: only one aid site would be open starting at 5:00 a.m., and the IDF would be present in the area to secure passage on a designated route.\n\nIt also warned – albeit after gunfire reportedly already erupted – that the Israeli military would be “active” in the area ahead of the site’s opening.\n\n“Using the passage before 5:00 a.m. is prohibited, as we were informed by the military that it will be active in the area before and after the specified safe hours,” the GHF said in a release on Facebook at 4 a.m. “We remind all residents to stay on the road — straying from it poses a significant danger.”\n\nHaving endured an 11-week Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid, thousands of desperate Palestinians began making their way down Al-Rasheed Street in hopes of being among the first to reach the aid site – the only one operating in all of Gaza that day – before the limited supplies ran out.\n\nAs people attempted to slowly advance to the aid site from the Al-Alam roundabout, more than a dozen witnesses interviewed by CNN described the IDF opening volleys of intense fire on the crowd starting as early as 3:30 a.m.\n\n“I could hear the screams of young people and others from their injuries,” Saqer said. “In front of me were four young men with direct injuries to the head… there was a person next to me who was injured by a bullet in his eye.”\n\nHe and others said a quadcopter drone appeared above the crowd, with the voice on its speaker telling people to turn around. But amid the warning, gunfire crackled all around them.\n\n“Even retreating was almost impossible, and everyone was lying on the ground unable to lift their heads because if you lifted your head, you would get shot.”\n\nAs the chaos unfolded near the Al-Alam area, the GHF aid site officially opened at 5:00 a.m. Security video of the location released by the organization, which was labeled as beginning at 5:02 a.m., shows crowds of Palestinians running into the fenced distribution center.\n\nThree minutes later, in the background of the video, bursts of tracer gunfire are seen overhead, which forensics experts told CNN appear to be outgoing from an area near the distribution site. In the video, which has no audio, crowds can be seen running in another direction nearby. It is unclear whether they are running from gunfire.\n\nAround the same time back in the Al-Alam area approximately 800 meters (874 yards) away, 30-year-old Ameen Khalifa was filming as he took cover. Several videos shared on TikTok by Khalifa show groups of Palestinians lying flat on the ground and taking cover from ongoing bursts of automatic gunfire. CNN geolocated the video to the area using visible spotlights at the Egyptian border and the unfinished hospital that became an Israeli military base.\n\nRobert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined the footage for CNN and said that the bursts of gunfire were at a rate of 15 and 16 shots per second (or 900 and 960 per minute), fired from a distance of about a quarter of a mile (450 meters).\n\nBased on the erratic nature of the sound, Maher said that the shots seemed to be spread out, fired repeatedly in one direction. “Since the cracks are irregular, it seems more like the gunfire was being sprayed over the area.”\n\nTrevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, said the rate of fire was consistent with the FN MAG, a heavily-used machine gun in the Israeli military’s arsenal. The FN MAG is commonly equipped on the IDF’s Merkava tanks, which several eyewitnesses said they saw open fire on the crowds.\n\nBall told CNN he could not confirm the specific weaponry used, or who fired it, but the rate of fire, he said, indicated it wasn’t consistent with machine guns used by Hamas.\n\nBall also said the tracer fire – ammunition containing a pyrotechnic charge illuminating its trajectory – seen in the GHF’s footage is consistent with the use of machine guns. “Typically belt fed machine guns have tracer rounds inserted every few rounds. So while only 3 tracers are visible in the video, more rounds were fired.”\n\nKhalifa, who loved sports and bodybuilding, survived the harrowing night on Sunday only to be shot and killed by a drone two days later while heading to the same aid site to look for food, one of his close friends told CNN.\n\nBy daylight, video footage reviewed by CNN captured the dire scene near the coast, with several bodies strewn in the sand. The Palestinian health ministry said that more than 200 casualties reached hospitals, including dozens with serious injuries. It added that all of those killed had been shot in the head or chest.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said that its nearby field hospital was overwhelmed by patients, describing the carnage as the “highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident” since it opened over a year ago. Other dead and wounded were taken to Nasser Hospital.\n\n“It’s difficult to describe what we saw with the young and the old, there was severe injuries to the head, severe injuries to the lung,” recalled Dr. Ahmad Abou-Sweid, an Australian working at the Nasser medical complex.\n\n“There was a heavy proportion of head-targeted injuries from bullet wounds.”\n\nDoctors working at Nasser Hospital shared photos with CNN of the bullets retrieved from patients injured and killed in the attack, which weapons experts say appear to match the type of ammunition used in the Israeli military’s machine guns. “This bullet is consistent with the NATO standard 7.62mm M80, which would be fired by IDF 7.62x51mm weapons, including the Negev 7.62 and FN MAG,” Ball said of one of the images.\n\nGHF, which runs the site, insisted: “There was no gunfire in the (distribution) center and also not in the surrounding area.”\n\n“All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”\n\nThe IDF said allegations that Israeli soldiers fired on Gazans near or within the aid distribution site were “false reports.” It added: “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.”\n\nAn Israeli military source told CNN that IDF troops did fire warning shots towards suspects approaching their position approximately a kilometer (1,100 yards) away from the aid distribution site in an incident that happened several hours before the site opened.\n\nIhab Musleh told CNN he had taken his two young sons along to the aid distribution center. When he told them to stay put at a nearby hill as he went inside the site, he heard more gunfire and rushed back out.\n\nYazeed, 13, was shot in the stomach by gunfire from an Israeli tank and survived his injuries, according to his dad.\n\n“He was waving his hands towards the tank and within seconds, he was hit with gunfire and fell to the ground,” Musleh said, speaking to CNN from the hospital where his son was being treated.\n\nOther witnesses told CNN they were either injured or saw intense gunfire in the area after the aid site opened.\n\nMohammad Abu Rezeq was shot in the stomach upon arriving at Al-Alam where he said Israeli forces were deliberately targeting the crowd.\n\n“I have seen a lot of soldiers in this war. When they want to clear an area or warn you, they shoot around you. But yesterday, they were shooting to kill us,” Abu Rezeq said.\n\nCNN asked the IDF about the claim from witnesses that its troops were firing directly at crowds, shooting to kill, but it gave no further comment beyond its published statement.\n\nThe chaos in the early hours of Sunday morning was not an isolated incident. In consecutive days since, Palestinians attempting to reach the GHF’s aid distribution sites have come under fire by the Israeli military.\n\nAfter the intense gunfire near the Al-Alam roundabout on Sunday, GHF’s Facebook posts included updated maps of the safe route for the following days. The new maps included a large, red stop sign at Al-Alam.\n\nOn Tuesday, nearly 30 people were killed and dozens wounded while making their way to the aid sites in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and Nasser Hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military said that its forces opened fire multiple times after identifying “several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes.”\n\n“The troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops,” the IDF said in a statement, adding they were looking into reports of casualties.\n\nWhile the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots in the area three days in a row, posts from GHF’s Facebook page show the organization works in close coordination with the IDF to establish safe, defined routes.\n\nGHF was set up amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting from sales, though Israel hasn’t presented any evidence publicly to back up the claim.\n\nUN aid groups, such as UNRWA, typically check identification and rely on a database of registered families when distributing aid.\n\nBut GHF isnot screening Palestiniansat aid distribution sites, despite Israeli officials saying that additional security measures were a core reason for the creation of the new program.\n\nUN aid agencies have criticized GHF’s aid mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles andraises the risksfor Palestinians.\n\nCriticism has been mountingagainst both Israeland GHF afterchaos broke out last weekwhen tens of thousands of starving Palestinians arrived at two new food distribution sites.\n\nThe UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, was scathing in his assessment to the UN Security Council late last month.\n\n“It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet,” he said.\n\n“It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”\n\nVideo edited by Oscar Featherstone in London. Tareq Al Hilou in Gaza contributed to this report.\n\nThe IDF has not directly responded to this article. But it later released to the media a recording of what it said was a Gaza resident speaking to an official at COGAT, the Israeli agency that coordinates the passage of aid into the territory. According to the IDF, the resident blames Hamas for preventing residents receiving aid, including by “firing at IDF troops near distribution points and spreading false claims about mass casualties near those areas.” CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the recording nor the identity of those speaking.",
        "source_2": "Multiple news outlets reported that Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians near an aid site in Gaza, citing the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has denied the allegations.\n\nSome news organizations issued corrections after their initial coverage of the Gaza incidents, including the Washington Post. Others, such as the BBC, stood by their reporting.\n\nThe White House criticized media handling of the incident, and accused some in the media of relying too heavily on Hamas-sourced information.\n\nWidely circulated reports on Tuesday, June 3, from several news outlets claimed that Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinians near an aid distribution site in Gaza. That incident followed a series of similar attacks at aid centers over the previous few days. Together, those reports generated international concern and calls from the United Nations to launch a formal investigation.\n\nNow, The Washington Post is issuing corrections after omitting Israel’s initial denial of some of those incidents. Israel now says that it fired upon individuals who it believed were approaching an IDF position in a threatening manner.\n\nEarly media headlines included phrases such as “Israeli forces in Gaza kill dozens of Palestinians seeking aid” and “At least 27 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire.” The reports cited the Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas.\n\nHealth researchers in the U.K. said in January that the Hamas-run ministry had actually beenundercounting deaths in Gaza by about 41%, whereas earlier estimates held that the ministry was undercounting mortalities by only 10%. An unknown number of bodies are believed to be buried under rubble, and that is a primary factor in the disagreement.\n\nIsraeli officialsinitially refutedthe accusation that they fired on Palestinian civilians, calling it a “Hamas lie” and accusing international media of amplifying propaganda without proper verification. More recently, the IDF has admitted that it fired upon some individuals in the crowd, and said that there would be an investigation of those allegations.\n\nThe Washington Postaltered its original headline,which read, “Israeli troops kill over 30 near U.S. aid site in Gaza, health officials say.” The outlet changed it to “More than 30 killed by gunfire near U.S. aid site in Gaza,” removing attribution of blame to Israel following Israel’s denial.\n\n“The Post didn’t give proper weight to Israel’s denial and gave improper certitude about what was known about any Israeli role in the shootings,”The Post wrote in a statement on X.“The early versions fell short of Post standards of fairness and should not have been published in that form.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavittaddressed the incident Tuesday,criticizing news coverage of the event.\n\n“Unfortunately, unlike some in the media, we don’t take the word of Hamas with total truth,” Leavitt said. “We like to look into it when they speak — unlike the BBC who had multiple headlines they wrote: ‘Israeli tank kills 26,’ ‘Israeli tank kills 21,’ ‘Israeli gunfire kills 31,’ ‘Red Cross says 21 people were killed in an aid incident’ — and then, oh wait, they had to correct and take down their entire story because they couldn’t confirm anything.”\n\nIsraeldoes not permit journaliststo enter Gaza, making it difficult for most news organizations to independently confirm any allegations.\n\nThe BBC has denied that it removed or corrected any of its reporting.In a statement,the outlet said: “The claim the BBC took down a story after reviewing footage is completely wrong. We did not remove any story and we stand by our journalism. It is vital to bring people the truth about what is happening in Gaza.”\n\nThe Associated Press, Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross also stood by those reports.\n\nThe attack on Tuesday marks the third alleged Israeli attack in or around food distribution centers over a period of four days. The latest report followed two similar incidents onSundayandMonday, where witnesses and officials said that Israeli troops opened fire near aid centers.\n\nOn Monday,CNN wrote that dozens of Palestinians were shot deadby the Israeli military near an aid distribution site, citing Palestinian officials, doctors and eyewitnesses. The IDF initially denied that Israeli troops fired “within or near” the site, but a spokesperson later acknowledged thatthey did, stating that they “didn’t hit that many people as far as we understand [and] we will continue to investigate.”\n\nThe conflicting reports on the aid distribution center attacks reflect a much earlier incident regarding a 2023 attack on al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Initial reports of hundreds of people dying in an explosion there, also citing the Gaza Health Ministry, blamed an Israeli airstrike. Later assessments, including from U.S. intelligence agencies, found it was more likely caused by a misfired rocket launched by a Palestinian militia group.\n\nThat hospital storyled to corrections from The New York Times,though the BBC, which first reported the incident, defended its journalism. Other outlets have continued to attribute blame to Israel, while others retracted or corrected those allegations.\n\nThe BBC said at the time that it properly attributed the original claim to the Gaza Health Ministry and later updated the report with Israel’s denial.\n\nIDF forces recentlybombed the same hospitalon April 13, 2025.\n\n“Anyone watching, listening to or reading it can see we have set out both sides’ competing claims about the attack, clearly showing who is saying them, and what we do or don’t know,” the BBC said in a statement.\n\nIT’S A REPORT THAT WAS WIDELY CIRCULATED ON TUESDAY FROM NEWS OUTLETS WITH A LEFT POLITICAL BIAS.\n\nHEADLINES READ “ISRAELI FORCES IN GAZA KILL DOZENS OF PALESTINIANS SEEKING AID.”\n\nALL OF THE STORIES – CITE “GAZA’S HEALTH MINISTRY” –\n\nHAMAS’ CLAIM OF ISRAEL KILLING DOZENS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE –\n\nWAS **REFUTED BY ISRAELI OFFICIALS – CALLING IT A “HAMAS LIE” THAT WAS SUCCESSFULLY ECHOED AS PROPAGANDA BY INTERNATIONAL MEDIA.\n\nCHANGING ITS HEADLINE FROM “ISRAELI TROOPS KILL OVER 30 NEAR U.S. AID SITE IN GAZA” TO “MORE THAN 30 KILLED BY GUNFIRE NEAR U.S. AID SITE IN GAZA” –\n\nTHE WASHINGTON POST’S CORRECTION COMES AFTER THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES RELEASED THIS VIDEO REGARDING REPORTS OF SHOOTINGS NEAR HUMANITARIAN AID SITES.\n\n“Hamas has responded to this aid initiative with violence in attempts to sabotage the delivery of aid and even send gunmen to fire at civilians in the aid distribution centers.”\n\n“The IDF did not fire at civilians within the aid centers. Any claims to the contrary are entirely false, harm our forces, and serve Hamas propaganda. Hamas is spreading false information that is unfortunately being echoed by the media without any verification.”\n\nTHE WASHINGTON POST WROTE ON X ABOUT THE CORRECTION –\n\nSAYING “The Post didn’t give proper weight to Israel’s denial and gave improper certitude about what was known about any Israeli role in the shootings. The early versions fell short of Post standards of fairness and should not have been published in that form.”\n\nWHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY KAROLINE LEAVITT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE GAZA INCIDENT ON TUESDAY.\n\n“Unfortunately, unlike some in the media, we don’t take the word of hamas with total truth, we like to look into it when they speak unlike the BBC who had multiple headlines they wrote “israeli tank kills 26, israli thank kills 21, isreali gunfire kills 31, red cross says 21 people were killed in an aid incident and then oh wait they had to correct and take down their entire story because they couldn’t confirm anything.”\n\nBUT THE BBC IS STANDING BY ITS ORIGINAL REPORT AND ASSESSMENT –\n\nRELEASING ITS OWN STATEMENT SAYING “The claim the BBC took down a story after reviewing footage is completely wrong. We did not remove any story and we stand by our journalism. It is vital to bring people the truth about what is happening in Gaza.”\n\nTHIS LATEST REPORT OF A SHOOTING THAT KILLED AROUND 30 PEOPLE –\n\nFOLLOWED OTHER SIMILAR REPORTS FROM SUNDAY **AND MONDAY –\n\nTHAT PALESTINIANS WERE DYING IN TWO OTHER REPORTED “SHOOTING INCIDENTS” NEAR FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITES.\n\nDozens of Palestinians were shot dead by the Israeli military near an aid distribution site in Gaza on Sunday according to Palestinian officials and eyewitnesses, with Israel’s military denying that its troops fired “within or near” the aid site.\n\nTHIS IS FAR FROM THE FIRST TIME THE HAMAS RUN HEALTH MINISTRY AND ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES HAVE SHARED DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WAR EVENTS IN GAZA.\n\nBUT ITS THE THIRD TIME IN FOUR DAYS THAT HAMAS IS BLAMING ISRAEL FOR ALLEGED SHOOTING INCIDENTS AT AID CENTERS.\n\nTHIS STORY – IS REMINISCENT OF A MAJOR STORY THAT BROKE NEAR THE START OF THE WAR THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER.\n\n10 DAYS AFTER THE HAMAS TERROR ATTACK THAT STARTED THE WAR –\n\nAN EXPLOSION AT A GAZA HOSPITAL RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES.\n\nINITIAL HEADLINES SUGGESTED AN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE WAS TO BLAME AS NEWS OUTLETS CITED THE GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY.\n\nUNTIL LATER ASSESSMENTS – INCLUDING FROM U.S. INTELLIGENCE – REVEALED IT WAS MORE LIKELY CAUSED BY A MISFIRED ROCKET LAUNCHED BY A PALESTINIAN MILITIA GROUP.\n\nTHIS STORY ALSO LED TO RETRACTIONS FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES.\n\nBUT THE BBC – WHICH ALSO FIRST BROKE THE HOSPITAL STRIKE – DEFENDED ITS REPORTING THEN TOO – SAYING IT PROPERLY ATTRIBUTED THE CLAIMS OF AN ISRAELI STRIKE COMING FROM THE GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY – THEN UPDATED THE STORY WITH THE IDF’S STATEMENT REFUTING THE CLAIMS.\n\nAccurate media reporting and transparency are critical during conflicts, as disputed accounts and corrections can shape public perception and international responses to events on the ground.\n\nThe story highlights the importance of media outlets properly attributing claims, issuing corrections and presenting multiple perspectives to maintain journalistic standards and public trust.\n\nCompeting accounts from governmental and militant sources, coupled with official denials, underscore how information warfare and differing narratives can complicate understanding of events in conflict zones.\n\nAllegations of premature or unverified reporting about incidents, especially when sources are in dispute, illustrate how misinformation can influence international opinion and policymaking.\n\nIn its first week, the U.S.-Israeli-backed effort aimed at delivering aid in Gaza has run into obstacles.
