(AP) — A judge on Wednesday released a Palestinian student atColumbia Universitywho ledprotests against Israel’s war in Gazaand was arrested by immigration officials during an interview about finalizing his U.S. citizenship.\n\nImmigration authorities have arrested and detained college students from around the country since the first days of the Trump administration, many of whom participated in campus protests overthe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than52,000 Palestinians.\n\nMohsen Mahdawiis among the first of those students to win his freedom after challenging an arrest. He walked out of a Vermont courthouse Wednesday and led hundreds of supporters in chants including “No fear” and “Free Palestine.” He said people must come together to defend both democracy and humanity.\n\nMohsen Mahdawi, center, looks on during a pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University, Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023, in New York.

And what is going to happen in America is going to affect the rest of the world.”\n\nMahdawi, 34, has been a legal permanent resident for 10 years. He was in a Vermont state prison since April 14. In his release order, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford said Mahdawi has raised a “substantial claim that the government arrested him to stifle speech with which it disagrees.”\n\n“Even if he were a firebrand, his conduct is protected by the First Amendment,” the judge wrote, adding that offending political opponents or alarming the State Department doesn’t make him dangerous enough to justify detention.\n\nThe U.S. government argues they can remove Mahdawi from the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act. That’s because Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosays his presence and activities “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.”\n\nMohsen Mahdawi speaks outside the courthouse after a judge released the Palestinian student activist on Wednesday, April 30, 2025 in Burlington, Vt. (AP Photo/Amanda Swinhart)\n\nA government attorney said Wednesday that Mahdawi is a national security threat, pointing to a 2015 FBI investigation into allegations that he made threatening comments about Jews at a gun shop — but the judge said the FBI appears to have determined those accusations were fabricated.\n\nMahdawi will appear remotely before an immigration judge in Louisiana on Thursday, his lawyers said. The U.S. attorney’s office did not respond to messages seeking comment on whether it will appeal his release.\n\nAccording to a court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in theIsraeli-occupied West Bankand moved to the United States in 2014. He organized campus protests at Columbia until March 2024 and cofounded the school’s Palestinian Student Union withMahmoud Khalil,another Palestinian permanent resident of the U.S. and graduate student whowas arrestedin March.\n\nKhalil has been held for nearly eight weeks in a Louisiana detention center,missing the birth of his first child. An immigration judge ruled that Khalilcan be forced out of the countryas a national security risk.\n\nIn another high-profile case,Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, wasdetained in Marchover what her lawyers say is apparent retaliation for an op-ed piece she co-wrote in the student newspaper.\n\nMore than 1,000 college students nationwide have had theirvisas revokedor their legal status terminated since late March, according toan Associated Press review. The federal government has since announced it will reverse the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges,a government lawyer said Friday.\n\nThe judge referred to the Ozturk case and others like it in his ruling, saying such arrests are reminiscent of nationwide raids targeting suspected anarchists and communists in 1919 and 1920 and deportations during the McCarthy era of the 1950s.\n\n“Security is like liberty in that many are the crimes committed in its name,” he wrote, quoting from a dissent in a 1950 case.\n\nMahdawi’s release allows him to travel outside his home state of Vermont and attend graduation next month in New York. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and planned to begin a master’s degree program there in the fall.\n\nThe Ivy League university has faced criticism from some students for agreeing to implement a host ofpolicy changesdemanded bythe Trump administration. After Mahdawi’s release, school spokesperson Millie Wert said every person in the country deserves due process regardless of their citizenship status.\n\nOutside the Vermont courthouse, Mahdawi directly addressed PresidentDonald Trumpand his Cabinet, saying, “I am not afraid of you.”\n\n“If there is no fear, what is it replaced with?” he said. “Love. Love is our way.”\n\nRamer reported from Concord, New Hampshire. Associated Press writers Kathy McCormack and Kimberlee Kruesi also contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "source_2": "A Columbia University student and Palestinian activist arrested by US immigration authorities has been released from custody, US media reports.\n\nMohsen Mahdawi, who has permanent US residency or \"green card\" status, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) when he turned up at an American citizenship interview in Vermont in mid-April.\n\nMr Mahdawi's legal team petitioned for his release alleging unlawful incarceration.\n\nThe US government says he was undermining US foreign policy. Luna Droubi, one of his lawyers, argued that the arrest was \"in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian\".\n\nVermont District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi from prison on bail on Wednesday, pending the court's ruling on the habeas petition challenging his detention, according to a statement by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is part of his legal representation.\n\nThe judge denied a request from government lawyers to delay his release by seven days.\n\nIn the statement, Ms Droubi said the claims against him are \"baseless\" and a \"disgrace to the US Constitution\". She said she was \"relieved\" that Mr Mahdawi had been released, and vowed to \"keep fighting until Mohsen is free for good\".\n\nTricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, responded after his release, saying \"no judge, not this one or another, is going to stop the Trump Administration from restoring the rule of law to our immigration system\".\n\nMr Mahdawi thanked supporters outside the courtroom, saying, \"We are pro-peace and anti-war\".\n\n\"To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering; and I see freedom and it is very very soon.\"\n\nOne day before his arrest, Mr Mahdawi had told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he believed the citizenship interview could be a setup.\n\n\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mr Mahdawi said. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"\n\nSeveral prominent politicians, including independent Senator Bernie Sanders who represents Vermont, have spoken out in support of Mr Mahdawi and called for his release.\n\nUS authorities have detained multiple students and graduates involved in the protest movement against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",
        "source_3": "A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, aColumbia Universitystudent from the West Bank, after Mahdawi spent more than two weeks in immigration detention following his abrupt arrest during a naturalization interview.\n\nThe 34-year-old permanent U.S. resident was detained by armed Department of Homeland Security agents on April 14 while seeking U.S. citizenship in Vermont. Mahdawi has been held since then at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, and his case has drawn national attention over theTrump administration’s targeting of pro-Palestinian student activists.\n\n“The two weeks of detention so far demonstrate great harm to a person who has been charged with no crime,” said U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, according to ABC News. “Mr. Mahdawi, I will order you released.”\n\nCrawford’s order allows Mahdawi to be released on bail, pending the final outcome of his case in federal court.\n\nThe government cited national security concerns in seeking to keep him in custody. In a statement to theWashington Examiner, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin vowed that the administration is “committed to restoring the rule of law to our immigration system.”\n\n“No judge, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,” McLaughlin said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio justified the arrest in a DHS notice, stating Mahdawi’s “presence and activities” in the United States would pose “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”\n\nProsecutors also alleged Mahdawi had expressed support for antisemitic violence and had “an interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose,” according to sealed government filings seen by NBC.\n\nOriginally from the al Fara’a refugee camp in the West Bank, Mahdawi immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and began studying at Columbia in 2021.\n\n“I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said outside the courtroom after his release,accordingto NBC News.\n\nThe Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement actions against Middle Eastern students tied to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Mahdawi is the second Columbia student in recent weeks to face detention.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led protests against the war in Gaza, wasarrestedat his New York apartment on March 8. A judge ruled on April 11 that Khalil can be deported, though he remains in custody while appealing the decision.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION DIDN’T HAVE ARREST WARRANT FOR MAHMOUD KHALIL, CITING ‘FLIGHT RISK’\n\nThe Trump administration contends it is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to study in the country and that aligning with groups such as Hamas, the foreign terrorist organization that launched a deadly assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, should forfeit that privilege.\n\n“When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,” McLaughlin said."
