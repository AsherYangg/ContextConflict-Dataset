        "source_1": "In his first term as president,Donald Trumpbuilt a conservative 6-3 supermajority on theSupreme Court. Ever since, the nation’s highest court has repeatedly issued increasingly extreme, far-right decisions on topics ofabortion, race, theenvironment,corruption, and much more.\n\nThe Supreme Court has eliminatedfederal protections for abortion rights; limited the federal government’s ability toregulate carbon emissions,protect Americans’ drinking water, andlimit ozone pollution; gutted federal agencies’ ability to implement regulations generally;opened up long-standing regulationsto new challenges; made it easier for statesto enact racial gerrymanders; eliminatedcollege affirmative action policies; found businessescan discriminate against LGBTQ+ customers; permitted public school employees tolead students in prayer; decided that companiescan pay public officials gratuities, or thank-you payments, for corrupt contracting decisions; andbroadly shielded Trump from criminal prosecutionfor any so-called official acts he committed as president.\n\nTrump is so proud of the conservatives on the court that hefrequentlypraisedthe justices, individually by name, at 2024 campaign events — thanking them for their “courage” in deciding to overturnRoe v. Wadeso states could ban abortion. At a September rally, Trump called the conservative justices “very brave” andargued that “people should be put in jail”for criticizing them.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s chief justice,John Roberts, is now echoing Trump’s demand that people stop criticizing him, his colleagues, and other federal jurists — while continuing to pretend that judges are not political.\n\nIn his annual end-of-yearreport, issued on Tuesday, Robertswrotethat public officials (read: Democrats) “regrettably have engaged in recent attempts to intimidate judges — for example, suggesting political bias in the judge’s adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.” Roberts added, “Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others.”Editor’s picksThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So FarThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All TimeThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\nThe idea that Democrats have sought to intimidate the justices is laughable — save for a few lonely voices, they have said shockingly little and done nothing to attempt to rein in the court’s ongoing right-wing rampage. While Democrats have called out conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito for failing to disclose, in apparent violation of federal ethics rules, luxury travel provided by right-wing billionaires, they ultimately did nothing about that either.\n\nRoberts — whoreportedly drovethe court’s far-reaching decision in the Trump immunity case — has long pretended to be an apolitical actor, who would simply call“balls and strikes”as a jurist.\n\nIt’s a ridiculous notion: Supreme Court justices — and federal judges generally — are political appointees. But since he was appointed by George W. Bush and confirmed in 2005, Roberts has overseen thecourt’s dramatic right-wing shift— which has been further turbocharged by Trump’s appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.

No one should pretend otherwise.",
        "source_2": "At the end of an eventful year at the Supreme Court that included a ruling giving former President Donald Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution for his conduct while in office, reporting that controversial flags had flown at the homes of Justice Samuel Alito, and an ethics inquiry from Senate Democrats that found more gift trips that Justice Clarence Thomas had failed to disclose, Chief Justice John Roberts’annual report, released on Tuesday evening, focused on what he sees as the threats to judicial independence.\n\nOne of those threats, Roberts wrote, is disinformation from abroad fomented by foreign countries. Although Roberts did not mention any of the “hostile foreign state actors” responsible for such disinformation by name, the justices will hear oral arguments next week in a challenge to a federal law that would require social media giant TikTok to shut down in the United States unless its parent company can sell it off by Jan. 19. A federal appeals court upheld the law earlier this month, calling it part of “a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the People’s Republic of China.” Roberts’ discussion of disinformation in his report seemed to suggest that he may be sympathetic to the TikTok ban.\n\nThe chief justice traditionally releases his year-end report on the federal judiciary every year on New Year’s Eve. Roberts’s2023 reportdiscussed the legal profession and the role of artificial intelligence. His2022 report, in the aftermath of the court’s decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, stressed the importance of judicial security.\n\nThis year’s report comes in the wake of mounting criticism of the court and the justices’ decision in June overturning the longstandingChevrondoctrine, which instructed courts to generally defer to a federal agency’s interpretation of the statutes that it administers. Quoting his predecessor, the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Roberts characterized the United States’s independent federal judiciary as “one of the ‘crown jewels of our system of government” – and essential to the rule of law.\n\nBut “four areas of illegitimate activity” pose a danger to that independence, Roberts wrote on Tuesday. There has “been a significant uptick in” threats directed at judges, he noted, requiring the commitment of “significant additional resources” to protect judges and investigate and prosecute threats against them.\n\nA bill passed earlier this month to avert a government shutdown included more than $25 million in funding for security at the justices’ homes. A California man, Nicholas Roske, is scheduled to stand trial in Maryland next year on charges that he attempted to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022.\n\nEfforts to intimidate judges – whether by “activist groups” or public officials – can undermine independence, Roberts continued. Roberts cautioned that critics of the judiciary “should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others.”\n\nRoberts also cited disinformation as a threat to judicial independence, observing that “distortion of the factual or legal basis for a ruling can undermine confidence in the court system.” The judicial branch, Roberts added, “is peculiarly ill-suited to combat this problem, because judges typically speak only through their decisions.” (The Supreme Court does not make audio of its opinion announcements, at which the justices normally read summaries of their written opinions, available for several months after the opinions are released.)\n\nRoberts pointed to the influence of “hostile foreign state actors” as another part of that potential threat. Such actors, he said, could “feed false information into the marketplace of ideas” or “steal information.” Defending the TikTok ban, the Biden administration told the court on Dec. 27 that TikTok “collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans, which” China “could use for espionage or blackmail,” and that China could “covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States — by, for example, sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.”\n\nFinally, Roberts concluded, “judicial independence is undermined unless the other branches are firm in their responsibility to enforce the court’s decrees.” Roberts harkened back to the 1950s and 1960s, when federal judges and the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations stood together when state governors tried to defy court orders to desegregate schools. Since then, he said, the United States has “avoided the standoffs,” but recently “elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings. These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be rejected,” he wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court will be back in the spotlight early in the new year, when it hears arguments on Jan. 10 in the TikTok case.\n\nThis article wasoriginally published at Howe on the Court.",
        "source_3": "In his annual year-end report,Supreme CourtChief JusticeJohn Robertsexpressed disdain for public officials who have tried to coerce and intimidate judges over the last year.\n\nAttempts to go beyond standard criticism of judges as they weigh in on important cases, to outright intimidation or calls to ignore their decisions, are examples of “illegitimate activity,” Roberts said in his annual report released every year on New Year’s Eve.\n\n“Attempts to intimidate judges for their rulings in cases are inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed,” Roberts wrote in the 15-pagereport. “Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others.”\n\nRoberts homed in on four points that members of the Supreme Court and lower-level courts faced this year. These areas of concern were violence, intimidation, disinformation, and threats to defy court judgments.\n\nThe report comes after a summer of opposition against the Supreme Court following attacks on Republican-appointed Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Thomas has faced multiple accusations of receiving lavish gifts from a wealthy donor and not properly claiming them. Alito, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, has also been accused of having inappropriate relationships with wealthy donors and was the target of an attack for having two flags that were flown outside his houses.\n\nWhile Roberts didn’t mention any actors by name, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) did threaten to file articles of impeachment against Alito and Thomas earlier this year.\n\n“Within the past year we also have seen the need for state and federal bar associations to come to the defense of a federal district judge whose decisions in a high-profile case prompted an elected officialto call for her impeachment,” Roberts wrote. “Attempts to intimidate judges for their rulings in cases are inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed.”\n\nRoberts noted that threats against justices and judges went beyond just being political.\n\n“Today, in the computer era, intimidation can take different forms,” Roberts wrote. “Disappointed litigants rage at judicial decisions on the Internet, urging readers to send a message to the judge. They falsely claim that the judge had it in for them because of the judge’s race, gender, or ethnicity — or the political party of the President who appointed the judge. Some of these messages promote violence — for example, setting fire to or blowing up the courthouse where the target works.”\n\nDoxxing was another serious problem. Just two years ago, an armed man was arrested near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s residence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRoberts ended the report with a reminder to all judges of the important role they have in preserving the public’s trust in the justice system.\n\n“We do so by confining ourselves to live ‘cases or controversies’ and maintaining a healthy respect for the work of elected officials on behalf of the people they represent,” Roberts wrote. “I am confident that the judges in Article III and the corresponding officials in the other branches will faithfully discharge their duties with an eye toward achieving the ‘successful cooperation’ essential to our Nation’s continued success.”"
