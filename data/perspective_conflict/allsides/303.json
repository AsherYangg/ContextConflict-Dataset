        "source_1": "WASHINGTON − A call betweenPresident Donald Trumpand Russian leaderVladimir Putinended with a limited agreement for Russia and Ukraine to cease attacks on energy infrastructure but stopped short of a U.S. proposal for a temporary truce.\n\nThe United States said Russia had agreed to an energy and infrastructure ceasefire. After Moscow and Kyiv agree to stop hitting each other's power plants and electric grids, negotiators would move on to a potential halt in fighting on the Black Sea − and then to a full ceasefire and peace agreement inthe 3-year-old Ukraine war, a White House statement said.\n\nTrumpsaidon social mediathe talk ended \"with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine. ...\n\n\"That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!\"\n\nThe White House said that discussions would begin immediately in the Middle East.\n\nTrump's team has been meeting representatives from Moscow and Kyiv separately to nail down a ceasefire and a framework for a deal to end the war. Trump promised a rapid end to the conflict during the 2024 campaign, but he has has been unable to bring about a resolution so far.\n\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow last week. Secretary of StateMarco Rubiospoke on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The interactions followed in-person talks with top Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia and set the stage for Tuesday's call between Putin and Trump.\n\nThey talked for at least an hour and a half, the White House indicated. Officials declined to say how much longer the leaders spoke.\n\nA readout from the White House provided scant details on what was discussed. A Kremlin statement said Trump proposed a 30-day halt on energy infrastructure attacks and Putin immediately gave his military the order. Russia also said a prisoner exchange would happen Wednesday with each side releasing 175 people. An additional 23 severely injured Ukrainian troops would also be transferred, the Kremlin said.\n\nTrump also backed a Putin proposal for U.S.-Russia hockey matches, according to the Kremlin. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Monday, the president said he intended to lay the groundwork for a peace deal and implore Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege from Russian forces.\n\n\"We had to get Ukraine to do the right thing. It was not an easy situation,\" Trump said. \"But I think they're doing the right thing right now. And we're trying to get a peace agreement done.\"\n\nLast week the United States restored intelligence sharing with Ukraine and lifted a pause on military assistance, as officials awaited Russia's response to the temporary truce.\n\nUkraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire on the condition that Russia also accepted the terms of the agreement. That proposal called for a temporary freeze to the conflict and a halt to an intense aerial battle between the two nations.\n\nDisputed territorycould be monitoredduring that time with satellites, intelligence and drones.\n\nUkrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhad previously pushed for a truce to bar the use of missiles, long-range drones and attacks on civilian and energy infrastructure. He also offered to halt attacks on Russian ships.\n\nZelenskyy's government has also pushed for Russia to agree toa prisoner exchange, the release of detained civilians and the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children.\n\nUkraine backers immediately slammed the scaled-back agreement as one that would primarily benefit Russia.\n\nThe agreement would keep Ukraine from striking Russia's oil refineries, said Edward Fishman, the former Russia sanctions lead at the State Department in the Obama administration..\n\n\"It's a big cash cow for the Kremlin, selling petroleum products like gasoline,\" said Fishman, the author of \"Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.\"\n\nAt the same time, Fishman said, the Ukrainians don't want to be seen as an impediment to a ceasefire. \"They're in a tough spot.\"\n\nPutin was likely to pull back from attacks on energy infrastructure in warmer weather anyway, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute.\n\n\"Recognizing the need to offer something to stay in President Trump’s good graces, he delivered only the bare minimum,\" said Coffey, who was senior adviser Britain's defense ministry.\n\nZelenskyy, on a visit to Finland, said in a Telegram message that Europe must be included in any negotiations.\n\n\"Europe must be at the negotiating table, and everything that concerns European security must be decided together with Europe,\" Zelenskyy wrote.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has long been wary of Putin's willingness to abide by a ceasefire. He said Monday that Russia had already had a week to agree to the terms of the proposed U.S. truce − and that additional pressure is needed to force Putin's hand.\n\n\"It’s clear to everyone in the world – even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years – that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,\"Zelenskyy said.\"He’s saying whatever he wants, but not what the whole world wants to hear.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said since the talks began that Ukraine would have to make concessions. They range from territory seized by Russia to its dream of NATO membership and include a battle for control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched a large-scale attack against Ukraine in 2022. It is currently in control of roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory, much of it in the east.\n\nTrump indicated over the weekend that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine has been thetopic of earlydiscussion. The plant is under Russian occupation.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants because that's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.\n\nUkraine is all but certain to lose out on NATO membership for the foreseeable future, U.S. officials have signaled, and it will have to give up at least some of the territory that Russia seized.\n\n\"The Russians can’t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it’ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014,\"Rubio said last week.\"So the only solution to this war is diplomacy and getting them to a table where that’s possible.\"\n\nRussia has said thatNATO membership, which it has used as a pretext for its war, is a nonstarter. It has also rejected a UK-led proposal to put European peacekeepers in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has said it will not sign a peace agreement without firm security guarantees,citing Russia's historyof violating ceasefires.\n\nTrump has abstained from making security guarantees beyond an unsigned critical minerals agreement that would benefit the U.S. financially if private companies invest in Ukraine's natural resources. He has offered his support to a European peacekeeping force without detailing any potential U.S. involvement.\n\nIn its statement after Trump's call with Putin, the White House emphasized his desire to lessen tension with Russia.\n\n\"There is also a broader strategy at play in President Trump’s approach to this war that is informed by the realization that the United States needs to reset relations with Russia,\" said Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington this month.",

Epic!\"\n\nPutin agreedduring the callto a limited ceasefire on attacks against energy infrastructure targets, the Kremlin said in a readout, but he declined to sign on to the conditions of a broader ceasefire that Ukraine had agreed to.\n\nThe Russian president also called for a \"complete cessation\" of foreign military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, emphasizing the ask as a \"key condition\" for lasting peace.\n\nIn its readout, the White House described the call as the first step in a \"movement to peace\" it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the war, which Russia launched in February 2022.\n\nTrump's phone call with Putin was the first known conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire with Russia last week.\n\nThe Trump administration's thawing of relations with Russia comes after Trump stunned Ukraine andNATOallies by berating Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyat an Oval Office meeting last month.\n\nShortly after the meeting ended, Trump ordered that the United States halt military assistance to Ukraine until Zelensky agreed to sign a rare earth minerals agreement with the U.S. Multiple media reports also said the U.S. had paused some intelligence-sharing with its longtime ally.\n\nUkraine later said it was ready to sign a temporary ceasefire deal with Russia following talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.\n\nThe White House issued its readout of Trump and Putin's phone call on Tuesday afternoon, saying the two leaders \"agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace.\"\n\n\"They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.\"\n\nThe White House's readout of the call, which lasted for more than two hours, went on to say the Russia-Ukraine war \"should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts.\"\n\nIt did not say who was responsible for starting the war.\n\nTrump and Putin further \"agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace.\"\n\nAccording to the White House's readout, the two leaders also discussed tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran.\n\nThey \"spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent further conflicts\" and \"shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,\" the readout said.\n\nThe Kremlin's readout did not mention any discussion of Iran.\n\nThe White House again emphasized that an \"improved bilateral relationship\" between the U.S. and Russia \"has huge upside,\" including \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nThe Kremlin's readout, meanwhile, said Putin has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire on attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure targets.\n\n\"Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,\" the readout said. \"Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave theRussian militarythe corresponding order.\"\n\nHowever, the Kremlin went on to say that a 30-day ceasefire must include an end to \"forced mobilization in Ukraine\" and the rearmament of Ukraine's armed forces. It did not include any concessions from Russia's side regarding its mobilization efforts.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social after the call:\"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one.

Talks for a permanent peace will 'begin immediately' in the Middle East although Putin told Trump that he has several conditions he wants met in order for the fighting to end.\n\n'The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,' theWhite Housesaid in its readout of the call.\n\nThe White House statement also contained a key detail hinting at a realignment of the Middle East: a statement of support forIsraeloverIran.\n\n'The two leaders sharedthe viewthat Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,' the readout said.\n\nIt hinted at the potential for a future shift in the world order in which Moscow becomes less forthright in its support of Tehran, which has been a longtime ally.\n\n'The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts,' the White House said. The U.S. has hosted separate talks with Ukraine and Russian officials inSaudi Arabia.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened Iran for its support of the Houthis and demanded it end its nuclear program. If he can foster a closer relationship between Putin andIsraeliPrime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, he could see an end to the Russia-Iran alliance, which would benefit the United States.\n\nThe White House also hinted at a shakeup of American foreign relations that would include a closer relationship between Washington and Moscow.\n\nBoth leaders 'stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia.'\n\nAn improved U.S.-Russian relationship 'has huge upside,' the administration noted. 'This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.'\n\nTrump expressed optimism there would a 'complete ceasefire' soon.\n\n'My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one. We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War,' he wrote on Truth Social.\n\n'That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!'\n\nIn an interview taped for Fox News Channel's 'The Ingraham Angle' on Tuesday, the president also called it a 'great call.'\n\n'We want to get it over with. Look, we're doing this,' he insisted on reaching a deal, but he also said that aid to Ukraine was not discussed.\n\nHe also said 'with Russia, they would like to have some of our economic power.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump went into Tuesday's call confident he could get a ceasefire deal\n\nAs part of the 'energy and infrastructure ceasefire' agreement, Putin agreed to halt attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days. He has been attacking electricity production causing blackouts throughout Ukraine, which has affected everything from heating, water distribution, sewage and public health.\n\nRussia also took control of Ukraine's nuclear plant. There have been worries the war could spark a nuclear meltdown if the plant is hit. And Moscow has been hitting the country's gas lines.\n\nUkraine has been doing its own damage to Russia's infrastructure.\n\nKyiv has conducted drone strikes in recent days on Russian fuel facilities as it tries to cripple the Kremlin. Its attacks on Russian refineries, oil depots and industrial sites have been on the rise since January.\n\nThe attacks knocked out up to about 10 percent of Russian refining capacity for several weeks in February. Energy is the Kremlin's biggest export and provides funding for Putin's war.\n\nAdditionally, Putin has conditions for a permanent end to the fighting, saying he wants the United States and its allies to end military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine to halt hostilities, according to the Kremlin readout.\n\n'It was emphasized that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution through political and diplomatic means should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv,' Moscow said.\n\nEuropean allies, however, are worried that could result inMoscowrearming itself during a ceasefire, leavingKyivshort-handed and playing catchup.\n\n'Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace,' the White House said.\n\n'The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has his own conditions for peace\n\nIn other news out of Tuesday's phone call, Putin told Trump that Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 175 prisoners of war each on Wednesday, and Russia will also hand over to Ukraine 23 badly wounded soldiers.\n\nTheir call lasted about two hours, beginning around 10 am ET and concluding at noon. Trump spoke from the Oval Office, where he was joined by Vice PresidentJ.D. Vanceand Secretary of StateMarco Rubio.\n\nAs part of it, Trump agreed with Putin's idea for an ice hockey game between U.S. and Russian players, the Kremlin noted.\n\n'Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin's idea of organizing hockey matches in the United States and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL,' Moscow said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President VolodymyrZelenskysaid Europe must be a part of any negotiations on a permanent ceasefire.\n\n'Europe must be at the negotiating table, and everything that concerns European security must be decided together with Europe,' he said in a statement.\n\nZelensky has said repeatedly that Putin cannot be trusted.\n\nUkraine has yet to respond to the agreement for a 30-day ceasefire on energy and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday morning's call was the first known conversation between Trump and Putin since Ukraine agreed last week to support a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire as long asRussiadoes the same.\n\nTrump went into the call confident he could get a ceasefire deal.\n\n'We can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace and I think we'll be able to do it,' he said on Monday.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier in the Kharkiv region - the war with Russia has been going on three years\n\nAhead of their conversation, Trump said he planned to discuss land and power plants with Putin.\n\n'We'll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants, that's a big question,' he said.\n\nThe power plant in question is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe six-reactor nuclear plant is Europe's largest. Russia seized control of it early in the war and still has it in their possession.\n\nThe plant has not supplied power to Ukraine's grid since its capture. But its proximity to frontline fighting has raised concerns about the risk of a radiological disaster.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article."
