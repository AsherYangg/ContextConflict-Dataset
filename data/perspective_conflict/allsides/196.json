        "source_1": "Amid long, uncomfortable pauses,Joe Bidenstruggled to recall when his son died, when he left office as vice president, what year Donald Trump was elected or why he had classified documents he shouldn't have had, according to audio Axios obtained of hisOctober 2023 interviewswithspecial counsel Robert Hur.\n\nWhy it matters:The newly released recordings of Biden having trouble recalling such details — while occasionally slurring words and muttering — shed light on why his White House refused to release the recordings last year, asquestions mounted about his mental acuity.\n\nThe big picture:The audio surfaces as Democrats and the national media are grappling with the legacy of Biden's White House and campaign hiding his decline as he ran for another four-year term at age 81.\n\nBetween the lines:The audio shows what the transcript lacks — the president's dry-whisper voice and the long silences as he struggles to find the right words or dates. Those often were supplied by his attorneys, who acted as caretakers of his memory.\n\nThis is howthat part of the interview is recounted in the transcript: Biden says, \"OK, yeah. In 2017, Beau had passed and — this is personal — the genesis of the book and the titlePromise Me, Dad, was a — I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Beau was like my right arm and Hunt was my left.\"\n\n\"...of the book and the titlePromise Me, Dad, was a …\"\n\n\"... I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Beau was ..\"\n\nReality check:While Biden had clear memory lapses and needed assistance at times (with words such as \"fax machine\" and \"poster board\"), overall he was engaged in the interview.\n\nZoom in:Throughout his testimony, Biden sounded more like a nostalgic, grandfatherly storyteller than a potential defendant who could be accused of hoarding secret papers. He waxed on about:\n\n\"Am I making any sense to you?\"Biden asked at one point while discussing the classification process for sensitive documents.\n\nThough amiable, the interview became somewhat tense when Biden attorney Bob Bauer chastised prosecutor Krickbaum for leading Biden to consider changing his story about why he kept a classified document about Afghanistan.\n\nThat admission of intenttechnically could have exposed Biden to criminal charges, and Bauer soon interjected:\"I just really would like to avoid, for the purpose of a clean record, getting into speculative areas.… He does not recall specifically intending to keep this memo after he left the vice presidency.\"\n\nIn another instance,Krickbaum noted that DOJ had a copy of a recording made by Mark Zwonitzer, the ghostwriter ofPromise Me, Dad, whom Biden told in 2017, \"I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.\"\n\nZoom out:Hur's report concluded that this evidence wasn't enough to persuade a jury to convict Biden — especially given how cooperative Biden had been (unlike Trump in his case) and how likable and forgetful Biden was.\n\nBiden's defendersincluded then-Vice President Harris, who blasted Hur's report and called his comments about Biden's age \"gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told Axios: \"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden's administration was blasted on social media following a report from Axios featuring audio from Biden's interview with former special counsel Robert Hur, depicting the former president's memory lapses and prolonged pauses.\n\nNewsweekreached out to Biden's office via online form and theDemocratic National Committee(DNC) via email Friday night for comment.\n\nThe interview was conducted in 2023, amid the special counsel's investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents. PresidentDonald Trumpwas also under investigation for accusations of improper handling of classified documents after his first term.\n\nUltimately, Hur recommended Biden not be prosecuted,calling the former presidenta \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.\"DemocratsandRepublicansalike strongly reacted to Hur's findings, as some called his remarks out of line and others griped with his conclusion.\n\nThe obtained audio comes at the end of a harsh week for the former president, as excerpts fromCNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson's new bookOriginal Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Againwere published by multiple media outlets.\n\nBidendropped out of the 2024 presidential race in late July, following a disastrous debate performance against then-Republicanpresidential nominee Trump. Biden repeatedly stared at Trump and made halting statements where he appeared to lose his train of thought. Biden later said he had \"a bad, bad night.\"\n\nQuestions swirled about his mental acuity and possible decline as the White House and Vice PresidentKamala Harrisfielded questions about his cognitive ability in the final months of his presidency.\n\nIn the Axios report, Biden can be heard taking elongated pauses, stumbling on key dates like the death of his son Beau Biden, and not finishing his train of thought.\n\nA clock can also be heard in the background, marking every second of elapsing time between thoughts.\n\nThe interviews were held over a two-day period, with Axios reporting that the former president sounded \"much more engaged and vigorous\" on day two.\n\nAfter the audio was made public, Republicans jumped to react to the news on social media.\n\nGOP Congressman James Comer of Kentucky said on X, formerlyTwitter, on Friday that, \"Democrats told you the Biden Hur audio tapes didn't matter. Democrats told you Special Counsel Robert Hur was interfering in an election. Democrats told you over and over that Joe Biden was 'sharp.' The cover-up of Joe's mental decline is a scandal of historic proportions.\"\n\nThe GOP Oversight Committee also reacted on X: \"When we subpoenaed the Hur audio tapes, Democrat Jamie Raskin claimed the 'format of the medium' doesn't matter. Reading 250 pages doesn't capture the mumbling, confusion, or long silences. The tape speaks for itself.\"\n\nHur's transcript of the interviews was released in March 2024.\n\nRepublican Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona alsosaid on X Friday, \"Joe Biden was a demented, feeble, old man during his presidency. Who was running the country?\"\n\nSteve Guest, SenatorTed Cruz's former communications adviser, reacted to the audioon X Friday, saying, \"Joe Biden's brain was pudding as president and his team covered it up.\"\n\nGuest continued, \"There are people with advanced dementia in nursing homes whose nurses can hold more coherent conversations with them than Robert Hur had with Joe Biden.\"\n\nIn Biden's 2024 annual physical, his doctorKevin O'Connor saidthat Biden was \"a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.\"\n\nAxios also reports that during the interview, Biden went off on tangents about riding in a Corvette with Jay Leno, the type of wood and moldings that were in renovated rooms of his house and how former PresidentBarack Obamaadvised him not to run for office in 2016.\n\nIn the audio, Biden's attorney Bob Bauer can also be heard coming to his defense, saying after a question that \"I just really would like to avoid, for the purpose of a clean record, getting into speculative areas.\"\n\nBiden spokesperson Kelly Scully, to Axios:\"The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.\"\n\nFormer Obama adviser David Axelrod posted to X on Thursday:\"A lot of folks now are acknowledging what was obvious then: A guy, who was already showing frailties and would have been closer to 90 than 80 by the end of his second term should not have run for the hardest job on the planet. Never was going to end well.\"\n\nAxelrod continued, \"Next to being President, the pressure of running for it is almost as hard. The idea that an 81-year-old man, already limited, could handle both--and then serve another four years--always was nuts. And the people closest to him did him no favor by not telling him the truth.\"\n\nIt is unclear whom the Democrats will rally behind as their next leader amid the party's uncertain direction at the moment.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAnna Commander is a Newsweek Editor and writer based in Florida.

        "source_3": "Audio of former PresidentJoe Biden‘s October 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur was leaked Friday, revealing more insight into the ex-president’s memory lapses about important information.\n\nDuring the interview Hur conducted for the investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, Biden struggled to remember key dates, including when his son Beau Biden died and when PresidentDonald Trumpwas first elected, and he trailed off topic when recalling past memories.\n\nThe audio recordings were published byAxioson Friday. However, transcripts of the interviews were made public just weeks after Hur’s report came out early last year. The audio provides a deeper look into how Biden struggled through his interviews with Hur, in which his lawyers had to assist the then-president in remembering key dates and keeping him on topic.\n\nBiden said his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015, died in 2017 or 2018. He also said that Trump was elected in 2017, but he was corrected by one of his lawyers, who said it was 2016.\n\nBiden then trailed off as he recounted his memoir,Promise Me, Dad.\n\nBiden’s lawyer at one point offered to give him a break, but the then-president refused, saying he wanted to “get it done.”\n\nBiden’s spokeswoman Kelly Scully said in a statement to theWashington Examinerthat the audio recordings do not relay any new information.\n\n“The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago,” Scully said. “The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.”\n\nWhite House director of rapid response Jake Schneiderreacted to the leakin a post on X.\n\n“We tried to tell you,” he wrote. “We literally spent years trying to tell you. Please stop acting shocked that Biden was senile, incompetent, and unfit for office.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers pressed former Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the audio tapes last year, but every House Democrat voted against it.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committeeslammed Democratsfor hiding Biden’s condition in an X post.\n\n“Democrats hid the truth from the American people—Biden was unfit to remain President. They must answer for their lock step cover up,” the NRCC posted.\n\nNRCC Deputy Executive Director Jack Pandol said every Democrat who voted against the release of the tapes is “complicit in the cover upof the century” in an X post.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he was leaving it up to Attorney General Pam Bondi as to whether the government would release the tapes.\n\n“Look, everybody understands the condition of him,” Trump said. “I know people that are 89, 90, 92, 93 years old and are literally perfect. But Joe was not one of them, and they did a lot of hiding. They were, they were really playing games. And, you know, you can’t do that. Our country’s at stake.”\n\nADVISERS PRIVATELY DEBATED BIDEN USING WHEELCHAIR IF HE WON REELECTION: BOOK\n\nAlex Thompson, who co-authored the article on the audio leak, alsoco-authored the bookOriginal Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Againwith CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nThe book, which is scheduled to be released May 20, includes more than 200 conversations with Democrats about how the White House shielded the deterioration of Biden’s mental health."
