        "source_1": "Ukraine's security service claimed responsibility Tuesday for killing the head ofRussia's chemical, radiological and biological weapons unit, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) was behind the detonation of an explosive device planted in a scooter next to the entrance of an apartment building in Moscow, according to a Ukrainian source briefed on the matter who was granted anonymity because they're not authorized to speak publicly about sensitive operations.\n\nThe blast on Tuesday morning killed Kirillov and his assistant, who was not identified, according to Russian officials.\n\nRussian officials did not immediately respond to Ukraine's claim of responsibility for the blast.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine’s security services charged Kirillov with the use of banned chemical weapons during Russia'sinvasionof the country, which began in February 2022.\n\nRussian investigators, forensic workers and emergency services were still working at the scene late Tuesday morning, with video published on Telegram by the Investigative Committee showing emergency responders parked outside an apartment building where one entrance could be seen visibly damaged.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered an investigation into Kirillov and his assistant's deaths shortly after the blast hit. They did not name any suspects.\n\nIn October, BritainsanctionedKirillov and the nuclear protection forces for the use of riot control agents and reports of the use of chloropicrin, a chemical choking agent, on the battlefield.\n\nIn a statement at the time, the British government said Kirillov was \"responsible for helping deploy these barbaric weapons\" and had also been \"a significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation, spreading lies to mask Russia’s shameful and dangerous behavior.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova sought to defend Kirillov's record, saying he had been “systematically exposing the crimes of the Anglo-Saxons for many years.\"\n\n“He worked fearlessly,” Zakharova said in a statement published to Telegram on Tuesday. \"He met problems head on. For the Motherland, for the truth. Bright be his memory, may he rest in peace.\"\n\nKirillov held several posts in the Directorate of the Chief of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense troops since 2009 before leading the force, according to the Russian state-run news agency RIA.\n\nChantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London.\n\nDaryna Mayer is an NBC News producer and reporter based in Kyiv, Ukraine.",

        "source_3": "Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) was behind the assassination of Russian General Igor Kirillov, multiple media outlets reported on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources in the agency.\n\nKirillov, thecommanderof the Russian Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense Forces, was killed by an explosion, along with his aide, in southeastern Moscow early on Tuesday. The murder took place hours after the general was accused by Kiev of being linked to the use of chemical agents on the battlefield, a claim Moscow denies outright.\n\nInvestigators suspect that the bomb was hidden inside an electric scooter handle bar and was triggered remotely, Russian media reported.\n\nReuters, the BBC, and Ukrainian media outlets have cited what appears to be the same statement by an SBU source describing the 54-year-old Russian officer as“a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target”for assassination.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, has called the murder of Kirillov a sign of“agony”of the Ukrainian government,“which uses its remaining strength to justify its worthless existence to Western masters, prolong war and death, and explain away the catastrophic situation on the front line.”\n\nThe leaders in Kiev cannot terrorize the Russian people and will be held accountable for their crimes, Medvedev added.\n\nThe general took the helm of the Russian military branch in 2017. He was involved in investigating alleged Ukrainian use of chemical weapons against Russian troops, and provided regular reports about American labs in Ukraine which he claimed were involved in biological warfare research.\n\nKiev operates an extensive assassination program, targeting people it considers enemies of Ukraine, according to media reports and statements by former officials.\n\nMoscow says Kiev is resorting to terrorist tactics due to its military failures. Russian investigators have accused the Ukrainian government of killing journalist Darya Dugina, military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, and other civilians.\n\n© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.
