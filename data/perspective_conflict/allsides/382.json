(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for theCOVID-19 pandemicmost likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has “low confidence” in its own conclusion.\n\nThe finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report released Saturday was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.\n\nThe nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency’s assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.\n\n“I had the opportunity on my first day to make public an assessment that actually took place in the Biden administration. So it can’t be accused of being political,” Ratcliffe told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said the CIA “has assessed that the most likely cause of this pandemic that has wrought so much devastation around the world was because of a lab-related incident in Wuhan. And so we will continue to investigate that moving forward.’'\n\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports the CIA believes COVID most likely originated from a lab, but has low confidence in its own finding.\n\nEarlier reports on the origins of COVID-19have splitover whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.\n\nThe CIA “continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,” the agency wrote in a statement about its new assessment.\n\nInstead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China’s virology labs.\n\nLawmakers have pressured America’s spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It’s a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic’s legacy.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told “Fox News Sunday” it was important now “to make China pay for unleashing this plague on the world.” He mentioned imposing tariffs or passing legislation that would repeal China’s permanent most favored nation status.\n\nChinese authorities havedismissed speculationabout COVID’s origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. On Saturday, a spokesperson for China’s U.S. embassy said the CIA report has no credibility.\n\n“We firmly oppose the politicization and stigmatization of the source of the virus, and once again call on everyone to respect science and stay away from conspiracy theories,” embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile the origin of the virus remains unknown,scientists think the most likely hypothesisis that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probablyracoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the firsthuman cases appeared in late November 2019.\n\nSome official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that reportalso expressed low confidencein the finding.\n\nThe same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus“most likely” spread after escaping from a lab.\n\nRatcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.\n\n“The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,” Ratcliffe said in 2023.\n\nThe CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that could change its assessment.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "source_3": "Having been temporarily banned from Twitter, Facebook, and Google over 'COVID conspiracy theories' (when we first suggested in January 2020 that the fact there was a Level 4 virus lab in Wuhan was likely not a coincidence to the origin of COVID), and being accused by intel officials of being a propaganda spreading site, we couldn't help but see the irony (and not rage, frustration, or desire for retribution), when theCIA itself confirmed this week that it found a lab origin “more likely” for the COVID-19 pandemic, joining two other top U.S. agencies that have previously made the assessment.\n\n“CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a Jan. 25 statement to media outlets.\n\nMore comical is the fact that, despite no actual physical evidence of a natural origin, the agency emphasized that it has “low confidence” in the assessment andstill considers it plausible that the virus came from nature.\n\nThe CIA will “continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA’s assessment,”the spokesperson said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's nominee for CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, testifies before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 15, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times\n\nAs Eva Fu reports for The Epoch Times,the assessment marks a shift in stance from the intelligence agency that has for years refrained from making a conclusion on the issue, citing lack of information.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, the new CIA director, has long supported the lab leak possibility, telling a congressionalpanelin April 2023 that it’s the “only explanation” for the disease that has since killed millions around the globe.\n\nAfter gaining Senateconfirmation, Ratcliffe told Breitbart News that addressing the pandemic origin would be a “day one” priority for him.\n\n“I’ve been on record, as you know, in saying I think our intelligence, our science, and our common sense all really dictates that the origins of COVID was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,”he said, adding that he plans to look at intelligence and get the agency “off the sidelines.”\n\nThe international efforts to get more clarity about the source of the virus from China have made little headway.\n\nIn late December 2024, the World Health Organization repeated arequestfor Beijing to share COVID-related data.\n\n“This is a moral and scientific imperative,”the organization said.“Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.”\n\nIn the years since the pandemic broke out from central Chinese city Wuhan, Beijing has silenced on-the-groundcitizenjournalists, doctors, and academics who sought to shed light on theissueor criticize the regime’s handling of the virus.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, said he was pleased to see the CIA’s assessment.\n\n“I’ve said from the beginning that COVID likely originated in the Wuhan labs. Communist China covered it up and the liberal media covered for them,”he said in a Jan. 25statement“Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world.”\n\nThe FBI and the Energy Department have previously assessed that the virus had originated from a lab. The State Department, under the first Trump administration, said in afact sheetthat several researchers had fallen sick with COVID-like symptoms in the autumn of 2019, months before the pandemic exploded to a global scale.\n\nLeaked Chinese documents that The Epoch Timesobtainedalso show that Chinese hospitals were treating patients with COVID-like symptoms months before the regime’s official timeline.\n\n“The Chinese government, it seems to me, has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here—the work that we’re doing, the work that our U.S. government and close foreign partners are doing. And that’s unfortunate for everybody,”then-FBI Director Christopher Wraysaidin early 2023."
