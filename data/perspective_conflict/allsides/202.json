Aides then began taking many more precautions to avoid a repeat before the November 2024 election.\n\nThe intrigue:O'Connor had long privately expressed concern about the toll the presidency was taking on Biden's health.\n\nZoom in:Throughout 2024, Biden aidestold reportersthat the president's halting walk was partly the result of himfracturing his footin November 2020, and then refusing to consistently wear his walking boot. In short, they said, Biden was being undone by his own vigor.\n\nZoom out:Biden, his family, and senior White House officials pushed forward with the president's re-election campaign despite seeing signs of physical and mental decline over the course of his administration, the authors write.\n\nWhat they're saying:Asked about the book's reporting, a Biden spokesperson who declined to be identified said in a statement to Axios that Biden's \"medical exam made clear that he had a stiffened gait caused, in part, by wear and tear to his spine — but that no special treatment was necessary and that it had not worsened.\"",
        "source_2": "Joe Biden's aides have hit back at a new book that accuses a White House inner circle of covering up the former US president's \"physical deterioration\" during his ill-fated re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to the book, Original Sin, Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential run was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden, 82, said \"evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity\" and maintained the Democrat had been \"a very effective president\".\n\nThe book, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, is due to be released on 20 May.\n\nBiden abruptly ended his re-election campaign last July shortly after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nParty insiders blamed him for exiting the race too late, leaving his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 107 days to challenge Trump, who swept to victory.\n\nAhead of the book's release, Biden last week gave his first interview since leaving the White Houseto the BBC, saying: \"I don't think it would have mattered\" if he had left the race sooner.\n\nWhile the book largely cites anonymous sources in interviews with more than 200 people, one of the few to be quoted on the record is David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign.\n\n\"We got so screwed by Biden as a party,\" the book quotes Plouffe as saying.\n\nThe authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.\n\n\"Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,\" the book adds.\n\nBiden's physical condition had declined so much, the authors said, that aides had sought to ensure he walked shorter distances, used handrails when mounting stairs, and wore trainers more often.\n\nAt the time, Biden aides repeatedly told reporters his altered gait was due to a foot fracture in November 2020 and his subsequent refusal to consistently wear his prescribed surgical boot.\n\nIn a statement to Axios, an anonymous Biden aide said: \"Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.\n\n\"In fact, the evidence points to the opposite - he was a very effective president.\"\n\nTapper and Thompson's book also says that Biden did not recognise George Clooney at a star-studded California campaign fundraiser last June  hosted by the Hollywood star.\n\n\"Thank you for being here,\" Biden told Clooney at the event, apparently unaware he was speaking to the Academy Award winner.\n\n\"You know George,\" an aide reportedly told Biden, as he was struggled to work out Clooney's identity.\n\nNot long after the incident, Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to quit the race. The actor was one of the first major donors to publicly withdraw his support.\n\nThe book also alleges that Biden forgot the names of veteran aides, including trusted loyalist Mike Donilon, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

        "source_3": "Former President Joe Biden’s aides hadbecome so concerned about his physical deteriorationthat they’d  discussed him using a wheelchair if he won re-election in 2024,according to a bombshell book out next week.\n\nThe private conversations were laid bare in a new book “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” co-authored byAxios reporter Alex Thompsonand CNN host Jake Tapper, that details the lengths to which the Biden administration and its allies tried to conceal the 46th president’s lack of fitness for office.\n\n“Biden’s physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn’t do so until after the election,” read an except from “Original Sin” first reported Tuesday by Axios, Thompson’s home publication.\n\n“Given Biden’s age, [his physician Kevin O’Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,” Thompson and Tapper wrote.\n\nThe authors also note that O’Connor often argued with Biden aides, trying to get them to build more rest time into the president’s schedule — despite contemporaneous reporting by Thompson that theDemocrat only had a six-hour window of peak effectivenessand became “fatigued” and subject to “verbal miscues” outside the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nBiden would not have been the first president to use a wheelchair in office. Franklin Delano Roosevelt required the device after he was left paralyzed from the waist down by polio in 1921. However, the 32nd president was rarely photographed in a wheelchair and made efforts to conceal his reliance on it in public.\n\nThe former president, his family and aides have been repeatedly ripped for dismissing growing concerns about Biden’s age and mental acuity during his administration.\n\nBiden was dogged by poor polling as he began his abortive re-election run amid widespread fears that his physical stumbles,verbal gaffesand moments of confusionwere signs of advanced agingand cognitive decline.\n\nAt the time, the White House repeatedly insisted there was no cover-up and that he was in good health.\n\nLefty media, including Tapper himself, have since come under fire, too, for dismissing concerns about the then-president’s physical and mental ability..\n\nAn internal Democratic revolt following a poor debate performance against Donald Trump on June 27, 2024, ultimately ledBiden to pull out of the race July 21and endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA Biden spokesperson dismissed the book’s claims of a cover-up, saying “Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.”\n\n“And so far, we are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president.”"
