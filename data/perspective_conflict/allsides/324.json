Judge Ali instead ordered the government to immediately pay its foreign aid contractors for work already done. The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court to intervene, but the court refused to do that, at least for now.\n\nInstead, in an unsigned order, the court noted that although Judge Ali's temporary restraining order has now expired, there are ongoing proceedings about whether he will make that order permanent.\n\nThen the Court did something rather unusual. It gave Judge Ali some guidance on how to proceed, instructing him to \"clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\" In other words, the court majority basically said: If you dot your I's and cross your T's, we've got your back.\n\nThe five justices in the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and the high court's three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The majority didn't say much in their one-page order, but the brief opinion may be construed as a message to lower court judges that the majority will back their decisions as long as they are careful and specific. Of course, the devil is always in the details.\n\nThe four dissenters were Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Writing for them, Alito asked, \"Does a single district court judge … have unchecked power to compel the government of the united states to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\"\n\nChief Justice  Roberts and Justice Barrett, a Trump appointee, notably sided with the Court's three liberal justices to form the majority.\n\nWednesday's decision is likely to be the first of many that reach the Supreme Court this year, so it was notable Tuesday night that the four current Justices who attended the president's address looked distinctly and unusually uncomfortable, as they sat in their seats, barely moving, during the raucous and highly partisan event. The chief justice, who has repeatedly stressed the court's role as an independent legal arbiter, cannot have been happy when Trump, while leaving the chamber, stopped to shake hands with the members of the court, telling Roberts,  \"Thank you again, I won't forget,\" apparently referring to the chief justice's opinion last summer granting trump broad immunity from prosecution even while out of office.\n\nBottom line: There is a long and rocky road ahead for both men at the nation's highest court, a court that is itself, sharply divided.",

        "source_3": "TheSupreme Courthas upheld a lower court’s order requiring the United States Agency for International Development and theState Departmentto immediately pay approximately $2 billion owed to contractors for work already completed.\n\nIn a 5-4decisionWednesday, the justices denied theTrump administration’s request to vacate the lower court’s order, allowing the payments to proceed, though Republican-appointed Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision marks a legal defeat for the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze the funds as part of its broader attempt to curtail foreign aid spending, one that some sympathetic justices described as shocking.\n\nIn his dissent, Alito condemned the majority’s decision, arguing that a single district judge should not have the unchecked power to compel the federal government to disburse such a large sum of money. He chided the majority for a “most unfortunate misstep that rewards an act of judicial hubris” by U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, who last week gave the Trump administrationjust under two daysto unfreeze $2 billion in payments for work already conducted by USAID contractors.\n\nAlito also emphasized concerns over sovereign immunity and the loss oftaxpayerfunds, writing, “The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.” His argument, joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, appeared to support the notion that the government would never be able to retrieve the $2 billion in allocated funds if they were later found to be unjustified or fraudulent in nature.\n\nTwo of the court’s Republican appointees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, sided with the Democratic appointees in declining to undo a lower court’s order.\n\nThe ruling comes after a temporary stay issued by Roberts on Feb. 26, which paused a lower court’s mandate that compelled the government to disburse the funds by midnight that day.\n\nThe legal dispute began when the administration moved to halt USAID foreign aid payments, prompting a lawsuit from contractors and nonprofit groups that had already completed projects and were awaiting compensation. On Feb. 13, Ali issued a temporary restraining order barring the administration from freezing the funds. The court followed up with a Feb. 25 order requiring immediate payment for work performed before the restraining order was put in place.\n\nThe ruling underscores broader tension between the administration’s aggressive executive actions and the judiciary’s role in checking presidential authority.\n\nSUPREME COURT SIDES WITH TRUMP IN USAID FUNDING DISPUTE FOR NOW\n\nAli is expected to hold a hearing on Thursday over the aid groups’ motion for a preliminary injunction. If it is granted, it would suspend the freeze on foreign-assistance funding going forward.\n\nThis means that the dispute could return to the Supreme Court as an emergency appeal in the near future."
