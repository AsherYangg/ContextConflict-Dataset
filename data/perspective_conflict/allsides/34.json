        "source_1": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticises France’s ‘reckless decision’ that he claims ‘only serves Hamas propaganda’.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said Washington “strongly rejects” French President Emmanuel Macron’s plan torecognise a Palestinian state, as the administration of President Donald Trump announced it would not attend an upcoming United Nations conference seeking a two-state solution for Palestinians.\n\nPosting on X late on Thursday, Rubio criticised Macron’s “reckless decision”, which he claimed “only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace”.\n\nEarlier, Macron had said he would formalise France’s decision to officially recognise a Palestinian state at the UN’s General Assembly in September.\n\n“In keeping with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine,” Macron wrote on X.\n\nAt least 142 countries out of the 193 members of the UN currently recognise or plan to recognise a Palestinian state. But several powerful Western countries – including the US, the United Kingdom and Germany – have refused to do so.\n\nFellow European Union members Norway, Ireland and Spainindicated in Maythat they had begun the process to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nBut Macron’s decision would make France – one of Israel’s closest allies and a G7 member – the largest and arguably most influential country in Europe to make the move.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision, saying such a move “rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy”.\n\n“A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel – not to live in peace beside it,” he said in a post on X.\n\n“Let’s be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,” Netanyahu added.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz also described the move as “a disgrace and a surrender to terrorism”. He added that Israel would not allow the establishment of a “Palestinian entity that would harm our security, endanger our existence”.\n\nWhile supporting a two-state solution remains the long-held official stance of the US, President Donald Trump has himself expressed doubts about its viability. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump suggested the US could “take over” Gaza, displace the territory’s more than two million Palestinian population, and transform it into the“Riviera of the Middle East”.\n\nTrump’s plan has been condemned by rights groups, Arab states, Palestinians and the UN as tantamount to “ethnic cleansing”.\n\nIn June, Washington’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, also said he did not think an independent Palestinian state remained a US foreign policy goal.\n\nHis comments prompted Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce to say Huckabee “speaks for himself” and policy-making is a matter for Trump and the White House.\n\nOn Thursday, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the US will not attend an upcoming conference set to be held at the UN on the two-state solution. The conference – co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, and scheduled to take place between July 28-30 – seeks to chart a roadmap to end the decades-long conflict and recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Pigott said there was “nothing further” to say about the issue other than that Washington “will not be in attendance”.\n\nThere is mounting pressure on Israel to end its deadly war on Gaza, waged in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which saw some 1,139 people killed and more than 200 captives taken to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nIsrael’s subsequent 21-month assault on Gaza has resulted in almost 60,000 Palestinians being killed, with a further 144,000 wounded.\n\nMonths-long ceasefire negotiations – brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar – have so far failed to yield a breakthrough.\n\nOn Monday, 28 countries – including the UK, Japan and numerous European nations –issued a joint statementtelling Israel the war on Gaza “must end now”.\n\nThe joint statement also condemned “the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food”.",

Peace is possible. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\" he wrote.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed Macron's decision, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move \"rewards terror\" following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack in Israel.\n\nThe US \"strongly rejects\" Macron's announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, calling the decision \"reckless\".\n\nThe G7 is a group of major industrialised nations, which alongside France includes the US, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan.\n\nIn his Thursday post on X, Macron wrote: \"True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"We must also guarantee the demilitarisation of Hamas, and secure and rebuild Gaza.\n\n\"Finally, we must build the State of Palestine, ensure its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the Middle East. There is no alternative.\"\n\nMacron also attached a letter to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas confirming his decision.\n\nResponding to Macron's announcement, Abbas' deputy Hussein al-Sheikh said, \"This position reflects France's commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people's rights to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state\", according to the AFP news agency.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu wrote in a post on X: \"We strongly condemn President Macron's decision to recognise a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the 7 October massacre.\n\n\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel -  not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nHamas said France's decision was a \"positive step in the right direction\" and urged all countries of the world \"to follow France's lead\".\n\nCurrently, the State of Palestine is recognised by more than 140 of the 193 member states of the UN.\n\nA few European Union countries, including Spain and Ireland, are among them.\n\nBut Israel's main supporter, the US, and its allies including the UK have not recognised a Palestinian state.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he will hold an \"emergency call\" with French and German leaders on Friday to discuss \"what we can do urgently to stop the killing\".\n\nStatehood is an \"inalienable right of the Palestinian people\", Sir Keir said, adding that a ceasefire would \"put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution\".\n\nSir Keir's statement came as he faces growing pressure,including from his own MPs, for the UK to follow France's lead.\n\nOn Friday, a majority of MPs on the foreign affairs committee, which scrutinises UK foreign policy, called for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine, adding it should make the move \"while there is still a state to recognise\".\n\n\"An inalienable right should not be made conditional,\" a committee report said.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign ministry praised France's decision, saying it \"reaffirms the international community's consensus on the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state\".\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 59,106 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nMuch of Gaza has been reduced to rubble since then.\n\nEarlier on Thursday,the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that one in five children in Gaza City was now malnourishedand cases were increasing every day.\n\nMore than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation in the Gaza Strip - pressing for governments to take action.\n\nIsrael, which controls the entry of all supplies into the Palestinian territory, has repeatedly said that there is no siege, blaming Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.\n\nIsrael said it targeted well known reporter Anas al-Sharif and alleged he was part of Hamas, which Al Jazeera has denied.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets certain conditions.\n\nIt follows similar moves by the UK, France and Canada.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".",
        "source_3": "OAN StaffBlake Wolf5:17 PM – Thursday, July 24, 2025\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France is officially set to recognize “the State of Palestine,” becoming the first G7 nation to do so.\n\nMacron made the announcement on Thursday in an X post.\n\n“Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine. I will make this solemn announcement before the United Nations General Assembly this coming September. The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population. Peace is possible. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and massive humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. We must also ensure the demilitarization of Hamas, secure and rebuild Gaza,” Macron said.\n\n“And finally, we must build the State of Palestine, guarantee its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarization and fully recognizing Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the region. There is no alternative. The French people want peace in the Middle East. It is our responsibility — as French citizens, alongside Israelis, Palestinians, and our European and international partners — to prove that peace is possible. In light of the commitments made to me by the President of the Palestinian Authority, I have written to him to express my determination to move forward. Trust, clarity, and resolve. We will achieve peace,” he added.\n\n146 of the 193 United Nations (UN) member states have officially recognized Palestine as a sovereign state, although France’s recognition is seen as significant — as it is the first G7 nation and member of the UN Security Council to do so.\n\nThe announcement comes as the United States has announced that it was exiting ceasefire talks, with U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff explaining that Hamas has refused to engage in good-faith negotiations.\n\n“We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza,” Witkoff wrote on Thursday.\n\n“While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith. We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza. It is a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way. We are resolute in seeking an end to this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza,” Witkoff added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also responded to the news coming out of France.\n\n“We [Israel] strongly condemn President Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the October 7 massacre. Such a move rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became. A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel – not to live in peace beside it. Let’s be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel.”\n\nWe strongly condemn President Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the October 7 massacre. Such a move rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a…\n\nAdditionally, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin denounced the move as “a black stain on France’s history and a direct boost to terrorism.”\n\n“The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel, and even President Macron’s declaration will not change that,” he added, while calling for Israel to annex Gaza and the West Bank in response to Macron’s post.\n\nOn the flip side, Hussein al‑Sheikh, deputy to President Mahmoud Abbas, the second president of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority, praised the decision — saying it “reflects France’s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s rights to self‑determination.”\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry also similarly welcomed Macron’s statement as part of efforts to revive a peace process.\n\nIn addition, Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris called France’s move “an important contribution towards implementing the two‑State solution.” Harris has long emphasized the “moral and legal rationale” behind recognizing Palestinian statehood. Harris has suggested that Ireland coordinates with Spain and Norway to press for collective recognition, and he has urged other European nations to join the effort.\n\nStay informed!
