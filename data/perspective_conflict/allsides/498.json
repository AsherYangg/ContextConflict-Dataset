    "question": "How might media emphasis on striking findings from individual polls and dramatic language about a “razor-thin” race, even as aggregator models show a near tossup, shape public understanding, campaign decisions, and voter turnout in the final weeks before Election Day?",

        "source_1": "With four weeks to go until Election Day, the 2024 polls continue to show a presidential race that remains on a knife’s edge — and well within the margin of error.\n\nThat’s true for recent national polls like NPR/PBS/Marist, which found Vice President Kamala Harris with a narrow edge against former President Donald Trump — 2 points among likely voters, 50%-48%, within the poll’s margin of error (plus or minus 3.7 percentage points).\n\nIt’s also true in the polls of the battleground states that will ultimately decide the presidential contest.\n\nHarris and Trump are essentially tied, perhaps with a slight lean toward Trump, in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. And while Harris has a slightly greater advantage in the Great Lakes states of Michigan and Wisconsin, those advantages are well within the boundaries of potential polling error. And the recent polling in all-important Pennsylvania — part of themost direct paths to 270 electoral votesfor both Harris and Trump — appears to be a jump ball.\n\nGiven polls’ margins of error, historically low response rates when reaching voters and, yes, past polling misses, it’s become afool’s errandto expect precision from political polls.\n\nWhat wecanconclude from the public polling, however, is whether a race is close or not. And this race remains very close no matter how you look at it, across polls in all different states and nationally, including polls that have different assumptions of the 2024 electorate and thatuse different weighting techniques.\n\nThe polls also are helpful in determining a race’s trend. And this is afundamentally different racethan the one that existed before President Joe Biden stepped aside from his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris.\n\nAnd the polls are useful in measuring a politician’s popularity: Most surveys right now show Harris withhigher favorable ratingsthan Trump, after a sharp upswing in her numbers when she became a presidential candidate this summer.\n\nBut the polls can’t tell us if a candidate is going to win a presidential contest if they’re ahead or behind by 1-2 points in a few surveys, whether nationally or in key battleground states.\n\nThe 2024 race, ultimately, will be decided by turnout, concluding news events, how the third-party/undecided vote breaks and other factors. Ultimately, what will matter is which candidate wins the important battleground states that could come down to a difference of 10,000 or 20,000 votes — margins too small to expect unambiguous clarity from pre-election polls.\n\nMark Murray is a senior political editor at NBC News.",

It surveyed 997 voters and had a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percent. Of respondents, 49 percent said they would vote for Harris and 46 percent said they would vote for Trump.\n\nBut among Independents, Democratic presidential candidate Harris received 52 percent of the vote,Republicancandidate Trump received 36 percent, 10 percent were not sure, and 2 percent said they would vote for somebody else.\n\nIndependents are a critical voting block for both Vice President Harris and former president Trump to win over ahead of the November election, which is likely to be determined by close votes in just a handful of key battleground states. Small swings in independent voters could determine whether these states are won by either candidate.\n\nFour years ago in October 2020, a month out from the election,Joe Bidenled Trump among independents by a similar margin to Harris's current lead with independents, and went on to win the election.\n\nAn IBD/TIPP poll from October 2020 showed Biden leading Trump among independents by 9 points, with Biden at 48 percent and Trump at 39 percent.\n\nVoters in this month's TIPP Insights poll were also asked who they thought would win: 44 percent said Harris would win, 38 percent said Trump, 14 percent said it was too close to call, and 4 percent said they did not know.\n\nWhen asked about specific issues, Trump led on \"improving national security\" (Trump 50 percent, Harris 45 percent), \"lowering the national debt\" (Trump 46 percent, Harris 44 percent), \"growing the economy\" (Trump 49 percent, Harris 48 percent), \"securing the border\" (Trump 54 percent, Harris 41 percent), \"reducing crime\" (Trump 48 percent, Harris 46 percent), and \"implementing a strong foreign policy\" (Trump 50 percent, Harris 46 percent).\n\nTrump and Harris tied on two issues: \"cutting spending,\" on 46 percent, and \"cutting inflation,\" on 47 percent. But Harris leads on just two issues, \"ensuring energy security/energy independence\" (Harris 48 percent, Trump 47 percent) and \"reducing taxes\" (Harris 48 percent, Trump 45 percent).\n\nDespite Harris's lead among independents, the race is still very close. With 31 days left until Election Day, Harris is up 2.6 percentage points nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight. RealClearPolling hasHarris up 2.1 pointsover Trump.\n\nVeteran Democratic strategist Matt Bennettpreviously told Newsweekthat despite having entered the race incredibly late, inheriting a campaign that she didn't build and having almost no opportunity to introduce herself or carve out her own political persona, \"it's remarkable that Harris is in as GOOD a position as she's in.\"\n\nNewsweekhas contacted Trump's and Harris' campaigns for comment.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nFlynn Nicholls is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. politics and society.
