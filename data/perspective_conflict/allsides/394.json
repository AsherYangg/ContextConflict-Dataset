Read ourPrivacy notice\n\nSoon-to-be first ladyMelania Trumpinsisted on Monday that she is “independent” and will stand up to her husband, saying she doesn’t always “agree with what Donald is saying” and she is more than “just the wife of the president.”\n\nDuring a friendly sitdown on her spouse’s favorite morning showFox & Friends, the incoming first lady spent much of her time promoting an upcoming documentary on her return to the White House, which was licensed by Amazon foran eye-popping $40 millionand directed bydisgraced Hollywood directorBrett Ratner.\n\nThe film project, which many see as a way for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tofurther cozy upto MAGA, was described by Trump as an opportunity for fans who “would love to hear more from me.” She added that she told her agent to “go out and make a deal” so she could show the day-to-day routine of her return to Washington.\n\nAsked by hostAinsley Earhardtwhat would be “different” this time around when she returns to the White House, Trump didn’t offer up any policy details. Instead, she noted that she was just well aware of the layout of the actual residence.\n\n“The difference is I know where I will be going, I know the rooms where we will be living. I know the process, the first time was challenging,” she said. “But this time, I have everything — I already packed, I already selected the furniture that needs to go in. So it’s very different.”\n\nAt the same time, the former and future first lady declared that when she first came to D.C. eight years ago, “people didn’t accept” her and “didn’t understand” her the way they do now, adding that she “didn’t have much support.”\n\n“Some people, they see me as just the wife of the president, but I’m standing on my own two feet, independent,” she continued. “I have my own thoughts, I have my own yes and no, I don’t always agree with what my husband is saying or doing, and that’s OK.”\n\nEarhardt wondered if that meant she is able to tell the president-elect when she disagrees with him, prompting Trump to insist that is indeed the case.\n\n“I give him my advice, and sometimes he listens,” she stated. “Sometimes he doesn’t. And that’s OK.”\n\nIn her recent best-selling memoirMelania, Trumprevealedthat in stark contrast to her husband and the Republican Party, she is a supporter of abortion rights.\n\n“Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?” she wrote. “A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.”\n\nTrump added: “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.”\n\nElsewhere in the Fox News chat, Trump also said that she would bring back her “Be Best” public awareness campaign, suggesting that the initiative against cyberbullying among children didn’t get enough support during the first Trump administration.\n\n“I will continue with Be Best, and also I will expand Be Best. In the first administration, I didn’t have much support from anyone. I invited all of the streaming platforms to the White House, I had a round table, and I didn’t have much support from them,” she claimed. “Imagine what we could do in those years if they will rally behind me and teach the children and protect them about the social media and their mental health.”\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

But this time I have everything.\"\n\nWith the transition team given five hours to move out the Bidens and move in the Trumps, \"everything needs to be planned to the minute,\" she explained. For Melania, the changing of the guard means packing, establishing her team and turning the White House into her home again.\n\nSincePresident Biden and first lady Jill Bidentook the reins on Jan. 20, 2021, the Trump family have had their lives turned upside down – prosecutions, assassination attempts and another run on the campaign trail to name a few.\n\nTrump emerged victorious over Vice President Kamala Harris last November, sweeping all key swing states and raking in 312 electoral votes. Now, the plan for his first 100 days in office remains front and center – focusing on taxes, immigration and inflation.\n\n\"I think it will be an exciting four years, and we have a lot to do and put the country back in shape,\" Melania said.\n\nTaylor Penley is an associate editor with Fox News.\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
