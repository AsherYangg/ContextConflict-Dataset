    "question": "How might varying state vote-counting and recount rules, together with the Electoral College timeline and the vice president’s certification role, shape public trust and legal or political strategies if the 2024 presidential result remains unsettled after Election Day?",

        "source_1": "The election has already been filled with eye-popping and historically unusual events. One other potential scenario looms this fall: the \"contingent election\" of the president and the vice president that would happen if no one can secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.\n\nThat has not happened in the modern era, but there are a few conceivable (if unlikely) paths across the Electoral College map that could lead to former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris ending the race tied at 269 electoral votes.\n\nSome of those scenarios include Republicans’ winning all of Nebraska’s votes, an uphill battle because the state doles out a vote to the winner of each of its congressional districts and Harris is favored to win in the Omaha-area 2nd District. (That’s why Republicans briefly, and unsuccessfully,sought to change Nebraska’s rulesand make it a winner-take-all state.) And it's much less likely that a third-party candidate will win electoral votes and prevent someone else from getting a majority or that faithless electors will refuse to support a candidate, with the same end result.\n\nIn the event of a tie, Congress would decide the next president.\n\nWhile the process would be hotly contested and historic, Congress has a set process to decide a president in that scenario, which would undoubtedly come after a slew of court challenges in key states aimed at challenging the election results there.\n\n“Each state, regardless of population, casts a single vote for President in a contingent election,” according to theCongressional Research Service. That means the group of House members from each state would choose among the three candidates with the most Electoral College voters, and the candidate with the backing of the majority of states would win.\n\nThe newly elected Congress taking office in January would vote in that scenario. So the results of the congressional elections would loom large.\n\nRepublicans have majority control of 26 state delegations, while Democrats have majority control of 22 delegations, and two states (Minnesota and North Carolina) are tied. Members of Congress would not be bound to vote for their party’s candidate, but they would surely face immense pressure to do so.\n\nAlthough Washington, D.C., has three electoral votes in the presidential election, it would not have a vote in the House in a contingent election because it is not a state.\n\nIn a contingent election, the vice president is chosen by a full vote of the Senate, with each senator casting his or her own vote for one of the two vice presidential candidates with the most electoral votes.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nKamala Harris must certify the presidential election result, regardless of whether she wins or loses.\n\nIt will be her sole task to officially declare the result of the election.\n\nUnder the U.S. constitution, a vice president is automatically president of theSenateand it is the role of the Senate president to officially declare the result of a presidential election.\n\nAs the Senate website explains: \"The Constitution names the vice president of the United States as the president of the Senate. In addition to serving as presiding officer, the vice president … formally presides over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots cast in presidential elections.\"\n\nThe Wilson Center, which reviews democratic institutions and good governance, states on its website that the Senate president \"is charged with counting the electoral votes for president and vice president and announcing the winners.\"\n\nThis second role for the vice president has led to some heated scenes in the past, with some politicians begging vice presidents not to certify a presidential election result.\n\nOn January 6, 2001, more than a dozen Democratic members ofCongressbegged vice presidentAl Gorenot to certify his own defeat in the 2000 presidential election.\n\nThey lodged more than 20 objections. Gore dismissed each one as the objectors were all members of the House of Representatives and needed at least one Senator to agree to their objections.\n\nIt followed 36 days of turmoil following the November 7, 2000 election, with the Florida result hotly contested between Gore andRepublicancandidateGeorge W. Bush.\n\nMost of those objecting to Gore's certification were members of the Congressional Black Caucus and they walked out of the joint session of Congress, on behalf of what Democratic congresswomen Sheila Jackson-Lee announced were \"the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count.\"\n\nWhile dismissing each of their objections, Gore asked: \"Is the point of order signed by a senator?\"\n\n\"I don't care that it is not signed by a senator,\" Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters retorted before walking out.\n\nGore told her: \"You will be advised that the rules do care,\" he said.\n\nCongressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. told Gore: \"It's a sad day in America when we can't find a senator to sign these objections,\" theLos Angeles Timesreported at the time.\n\nThe conflict and the walk out was captured in Michael Moore's documentary,Fahrenheit 9/11, one of the highest grossing U.S. documentaries of all time.\n\nThe importance of the vice president's role in certifying the election was also seen whenDonald Trumpput pressure on his vice president,Mike Pence, not to certify the result of the 2020 election.\n\nPence believed it was his duty to certifyJoe Biden's win.\n\nTrump criticized Biden in aTwittermessage on January 6, 2021, as Trump protesters were trying to break into Congress while it was certifying the election.\n\nTrump was later charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights in connection with an alleged pressure campaign on state officials to reverse the 2020 election results.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and repeatedly said he is the victim of a political witch hunt.\n\nOn July 1, the U.S.Supreme Courtruled that Trump has immunity from prosecution for his communications with Pence while Pence was acting as vice president.\n\nIt also ruled that Trump has \"presumptive immunity\" from his attempts to stop Pence from certifying the election while Pence was acting as Senate president.\n\nIfKamala Harriscertifies the electoral college votes and declares herself the winner, she will not be the first vice president to do so. In 1796, when John Adams was vice president, he declared himself the president in the Senate, having beaten Thomas Jefferson. Four years later, Jefferson was vice president and declared himself the president after counting the votes in the Senate.\n\nUpdate: 11/05/24 07:55 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include details of past vice presidents certifying their own victories in presidential elections.\n\nSean O'Driscoll is a Newsweek Senior Crime and Courts Reporter based in Ireland.

        "source_3": "Whenelectionresults pour in from across thecountryTuesday evening, there will likely be various close and hotly contested races that could end in arecount.\n\nThe presidential race between former PresidentDonald Trumpand Vice PresidentKamala Harriswill likely come down to seven states considered “toss-up” contests, and any of those states’ results could end up in a recount. Here are the laws for recounts in each of the key battleground states.\n\nIn the Grand Canyon State, the law for mandatory recounts only goes into effect if the top two candidates are within 0.5% of each other in the final results. The threshold is higher than the previous 0.1% required in 2020, thanks to a law passed since the last presidential election.\n\nIf the race ends up in the margin for a recount, one will automatically be triggered by a court order.\n\nIn the Peach State, there are no automatic recounts, but a candidate may request a recount under certain circumstances.\n\nA candidate may request a recount if the margin is within or equal to 0.5% between the leading finishers of a race. The state’s laws also allow for the secretary of state or an election official to request a recount if there is a “suspected error or discrepancy,”according tothe state.\n\nIn the Great Lake State, there are provisions for both automatic and requested recounts.\n\nAn automatic recount will occur if the margin between the first-place candidate and the second-place candidate is 2,000 votes or less.\n\nA candidate may request a recount if they have “a good­ faith belief that they would have had a reasonable chance of winning the election,” and they must specify which precincts they seek to have recounted and pay a deposit for each precinct. The deposit depends on the candidate’s margin between themselves and the winner.\n\nIn the Silver State, there are no automatic recounts, but a candidate may request a recount within three working days of the statewide canvass. The candidate must pay a deposit for the recount, which is only refunded if the recount ends up changing the result of the race.\n\nOnce the request has been made, the recount would have to begin within five days, and once it does, it would need to be completed no longer than five days after.\n\nIn the Tar Heel State, a candidate may request a recount if the margin between the winner of a race and second place is at most 0.5% or 10,000 votes, whichever is less.\n\nA candidate must request the recount by 12 p.m. on the second business day after the statewide canvass is completed. The recount costs are covered by the state.\n\nIn the Keystone State, there are provisions for both mandatory and requested recounts.\n\nA mandatory recount occurs in the state if the margin between the top two candidates falls within 0.5%.\n\nA candidate may not request a recount, but three voters in the commonwealth may request a recount no later than five days after the state canvass if they allege fraud or error. The recount cost must be covered by the petitioners but will be refunded if substantial fraud or error is found.\n\nIn the Badger State, a candidate can request a recount within one business day of the canvass. However, if the margin of victory is more than 0.25 percentage points, then the petitioner must pay for the recount.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAs outlined by federal law, states must certify their results and electors to the Electoral College by Dec. 11, 2024.\n\nThe Electoral College will meet on Dec. 17, 2024, and a joint session of Congress will certify the vote of the Electoral College on Jan. 6, 2025."
