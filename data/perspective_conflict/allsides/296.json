        "source_1": "In Friday memo, president also pulls clearances for Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies ina presidential memoissued late on Friday.\n\nThe security-clearance revocations also cover the former secretary of stateAntony Blinken, the former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, the former Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted Trump for fraud, as well as Biden’s entire family. They all will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. He said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.\n\nEarlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump’s memo, along with “the 51 signers of theHunter Bidendisinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nTrump’s decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president’s son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.\n\nMore broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general,Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.\n\nOthers on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss’s alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.\n\nLiz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger,Republicanswho served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.\n\nThe move comes asNBC News reportedthat former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden’s nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nAccording to the network, Biden made the proffer last month when he met the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, but the offer had not been embraced.\n\nAn NBC News pollpublished last weekend found the Democratic party’s popularity has dropped to a record low – only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party. On Friday, Trump was asked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political arena. “I hope so,” he responded.",
        "source_2": "US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton,as well as a number of other former officials and critics.\n\nTrump said in Februaryhe was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of \"any other member\" of the Biden family.\n\n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump's memorandum read.\n\nFormer US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy.\n\nTrump ordered department and agency leaders to \"revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.\"\n\n\"This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,\" the order stated.\n\nFor several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact.\n\nIt may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\n\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\n\nTrump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\n\nBiden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.\n\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\n\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThey were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.\n\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\n\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses.\n\nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024,a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.Trump is appealing the decision.\n\nManhattan district attorneyAlvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\n\nTrump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\n\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\n\nFriday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access.\n\nHowever, Mr Zaid told the BBC that \"despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.\"\n\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm \"the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.\"\n\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\n\"I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,\" Mr Vindman wrote on X.\n\nMr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order \"just makes me file even more lawsuits!\"\n\nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour.\n\nTrump made numerous claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, but his legal challenges to the results did not hold up in the courts and audits in key swing states found that the presidential election results were valid.\n\nIn February, Trump announced he wasrevoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents\".\n\nIn 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his \"erratic behaviour\".\n\nA 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\n\nIn 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.\n\nUpdate 30 July: This story has been updated with further explanation of Trump's claims about the 2020 US presidential election results.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",

There are as many as 18 people on this Detail, which is ridiculous!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Please be advised that, effective immediately, Hunter Biden will no longer receive Secret Service protection. Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list.\"\n\nWhile under federal law, former presidents and their spouses receive life-long Secret Service protection, but that protection ends for members of their immediate family when they leave office. According to theAssociated Press, both Trump and Biden extended protection for their children before leaving office.\n\nRachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
