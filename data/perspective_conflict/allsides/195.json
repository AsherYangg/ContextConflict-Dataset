        "source_1": "The Trump administration is working on a plan to permanently relocate up to 1 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya, five people with knowledge of the effort told NBC News.\n\nThe plan is under serious enough consideration that the administration has discussed it with Libya’s leadership, two people with direct knowledge of the plans and a former U.S. official said.\n\nIn exchange for the resettling of Palestinians, the administration would potentially release to Libya billions of dollars of funds that the U.S. froze more than a decade ago, those three people said.\n\nNo final agreement has been reached, and Israel has been kept informed of the administration’s discussions, the same three sources said.\n\nThe State Department and the National Security Council did not respond to multiple requests for comment before this article was published. After publication, a spokesperson told NBC News that “these reports are untrue.”\n\n“The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBasem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said that Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that has run Gaza, was not aware of any discussions about moving Palestinians to Libya.\n\n“Palestinians are very rooted in their homeland, very strongly committed to the homeland and they are ready to fight up to the end and to sacrifice anything to defend their land, their homeland, their families, and the future of their children,” Naim said in response to questions from NBC News. “[Palestinians] are exclusively the only party who have the right to decide for the Palestinians, including Gaza and Gazans, what to do and what not to do.”\n\nRepresentatives of the Israeli government declined to comment.\n\nLibya has been plagued by instability and warring political factions throughout the nearly 14 years since a civil war broke out in the country and its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, was toppled. Libya is struggling to care for its current population as two rival governments, one in the west led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and one in the east led by Khalifa Haftar, are actively and violently fighting for control. The State Department advises Americans not to travel to Libya “due to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.”\n\nHow many Palestinians in Gaza would voluntarily leave to live in Libya is an open question. One idea administration officials have discussed is to provide Palestinians with financial incentives such as free housing and even a stipend, the former U.S. official said.\n\nThe details of when or how any plan to relocate Palestinians to Libya could be implemented are murky, and an effort to resettle up to 1 million people there would likely face significant obstacles.\n\nSuch an effort would likely be extremely expensive, and it’s not clear how the Trump administration would seek to pay for it. In the past, the administration has said Arab nations would help with rebuilding Gaza after the war there ends, but they havebeen critical of Trump’s idea of permanently relocating Palestinians.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has also looked at Libya as a place where it could send some immigrants it wants to deport from the U.S.However, plans to send one group of immigrants to Libya were stalled by a federal judge this month.\n\nMoving up to 1 million Palestinians to Libya could put far more of a strain on the fragile country.\n\nAfter this story was initially published, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for Dbeibah’s government said in a statement, “﻿The official Libyan government has previously expressed, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Libyan Government, our unequivocal rejection of the issue of resettlement.” The ministry also reiterated its denial of any agreement to take in immigrants deported from the U.S.\n\nHaftar’s Libyan National Army did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTheCIA’s most recent publicly available estimateof Libya’s current population is about 7.36 million. In terms of population, Libya absorbing 1 million more people would be equivalent to the U.S. taking in about 46 million.\n\nPrecisely where Palestinians would be resettled in Libya has not been determined, according to the former U.S. official. Administration officials are looking at options for housing them and every potential method for transporting them from Gaza to Libya — by air, land and sea —is being considered, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.\n\nAny of those methods would likely prove cumbersome and time-consuming, as well as costly.\n\nIt would take around 1,173 flights on the world’s largest passenger airplane, the Airbus A380, at its maximum passenger capacity to transport 1 million people, for instance. With no airport in Gaza, moving anyone from there on flights would first require transporting them to an airport in the region. If Israel does not want to allow Palestinians to come through its territory, the closest airport would be in Cairo, about 200 miles away.\n\nTransportation by land from Gaza through Egypt to Benghazi, Libya’s second-largest city, which is farther east than the capital, Tripoli, would require driving about 1,300 miles. Automobiles typically hold fewer passengers than other modes of transportation. About 55 people can fit in an intercity passenger bus.\n\nUp to 2,000 people can fit on the top-end versions of some of the ferries the U.S. used to transport civilians along the Mediterranean Sea to escape Libya’s civil war in 2011. If those vessels were to be used — and assuming that they didn’t need to refuel and weather conditions were good — it would take hundreds of trips lasting more than a day each way for up to 1 million people to travel from Gaza to Benghazi.\n\nThe plan under discussion is part ofPresident Donald Trump’s vision for a postwar Gaza, which he said in February the U.S. would seek to “own” and rebuild as what he called “the Riviera of the Middle East,” two current U.S. officials, the former U.S. official and the two people with direct knowledge of the effort said.\n\n“We’re going to take over that piece, develop it and create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something the entire Middle East can be proud of,” Trump said at the time.\n\nTo achieve his goal for the reconstruction of Gaza, Trump has said Palestinians there would have to be permanently resettled elsewhere.\n\n“You can’t live in Gaza right now, and I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that’s going to make people happy,” Trump said in February during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump outlined a goal of finding “a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes, and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”\n\n“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” he said.\n\nTrump’s idea, which blindsided some of his top aides, includingSecretary of State Marco Rubio, when he announced it,drew criticism from America’s Arab alliesandU.S. lawmakers from both parties.\n\n“We’ll see what the Arab world says but, you know, that’d be problematic at many, many levels,” Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at the time.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel in March alsorejected a proposal from Egyptfor rebuilding Gaza without relocating Palestinians.\n\nThe administration’s work on a Libya plan comes as Trump’s relationship with Netanyahuhas become strained, in part because of Israel’s decision to launch a new military offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe Trump administration has considered multiple locations for resettling Palestinians living in Gaza, according to a senior administration official, a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions and one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort.\n\nSyria, with its new leadership following the ouster of Bashar al Assad in December, also is under discussion as a possible location for resettling Palestinians currently in Gaza, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the effort and a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken steps toward restoring diplomatic relations with Syria. Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria and met briefly with the country’s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Wednesday.\n\nCourtney Kube is a correspondent covering national security and the military for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\nGordon Lubold is a national security reporter for NBC News.",
        "source_2": "The Trump administration is working on a plan to permanently relocate as much as one million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya, NBC Newsreported Friday, citing five people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe plan is under serious enough consideration that the US has discussed it with Libya’s leadership, the report said, while stressing a final agreement has yet to be reached.\n\nIn exchange for resettling the Palestinians, the administration would release to Libya billions of dollars of funds the US froze more than a decade ago, NBC added.\n\nAccording to three of the sources quoted in the report, Israel has been kept in the loop about the administration’s talks on the matter.\n\n“These reports are untrue,” an administration spokesperson told NBC in response. “The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense.”\n\nThere was no response from Israel or either of Libya’s two rival governments to the report, which also said administration officials have discussed offering incentives such as free housing and possibly a financial stipend to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza for the North African country.\n\nAn official told the US network that it remains unclear where one million Palestinians from Gaza could be settled in the largely lawless Libya, which has been plunged into chaos and division since the 2011 civil war in which longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed.\n\nThe NBC report also noted the logistical challenges involved in transporting one million people from Gaza to Libya, particularly with no airport in the Strip.\n\nUS President Donald Trump triggered global perplexity in early February by suggesting the US “take over” Gaza and turn it into a “Middle East Riviera” while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan, or other countries. He has since said, however, that no Gazans would be expelled.\n\nVisiting the Middle East this week, Trump said he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”: “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone. Let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.”\n\nWhile far-right ministers in Israel who have urged using the ongoing war with Hamas as an opportunity to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Strip lauded the plan, the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations rejected it outright.\n\nDespite public opposition among the region’s leaders, the government has moved forward with plans to encourage Palestinians to relocate, though The Times of Israelfoundno meaningful change in Israel’s exit policy for Gaza residents in recent months.\n\nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.
