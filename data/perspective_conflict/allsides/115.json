        "source_1": "Updated on:  June 15, 2025 / 2:05 PM CDT/ CBS Texas\n\nAuthorities call it a successful round up of child sex offenders, but it also shows how widespread the crime is in North Texas.\n\nThe Dallas FBI office and some of the 70 law enforcement agencies that participated announced the results of Operation Soteria Shield on Tuesday.\n\nThese are the faces of the 244 men and women charged with exploiting children for the purpose of sex trafficking or pornography.\n\nIt's the end of a month-long investigation by federal and local enforcement of a crime that authorities say is a year-round problem.\n\n\"The number of offenders arrested and the children rescued in this operation are stunning,\" said Jay Combs, the U.S. Attorney Eastern District of Texas. \"It's stunning to hear them repeated here.\"\n\nOperation Soteria Shield, which began in April, led to the rescue of 109 children.\n\n\"During this operation, many of the children recognized or rescued were previously unidentified,\" said Plano Police Department Assistant Chief Dan Curtis. \"They'd never been reported missing. They had never had their abuse known to authorities.\"\n\nThe operation not only led to arrests and rescues but also to the seizure of terabytes of child abuse sex material through a collaborative effort that started 10 years ago and now includes 70 Texas law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"What started as a small team with a bold idea has grown into something very powerful,\" said Greg Willis, the Collin County District Attorney.\n\nIn a lot of these cases, authorities said the sex offenders never actually meet their victims face-to-face but use technology to coerce them into sending explicit images and videos.\n\nThe head of the Dallas FBI office said the methods used don't just involve social media but also online gaming systems.\n\n\"So I think for many of us, I'll speak for my generation, we were raised to be concerned about faceless strangers that might try to contact us or cause harm on the street, but we've moved past that,\" said Joseph Rothrock, the Dallas FBI Special Agent in Charge. \"Again, predators have access to our children in our home through technology.\"\n\nAuthorities urge families to use parental controls on any devices kids use and be aware that there are more faces like these still out there.\n\nJ.D.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTexas law enforcement agencies rescued 109 children and arrested 244 suspected offenders in a large-scale operation targeting online child exploitation, said the FBI.\n\nThe monthlong initiative, called Operation Soteria Shield, was conducted in April by more than 70 Texas law enforcement agencies and federal partners, across the north of the state.\n\nThe operation aimed to identify and free victims of abuse, while seizing key digital evidence of these crimes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Dallas Division said in a press release Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities confirmed that the operation—jointly managed by the FBI Dallas Division, Dallas Police Department, Plano Police Department, Wylie Police Department, and Garland Police Department—resulted in the confiscation of terabytes of illicit data and ongoing forensic analysis that may lead to more arrests and the discovery of additional victims.\n\nOnline child exploitation is an escalating threat as technology gives predators unprecedented access to minors in their own homes. The scope and success of Operation Soteria Shield highlights both the widespread nature of these crimes and the increasing need for coordinated law enforcement responses nationwide.\n\nOperation Soteria Shield engaged more than 70 agencies, including national organizations such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and local departments stretching from Dallas to Amarillo.\n\nThe FBI said NCMEC analysts provided \"vital intelligence and case coordination,\" which aided in the success of the operation.\n\nFBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said children's advocacy centers and prosecutors at the state and federal level were also involved in the initiative.\n\nOfficials seized 1,130 digital devices and over 213 terabytes of digital evidence during the operation.\n\nPlano Police Department Assistant Chief Dan Curtis said that many of the rescued children were previously unidentified and never reported missing.\n\nOfficials said, in many of these cases, online predators used technology such as social platforms and gaming networks to coerce minors into sharing explicit content, often without meeting their victims in person.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas announced that the operation has led to grand jury indictments for distributing child sexual abuse material and sexually exploiting children to produce it.\n\nFBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock, in a statement:\"We shared a common goal: to rescue children from abuse and exploitation. This was not an easy operation, but a necessary one. The FBI and our law enforcement partners will continue to protect the children in our communities, and we will hold child predators accountable for their crimes.\"\n\nDallas Police Chief Daniel C. Comeaux, in a statement:\"Operation Soteria Shield was a massive team effort and a powerful reminder of what we can accomplish when we unite around one clear mission: protecting our kids and holding offenders accountable.\"\n\nPlano Police Chief Ed Drain, in a statement:\"Online exploitation of children is one of the most insidious crimes. It reaches into every community, crosses every boundary, and leaves lasting harm on its youngest victims. Operation Soteria Shield brought together an unprecedented level of collaboration and resolve to confront this crisis head-on.\"\n\nJay Combs, Eastern District of Texas Acting U.S. Attorney, in a statement:\"The numbers of offenders arrested and children rescued in this operation are stunning. Behind every statistic, there is a child with dreams and the right to live a life free from sexual exploitation. We are committed to teaming with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute these cases with urgency and ferocity in order to protect our children.\"\n\nAuthorities are continuing to analyze seized devices and digital material, with further arrests and victim identifications possible as investigations develop.\n\nDo you have a story thatNewsweekshould be covering?

        "source_3": "A monthlong investigation in Texas snared 244 alleged online child-sex predators, the FBI and other agencies announced at a June 10 news conference in Dallas.\n\n“We’re taking them off the street and not stopping,” FBI Director Kash Patel wrote in a social mediapost.\n\nThe FBI Dallas office’s special agent in charge, R. Joseph Rothrock,told reportersthat a common goal united more than 70 federal, state, and local agencies: “to rescue children from abuse and exploitation.”\n\nThis marks the second month in a row that the FBI has announced large-scale arrests of alleged online predators. Such cases are considered high priority for President Donald Trump’s Justice Department,Patel said last month, as he announced that 205 suspects were arrested in a nationwide sweep called Operation Restore Justice.\n\nThe Texas-based investigation, dubbed Operation Soteria Shield, “rescued 109 children” and gathered “terabytes of illicit data,” the FBI said, adding that electronic devices are being further analyzed. The new evidence could lead to additional arrests or identifying victims.\n\nOfficials did not disclose details of the charges. However, at the news conference, they displayed names and photographs of the defendants. Silhouettes served as placeholders for 22 suspects for whom photographs were unavailable; some were juveniles and at least one remained unnamed pending arrest.\n\nThe effort demonstrates the agency’s commitment “to relentlessly pursue those who prey on children and to ensure that survivors are no longer silenced or hiding in the shadows,” FBI Dallas said.\n\nIt welcomed remarks from Texas police chiefs whose departments participated in the operation.\n\nDallas Police Chief Daniel C. Comeaux said the operation, which began in April, marshaled “a massive team effort.” His department serves as the lead agency for the North Texas Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.\n\nWylie Police Chief Anthony Henderson said: “The trauma inflicted by these crimes runs deep, affecting not only the victims, but also their families and entire communities.”\n\n“With every arrest made and every child protected, the operation moves us closer to a safer community,” Henderson said."
