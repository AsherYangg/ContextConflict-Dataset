        "source_1": "PresidentDonald Trumpannounced Thursday that theWhite Housewill celebrate America’s 250th anniversary with an epic athletic event on its grounds—but the actual sport will have few ties to this country. Unlike hosting a US-originating pastime likebaseball,basketball, orour version of football, the president will welcome a mixed martial arts competition, he told a crowd at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Is the president’s embrace of a discipline rooted in Asia and Brazil over a sport from this country another sign that his so-called “America First”stance is continuing to soften? Or is he just leaning into a sport he’s familiar with as a longtime casino proprietor?\n\nDetails on the event remain scarce. According tomultiple news outlets, Donald Trump told a Des Moines crowd, “We’re going to have a UFC fight—think of this—on the grounds of the White House.” That initialism is a reference to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a MMA promotions company now owned bytalent-agency-turned-combat-sports conglomerate Endeavor, a public company led bybig-ticket Democrat donorandvocalKamala HarrissupporterAri Emanuel.\n\nOf course, Emanuel isn’t who most folks think of, if or when they mull the UFC. That honor goes toDana White,a longtimeTrump hype manemployed by the fight company as president and CEO (he also reportedly holds a small ownership stake). White,who was caught on tapein an alleged domestic violence incident with wifeAnne Whitein 2022, has praised Trump as “the toughest, most resilient guy I’ve ever met in my life” and “the legitimate, ultimate American badass of all time,” words that cynics might assume have swayed Trump’s interest in his company.\n\nCEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship Dana White speaks during an election night event for Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIf the White House match happens, it will be an incredible turnaround for a sport that was banned in most states until just a couple of decades ago. The UFC—whichonce marketed itselfas “no holds barred,” although rulesdo indeed existtoday—faced bipartisan ire when Republican Senator John McCain sentletters to governors of all 50 statesin 1996 encouraging its ban. It was “barbaric,” “not a sport,” and “human cockfighting,” McCain wrote. In consequence, theUFC went darkin the US until the turn of the millennium, when those laws werelifted state by state.\n\nThe now-shuttered Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was the site of a UFC bout soon after, in 2001, so if this White House match goes off, it won’t be the president’s first time hosting one of the company’s events. “We’re going to have some incredible events, some professional events, some amateur events. But the UFC fight is going to be a big deal, too,”Trump toldassembled Iowans Thursday. “It’s going to be a championship fight, full fight, like 20,000 to 25,000 people and we’re going to do that as part of ‘250’ also.”\n\nAccording to a pool report quoting White House press secretaryKaroline Leavitt, the president is “dead serious” about the plan to host this globally inspired sporting event at the White House, even as more expressly and traditionally American pursuits like baseball (the modern version of which was invented in New York in the 1840s), basketball (Massachusetts, 1890s), and American football (East Coast, 1960s) go unmentioned.\n\nIt’s news sure to rile former Trump supporters likeTucker Carlson, whohas recently complainedthat Trump’s promise to focus on American excellence and boosterism appears to be slipping. \"Let’s focus on my country, where I was born,” Carlson said last month, as he chewed over America’sbombing of Iran. Is Trump’s desire to mark America’s founding with a new, non-traditional, and foreign-born sport a yet another sign—likehis softened stance on undocumented farmworkers—that the president is sneakily, incrementally going multicultural and woke? If so, this is certainly a July 4 for the history books.\n\nMeet the Self-Described “MAGA Rambo” Challenging Lindsey Graham\n\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Lawyer: “I Love Representing the Underdog”\n\nInside theCelebrity Boat TripThat Was All Over Your Feeds\n\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story ofLiam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\n\nThe Real Problem WithSydney Sweeney’s American Eagle Ad",

        "source_3": "President Trump stunningly announced that there would be a UFC fight with up to 25,000 spectators at the White House within the next year to celebrate America’s upcoming 250th birthday.\n\n“Does anybody watch UFC? The great Dana White? We’re going to have a UFC fight. We’re going to have a UFC fight — think of this — on the grounds of the White House,” Trump said in a speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.\n\nA bloody cage match on the White House grounds is likely to draw criticism from the Republican leader’s political opponents — while offering the president an unconventional way of connecting to the public.\n\n“We have a lot of land there, we’re going to build a little — we’re not, Dana is going to do it. Dana is great, one of a kind — going to be UFC fight, championship fight, full fight, like 20,000 to 25,000 people, and we’re going to do that as part of ‘250,’” Trump, 79, said in the speech.\n\nTrump is a friend of White, the CEO of UFC, aka the Ultimate Fighting Championship, andattended a fight last month in Newark, New Jersey, between Merab Dvalishvili and Sean O’Malley.\n\nShortly after winning the Nov. 5 election, Trump attended a UFC event at New York’s Madison Square Garden with Elon Musk, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son Donald Trump Jr. and Kid Rock.\n\nTrump’s visit to Iowa was planned as a kickoff to the America250 events ahead of next year’s Independence Day, but doubled as acelebration of the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Actthat passed hours earlier, fulfilling campaign pledges to cut taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nTrump, who spoke for more than an hour, had spent much of the prior night twisting the arms of holdout House Republicans going into the final vote.\n\n“We’re going to have some incredible events, some professional events, some amateur events. But the UFC fight is going to be a big deal, too,” Trump said, forecasting plans for “every one of our national parks, battlefields and historic sites” to host “special events in honor of ‘America250.’”\n\nTrump said there would be a “Great American State Fair” in Iowa and at fairgrounds across the country, “culminating in a giant patriotic festival next summer on the National Mall, featuring exhibits from all 50 states.”\n\nHe said he also would be “officially opening the National Garden of American heroes, a vast outdoor park featuring statues of the greatest Americans who ever lived.”\n\nA sporting event called the Patriot Games, meanwhile, would feature “top high school athletes from all 50 states,” he said.\n\n“Exactly one year from tomorrow, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of America’s founding with a birthday party the likes of which you have never seen before,” Trump touted.\n\n“Together, we’re going to ensure that America’s 250th anniversary is the single greatest year in the history of our country.”\n\nThe Big Apple will also host a huge event for the nation’s semiquincentennial bash.Sail4th 250will be a six-day celebration featuring more than 30 tall ships from international militaries, a Blue Angels flight show, displays of rare historical documents and more."
