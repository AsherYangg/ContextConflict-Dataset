        "source_1": "The decision comes a day after a trade court blocked the majority of Trump tariffs because it circumvented Congress.\n\nA federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated (PDF) US President Donald Trump’s tariffs a day after a trade court ruled that it exceeded the authorities granted to the president.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington temporarily blocked the lower court’s decision on Thursday, but provided no reasoning for the decision, only giving the plaintiffs until June 5th to respond.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted an emergency motion from the Trump administration arguing that a halt is “critical for the country’s national security”.\n\n“You can assume, even if we lose tariff cases, we will find another way,” trade adviser Peter Navarro said.\n\nThe administration has not made a final decision and it could wait to impose any plans after a federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of Trump’s tariffs following a trade court ruling to immediately block them, the report added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday evening that the White House is considering imposing tariffs of 15 percent for 150 days on US trade partners by invoking a little known provision of the 1974 Trade Act, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe stop gap measure would buy the Trump administration time to draft individual tariff schemes for its trading partners using a separate provision of the same law targeting unfair trade practices, the report said.\n\nThe process would be lengthy and complex, but would put the tariffs on a much stronger legal foundation. Discussions are reportedly still underway at the White House, according to the Journal.\n\nWednesday’s surprise rulingby the US Court of International Trade had threatened to halt or delay Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on most US trading partners, as well as import levies on goods from Canada, Mexico and China related to his accusation that the three countries were facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the US.\n\nThe International Court of Trade said tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is typically used to address issues of national emergencies rather than addressing the national debt, were considered overreach.\n\nExperts said the IEEPA, which was passed in 1977, is narrow in scope and targets specific countries, US-designated “terrorist organisations”, or gang activity pegged to specific instances. The US, for example, used the law to seize property belonging to the government of Iran during the hostage crisis in 1979 and the property of drug traffickers in Colombia in 1995.\n\n“The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn’t say anything at all about tariffs,” Bruce Fain, a former US associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan, told Al Jazeera.\n\nFein added that there is a statute, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows tariffs in the event of a national emergency. However, he said, it requires a study by the commerce secretary and can only be imposed on a product-by-product basis.\n\nDespite the appeal court’s reprieve, Wednesday’s decision has been viewed as a blow to the administration’s economic agenda that has thus far led to declining consumer confidence and the US losing its top credit rating.\n\nExperts believe that, ultimately,the tariffs will not last.\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday, lawyer Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote that, if the trade court’s decision “is upheld, importers should eventually be able to get a refund of [IEEPA] tariffs paid to date. But the government will probably seek to avoid paying refunds until appeals are exhausted.″\n\n“The power to decide the level of tariffs resides with Congress. The IEEPA doesn’t even mention raising tariffs. And it was actually passed in order to narrow the president’s authority. Now the president is using it to rewrite the tariff schedule for the whole world,” Greg Schaffer, professor of international law at Georgetown Law School, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US trade court did not weigh in on tariffs put in place by other laws, such as the Trade Expansion Act – the law used to justify tariffs on steel, aluminium, and automobiles.\n\nThere are additional targets for similar narrow tariffs, such aspharmaceuticals from China.In April, the White House announced that the US Department of Commerce launched an investigation to see if the US reliance on China for active ingredients in key medications posed a national security threat, thus warranting tariffs.\n\n“This is not an issue of whether the president can impose tariffs,” said Fein, the former associate deputy attorney general. “He can under the 1962 act after there’s a study and after showing that it’s not arbitrary and capricious and that it’s a product-by-product, not a country-by-country approach.”\n\n“If he doesn’t like that, he can ask Congress to amend the statute.”",
        "source_2": "A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower court ruling that struck down most of former President Trump’s tariffs, allowing them to remain in effect for now.\n\nThe lower court had ruled the tariffs unlawful, saying Trump misused emergency powers for a trade issue that should be handled by Congress.\n\nThe case is under review, with responses from both sides due in early June.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs can stay in effect, for now, after afederal appeals court temporarily paused a lower court’s decisionthat struck down most of the tariffs imposed.Trump placed tariffs on countries, including China, Canada, Mexico and others, using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nA three-judge panel with the United States Court of International Traderuled Wednesdaythat Trump’s tariffs are unlawful and the 10% reciprocal tariffs are too far-reaching. The court said what Trump called an “emergency” did not meet the legal definition under that law.\n\nInstead, the court said it was really a trade issue rather than a national emergency, and Congress should handle that trade policy, not the president alone.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration requested that the federal appeals court step in and issue an injunction to stop the ruling from taking effect. The federal appeals court said the lower court’s judgment is “temporarily stayed,” meaning it is on hold while the court takes time to look over the case.\n\n“The United States moves to consolidate its appeals from those rulings and has applied for this court to stay the judgment and injunction pending these appeals and for an immediate administrative stay while the court considers that motion,” the appeals court said in the order.\n\nThe court told the plaintiffs, which include some U.S. businesses, that they have one week to respond to the administration’s request. After the plaintiffs respond, the Trump administration has until June 9 to reply.\n\n“This is merely a procedural step as the court considers the government’s request for a longer stay pending appeal,” Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the business plaintiffs, said in a statement,as reported by CNBC. “We are confident the Federal Circuit will ultimately deny the government’s motion shortly thereafter, recognizing the irreparable harm these tariffs inflict on our clients,” Schwab said.\n\nBefore the federal appeals court decision came down Thursday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavittposted to X, saying:\n\n“America cannot function if President Trump has his sensitive diplomatic and trade negotiations derailed by activist judges. This judicial overreach must be stopped.”\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly responded to the ruling.\n\nA federal appeals court decision to temporarily allow President Trump's tariffs to remain in effect during ongoing legal challenges highlights a conflict over the legal limits of presidential authority in trade policy, with potential consequences for global commerce, domestic industries, and the balance of powers in U.S. government.\n\nDetermining whether the president can unilaterally impose tariffs under emergency powers has implications for the separation of powers between the executive branch and Congress, as underscored by court decisions questioning if the International Emergency Economic Powers Act provides such authority (according to multiple news sources).\n\nThe continuation or reversal of these tariffs directly affects international trade relations, businesses, supply chains, and consumer prices, as reported by Reuters and Associated Press, with uncertainty influencing markets and negotiations with trading partners.\n\nThe rapid sequence of conflicting court rulings injects notable ambiguity into the future of U.S. trade policy, creating challenges for businesses, foreign governments, and legislative oversight, as described by experts and business groups in AP and CNBC reports.\n\nSynthesized coverage insights across204media outlets\n\nBusiness owners, particularly importers and small retailers, express frustration about the unpredictability of policy changes. The National Retail Federation and affected businesses highlight how rapidly changing tariff rulings complicate planning and can threaten survival. Local communities dependent on ports, trade, and related industries are feeling job and income pressure from both existing and potential tariffs.\n\nHistorically, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 had not been used to impose tariffs before President Trump invoked it. The power to set tariffs has traditionally belonged to Congress, though presidents have exercised increased authority over time, particularly during perceived emergencies. Previous use of emergency powers for tariffs has sparked debate about executive versus legislative authority.\n\n– Tariff: A tax imposed on imported goods. \n– IEEPA: International Emergency Economic Powers Act (1977), used by the president to declare national economic emergencies affecting foreign transactions. \n– Reciprocity: The idea that US tariffs should match those imposed by trading partners.\n– Administrative Stay: A court order temporarily pausing the effect of a lower court’s decision.\n\nAppeals court reinstates Trump tariffs a day after suspended\n\nAppeals Court Reinstates Most Of Trump's Tariffs For Now\n\nThe Trump administration lost a big ruling on tariffs.
