    "question": "How might the March decline in inflation to 2.4%, driven by falling energy prices but alongside sharply higher egg prices from bird flu, shape expectations for how President Trump’s tariffs (even with a 90-day pause) could affect prices in the months ahead?",

        "source_1": "Consumer price inflation eased more than expected in March as PresidentDonald Trumpprepared to launch tariffs against U.S. trading partners, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nTheconsumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in March, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core inflation ran at a 2.8% annual rate, having increased 0.1% for the month. That was the lowest rate for core inflation since March 2021.\n\nWall Street had been looking for headline inflation of 2.6% and core at 3%, according to the Dow Jones consensus.\n\nSlumping energy prices helped keep inflation tame, as a 6.3% drop in gasoline prices helped drive a 2.4% broader decline in the energy index. Food prices climbed 0.4% on the month. Egg prices rose another 5.9% and were up 60.4% from a year ago.\n\nMoreover, shelter prices, among the most stubborn components of inflation, increased just 0.2% in March and were up 4% on a 12-month basis, the smallest gain since November 2021. Used vehicle prices were off 0.7% while new vehicle costs increased just 0.1%, ahead of tariffs that are expected to hit the auto industry hard.\n\nAirline fares declined 5.3% in March and motor vehicle insurance dropped 0.8% and prescription drugs fell 2%.\n\nStock market futuresindicated a sharply lower open on Wall Street following the release, while Treasury yields also were negative.\n\nThe report comes a day afterTrump's stunning reversalof parts of his tariff plans as he announced a delay in some of the most aggressive of the duties put in place against dozens of nations. Instead, Trump let stand a 10% blanket levy on all imports announced last week and set a 90-day window during which the White House will negotiate the higher tariffs.\n\nWhile Trump campaigned on bringing down inflation, progress had been slow to start 2025.\n\nThe president nevertheless has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Central bank officials have expressed a reluctance to move with so much policy uncertainty in the air, and market pricing indicates the Fed will wait until June before lowering rates again.\n\nThe nature ofthe tariffshas led most economists to expect a significant bump in inflation, though that's less clear now that Trump has opened the negotiation window.\n\n\"Today's softer than expected CPI release feels backward looking given the large changes to trade policy seen in recent days,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Going forward the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft.\"\n\nFutures market pricing after the CPI report indicated little change in market expectations for interest rates, with traders pricing in three or four cuts by the end of the year.\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

        "source_2": "Inflation was more moderate than economists expected last month, according to data released Thursday morning, though President Donald Trump’stariffthreats could drive consumer prices back up in a major fashion.\n\nConsumer prices declined 0.1% month-over-month and rose 2.4% year-over-year in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index, compared to consensus economist forecasts of a 2.6% annual rise in prices and a 0.1% month-over-month increase, according to FactSet data.\n\nThat is the lowest annual CPI inflation reading since September’s 2.4%.\n\nCore CPI inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, was 2.8% annually in March and 0.1% month-over-month, compared to estimates of 3% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nThat’s the lowest core CPI inflation, considered by manypolicymakersto be a more accurate measure of the trajectory of prices, since March 2021.\n\nGasoline and airline fares declined 6% and 5%, respectively, driving much of the lower inflation, reflective oflowerconsumer demand for travel amid recession fears.\n\nFresh off of a historic day as Trump stood down on his most aggressive tariff plans, at least temporarily, stocks and bonds didn’t budge after the milder-than-expected inflation reading. Futures for the S&P 500 baseline stock index maintained a roughly 2% loss, while yields for the benchmark 10-year Treasury were flat at just above 4.3%.\n\nHow Trump’s oft-changing tariffs will impact inflation. Even after Trump’s 90-day tariff pause on the more than 10% tariffs on many non-China trade partners, the effective tariff rate will still increase by 15 percentage points, Goldman Sachs economists estimated Wednesday. That will still translate into substantially higher prices for foreign goods. On Tuesday, Goldman forecasted the core CPI rate would jump to 3.7% by the end of 2025, which would be a level not seen since March 2024.\n\n“The shock to consumer goods prices from tariff hikes is not reflected yet,” Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings’ chief economist, wrote in emailed comments, explaining companies “had been sucking in huge amounts of imports in January and February in advance of tariff hikes.”\n\nInflation most directly affects the economy as higher prices weigh on consumer confidence and can weaken growth, but it also pays a pivotal role in monetary policy. At its most recent meeting, Federal Reserve officials “judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs,”accordingto minutes released Wednesday. That could sway the Fed away from lowering interest rates, which would lower borrowing costs and help stimulate the economy, as it operates on a dual mandate to simultaneously keep prices stable and the economy afloat.",
        "source_3": "US inflation was lower than expected in March — despite President Trump’s launch of sweeping tariff wars — but some experts warned that higher prices are likely in the coming months.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% over the past 12 months through March, below expectations of a 2.6% rise and beneathlast month’s 2.8%figure, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 2.8% — also below projections of a 3% jump and February’s 3.1% figure, according to the government data. It’s the smallest rise in core inflation since March 2021.\n\nEnergy prices led the cooldown, with gasoline prices plunging 6.3% in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nPrices for airline fares, car insurance and used cars and trucks also fell, while prices picked up for food, medical care, clothing and new vehicles.\n\n“That was nice, but don’t get used to it,” Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, said in a note. “Consumers, businesses and even the Federal Reserve are bracing for higher prices in the months ahead.”\n\n“All this is looking in the rear-view mirror. With both inflation and the overall economy, uncertainty abounds about what might be lurking around the bend,” McBride added.\n\nTheDow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all tumbled, after making massive strides on Wednesday — with theDow soaring nearly 3,000 points— after Trump announced a 90-day pause on nearly all tariffs.\n\nThe pause was a welcome reprieve for Wall Street, since panicked investors had led a massive week-long sell-off as they worried the taxes could reheat inflation and even trigger a recession, with the Dow losing nearly 5,000 points.\n\nIn March, Trump launched a 20% levy on China and a 25% tax on steel and aluminum imports, and he also halted planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe data was weaker than expected “with a relatively high slate of tariffs that took effect in March,” Rick Gardner, chief investment officer at RGA Investments, told The Post. But “there is a lag time between when the tariffs take effect and when consumers may start to see price increases.”\n\nAnd the latest inflation report does not account for Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs – a 10% baseline tax on nearly all imports and much harsher rates on many nations – and his recent 90-day pause on them.\n\n“Thursday’s CPI is for March, which is backward looking and doesn’t tell the market much about how the recent tariffs, albeit many of them [are] on pause, are affecting consumer prices,” Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said in a note.\n\n“The next two to three CPI reports over the coming months will take on greater importance,” Weinand added.\n\nTrump made his “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2, so that impact won’t be reflected in the data until next month’s inflation report.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, has signaled that the central bank is in “wait-and-see” mode before making any moves to change policy, despite pressure from the president to slash interest rates immediately.\n\nMost recently, Fed minutes from last month’s meeting revealed policymakers arefavoring a “cautious approach”that could keep rates higher for longer if inflation persists, or cut rates if the economy shows significant signs of weakening.\n\nBut investors started to up their odds of an interest rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee’s next meeting in May, with 17.5% betting on a quarter-point rate cut, according to CME FedWatch.\n\nLast month, central bankers kept interest rates unchanged in their current 4.25% to 4.5% range as theyforecast two rate cutsin the second half of this year."
