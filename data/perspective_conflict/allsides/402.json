The US president-elect told reporters later in the day that he wouldn’t rule out using military force to take control of Greenland.\n\nAddressing Trump’s comments in an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she did not believe that the United States will use military or economic power to secure control over Greenland. Frederiksen repeated that she welcomed the U.S. taking a greater interest in the Arctic region, but that it would have to be done in a way that is “respectful” of the Greenland population.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., center, smiles after arriving in Nuuk, Greenland, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025.

(Emil Stach/Ritzau Scanpix via AP)\n\nPresident-electDonald Trumptold residents of Greenland that “we’re going to treat you well” as his oldest son visited the mineral-rich Danish territory that’s home to a large U.S. military base, heightening speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to acquire it.\n\nThe president-elect later told a news conferencehe wouldn’t rule out using military forceor economic coercion to take control of Greenland, saying that “we need it for national security.”\n\nEarlier, the president-elect posted a video showing a TRUMP-emblazoned plane landing in Nuuk, the Arctic territory’s capital, in a landscape of snow-capped peaks and fjords.\n\n“Don Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland,” Trump wrote. “The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength, and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen. MAGA. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” Supporters later posted video of Trump speaking by phone to locals.\n\nIn a statement, Greenland’s government said Donald Trump Jr.’s visit was taking place “as a private individual” and not as an official visit, and Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him.\n\nTrump Jr. was in Greenland for a day trip to shoot video content for podcasting, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. Trump’s eldest son has become a prominent player in his father’s political movement and has served on his presidential transition team.\n\nMininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary of the ministry of statehood and foreign affairs, told The Associated Press that authorities were informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours. Neither Trump Jr.’s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials had requested a meeting, Kleist said.\n\nThe visit nonetheless had political overtones. The president-elect has voiced a desire — also expressed during his first presidency — to acquire the territory inthe Arctic, an area of strategic importance for the U.S, China, Russia and others.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future of Greenland would be decided by Greenland, and called the United States Denmark’s most important ally. “Greenland is not for sale,” Frederiksen said, adding that “we need to stay calm and stick to our principles”\n\nTheworld’s largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is 80% covered by an ice sheet. The autonomous territory has some 56,000 residents, most of them Indigenous Inuit people.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister Múte Egede has called for independence from Denmark, saying in a New Year’s speech that it would be a way for Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States, insisting that the island is not for sale.\n\nIndependence has become a key issue ahead of an election for the Greenlandic parliament. A date hasn’t been set, but it must take place no later than April 6.\n\nAaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of the Danish parliament, told the AP she has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the U.S. and said she hears the same sentiment from her constituents.\n\n“Most people don’t want it,” she said. “I think some people find it quite disrespectful. And the way it has been done, and just the fact that you’re saying that you can buy another country.”\n\nA former colony of Denmark, Greenland in 1979 gained self-rule, which is exercises through its parliament. Copenhagen still exercises control over Greenland’s foreign and defense policy. A treaty with the United States, with the U.S. base, also gives Washington say over the territory’s defense.\n\nDenmark’s King Frederik Xhas been asserting the kingdom’s rights to Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean. The king’s power is mostly symbolic.\n\nLast month, the king by royal decree changed Denmark’s coat of arms to include fields that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented by a silver bear with red tongue. The royal announcement noted that since 1194, the royal coat of arms “visually symbolized the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state and the monarch.”\n\n“We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark,” the king said in his New Year’s address, adding: “all the way to Greenland.”\n\nThe idea of the U.S. purchasing Greenland — located near the North American landmass — is not new, with early attempts in the late 19th century.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump mused about purchasing Greenland. Hecanceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019after the prime minister dismissed the idea.\n\nReviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: “For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.
