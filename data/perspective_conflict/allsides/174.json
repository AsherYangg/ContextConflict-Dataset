Sharaa was named head of a new interim government in January and has worked since then to build international legitimacy.\n\nIt was an early moment of diplomacy in Trump's first official overseas trip, which has otherwise been defined by business deals. Trumparrived in Saudi Arabiaaccompanied by a massive delegation of top U.S. CEOs and members of his Cabinet who reflect the array of business and security interests underpinning relations with the kingdom.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2025.Alex Brandon/APhide caption\n\nSaudi Arabia is no longer just a key oil producer in the world, but a country in transition looking to diversify its economy,position itself as a mediatoron the global stage and spur new industries that can create millions of jobs for young Saudis. To do this, Saudi Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salmanis rebranding the country and embarking on a massive social transformation that's liberalizing society, all while looking to the U.S. to maintain its role as security guarantor in the region.\n\nThis intertwining calculus was on display in the deals inked during Trump's visit to Riyadh. Trump called the crown prince an \"incredible man\" and said he wants to strengthen the bilateral relationship. \"It is more powerful than ever before -- and by the way, it will remain that way. We don't go in and out like other people,\" Trump said.\n\nThe trip kicked off with the crown prince greeting the president with a handshake on the tarmac as Trump stepped off Air Force One. That's a departure from former President Joe Biden, who in 2022 avoided shaking hands with the crown prince on camera, instead giving him afist bump.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman greets President Trump in Riyadh on May 13, 2025.Brendan Smialowski/AFPhide caption\n\nThat was viewed as a snub in the region, but at home was derided as capitulation after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that U.S. intelligence assessed had been approved by the crown prince. Biden had raised the issue of human rights during that trip, something Trump is not expected to bring up in conversation.\n\nTrump said gains in the region can come from within, not through the interventions of \"nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits\" from the West.\n\nHe said a new generation of leaders in the Middle East was \"transcending the ancient conflicts of tired divisions of the past\" and defining the region \"by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds, are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. We don't want that,\" he said.\n\nThis is very much a trip underpinned bybig business deals, and drew a roster of who's-who to Riyadh, including Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, the CEOs of AI companies like Palantir and OpenAI, chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Google, Coca-Cola, Boeing and other major U.S. weapons manufacturers, as well as asset management firms like Blackstone and BlackRock.\n\nTrump had announced Saudi Arabia as his first overseas state visit after a call with the crown prince in January, during which Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would investat least $600 billioninto the U.S. over the next four years.\n\nThe White House announced some of those pledges on Tuesday, including:\n\nElon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are directed to greet the Saudi Crown Prince at the Royal Court in Riyadh on May 13, 2025.Brendan Smialowski/AFPhide caption\n\nDuring most of Biden's term, sales of precision-guided munitions had been paused over concerns about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. The Saudis now see an opportunity to upgrade all of their systems and for additional weaponry and more high-tech planes, said Elizabeth Dent, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\n\"They see Trump as a businessman, as a very transactional diplomatic character, who if you're willing to name the right price of investment into the United States, he is willing to make concessions that other American presidents likely would not have,\" Dent said.\n\nThe crown prince also wants to build a civilian nuclear program with U.S. technology, and those discussions are moving ahead under Trump.\n\nThat's something that had been tied to Saudi Arabia establishing relations with Israel, but the kingdom has been clear it will not move ahead with normalization without Israel stopping its war in Gaza and creating a pathway to Palestinian statehood. The current far-right government in Israel is rejecting both, and has been planning an even larger-scale invasion of Gaza amid a devastating blockade that is starving people there, according tothe latest findingsby independent experts on famine.\n\nTrump said it was his \"fervent hope, wish — and even my dream\" for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel by joining the Abraham Accords. \"I really think it's going to be something special. But you'll do it in your own time and that's what I want, that's what you want, and that's the way it's going to be,\" Trump said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Terminal of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh on Tuesday.Alex Brandon/APhide caption\n\nHuge amounts of money from the Gulf have flowed into Trump's orbit since he was first elected president nearly nine years ago.\n\nJust weeks ago, his son, Eric Trump, who runs the Trump Organization, was in the region for the launch of two new projects with a Saudi developer: A high-rise Trump hotel tower that will have the world's highest pool, and a sprawling Trump golf course with villas in Doha, Qatar. That's in addition to other Trump towers and projects underway in Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nWhile president, Trump's investments and assets are in a trust managed by his children. Still, these deals and others have drawn criticism.\n\nTrump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has previously secured a$2 billion investmentfrom Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — overseen by the Saudi crown prince. It helped Kushner launch his private equity fund just months after leaving the White House where he was adviser to Trump in his first term.\n\nMamoun Fandy, director of the London Global Strategy Institute think tank, said these family business deals compromise the image of the office Trump holds.\n\n\"In the past, the presidency used to cost the president his financial well-being, if you will, that most people have to declare their assets and make sure they are separated from his office,\" Fandy said. \"Now everything is conflated.\"\n\nThe latest gesture came from Qatar, which has offered the presidenta new Boeing jetto use while the aging Air Force One fleet is overhauled. When asked by reporters about this before heading to the Gulf on Monday, Trump said he appreciated the offer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman walk during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.Alex Brandon/APhide caption\n\n\"I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane,' \" he said.\n\nThe offer has drawn outrage by Democrats aghast at the suggestion of such a large gift from a foreign country.\n\nMeanwhile, investments from the Gulf keep coming. The latest deal included the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture called World Liberty Financial. It's co-founded by Zack Witkoff, whose father is Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Mideast. Just days ago, an Abu Dhabi firm used World Liberty's stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange, Binance.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters it's ridiculous to even suggest Trump is making money off being president.\n\n\"He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service, not just once, but twice,\" she said.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump did not speak extensively about the war in Gaza, where the health ministry says Israeli attacks have killed nearly 53,000 people, a third of them children. \"The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's team held direct talks with Hamas in Qatar, leading to the freeing ofIsraeli-American soldier and hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday. His release from Gaza is putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to return in earnest to negotiations to end the war, and change course on his government's plans to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip.\n\nArab Gulf states also want to see Trump's team give adequate time to Iran for negotiations over its nuclear enrichment and missile program. There's still a lot of uncertainty around the talks.\n\n\"The administration has given very inconsistent signals about whether, ultimately, it would agree to an arrangement in which Iran would be able to continue domestic enrichment,\" said Daniel Shapiro, a fellow with the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Mideast.\n\nIn his speech, Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran that would end its nuclear ambitions, but warned he would \"inflict massive, maximum pressure\" if Iran rejects a deal. \"This is an offer that will not last forever,\" Trump said.",
        "source_2": "May 13 (UPI) --U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpspoke during a U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum Tuesday after having touched down in Saudi Arabia aboardAir Force Oneon the first stop of four-day visit to the region, the first major overseas trip of his second term, with a focus on securing investment in the U.S. economy worth as much as $1 trillion.\n\nTrump went before the crowd at the event,broadcast by the White Houseand held in Riyadh as he thanked CrownPrince Mohammedbin Salman Al Saud, who was among the attendees, as were many members of Trump's Cabinet. He went on to praise the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and then moved in mentions of his administration's accomplishments since Trump retook office in January, which includes efforts in border patrol, military enlistment and the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump then went on to allege that food prices are down and there's \"no inflation,\" that nearly 500,00 new jobs have been created in \"weeks\" and touted the trade agreement recently made with Britian and the tariff agreement made over the weekend with China, among several other purported accomplishments he stressed were superior to what occurred before his presidency.\n\nTrump's speech then moved into the 2024 election, with a going-over of his electoral college win and investments companies have made in the United States since his second term began, and investments he further expects.\n\nTrump then pivoted to what he termed was an \"exhilarating period, right here in the Arabian Peninsula,\" and spoke of a \"transformation\" of Saudi Arabia that included an increase in \"towers\" and \"exhibits,\" World Cup soccer and Formula One racing, and that for the first time, a majority of the Saudi economy was not oil.\n\n\"Before our eyes a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump spoke of his take on how the Biden administration fared in the Middle East before his return, which included several purported slams and an allegation that it funded the Oct. 7Hamasattack on Israel.\n\nHe compared Saudi Arabia's direction to what he says is happening in Iran, a description that included failing infrastructure and a corrupt government, and then mentioned his administration's involvement in peace talks between countries currently in conflict. He also declared that neither Russia's War onUkraineor the Oct. 7 Hamas attack would have occurred if he was President as the time.\n\nTrump concluded the speech with a comparison between the current level of perceived economic expansion and growth in Saudi Arabia to the rest of the Middle East, to what he said has been launched in the United States, a \"Golden Age of America,\" said to be born of the influx of \"trillions and trillions\" of dollars and \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs. He closed with statement that with the \"help of the people of the Middle East and the people in this room,\" that the \"Golden Age of the Middle East can proceed right along side of us.\"\n\nThe White House alsoreleased a statement Tuesdaythat President Trump has secured a $600 billion investment commitment in Saudi Arabia that includes a $20 billion investment from the Saudi data center company DataVolt, and that companies such asGoogle,Uberand Oracle among others have made a commitment to invest $80 billion in \"cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries.\"\n\nThe financial pledge also is to include infrastructure deals with a group of American companies, who will take on projects like King Salman International Airport and King Salman Park among others, which is to total more than $2 billion in U.S. services exports. There's also to be an investment from the Shamekh IV Solutions intravenous solutions company to build a plant in Michigan, and exports from American companies focused on energy and aircraft that would total $19 billion.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump is scheduled toattend a summitof Gulf leaders before heading to Qatar and finally to the United Arab Emirates on Friday.\n\nAll three countries have deep pockets and state-run sovereign wealth funds with assets totaling more than $2.5 trillion that Trump could tap for his alternative plans for U.S. economic growth going forward.\n\nCrucially, no visit to Israel is included in his itinerary, although Trump has said he might detour to Turkey for Russia-Ukraine peace talks due to get underway there on Thursday if he felt his presence would be helpful.\n\nTrump said last week that an \"earth shattering\" announcement not related to trade trade was imminent.\n\nOne possibility is a proposal to rename the Persian Gulf \"the Arabian Gulf\" as an offering to the leaders of Arab capitals he is meeting on his visit.\n\nHowever, Sanam Vakil, director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program, told the BBC that Trump may be floating the idea to test the water in advance, given the consternation such a move would cause in Iran, which the gulf is named after.\n\nAnother possibility is renewed momentum toward a regional security alliance.\n\nHowever, Vakil said normalization of ties between the Arab countries and Israel was firmly off the table and would remain so as long as the war inGazacontinued.\n\nMeanwhile, an escalating row over plans for Trump to receive a gift of a$400 million luxury Boeing 747from the Qatar royal family for use as Air Force One -- which he has stressed would be owned by the United States and not him personally -- threatened to overshadow the trip.\n\nThe proposal was catching bipartisan flak, including from some of Trump's highest-profile MAGA backers, such as social media star Laura Loomer, who said it wouldbe \"a stain\" on his administrationif true.\n\n\"As someone who would take a bullet for Trump. I'm so disappointed,\" she said.\n\nThe White House said Monday it would be a government-to-government transaction, fully compliant with all U.S. laws, and dismissed questions over what Qatar might want from the United States in return.\n\nTrump has said the arrangement would be temporary while waiting for the delivery of two replacement aircraft on order from Boeing, however, it remains unclear if reports the aircraft would be passed onto his presidential library at the end of his term in January 2029 were accurate.\n\nHowever, security experts and government officials warned it posed major security risks.\n\nSen.Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said using the aircraft would \"poseimmense counterintelligence risksby granting a foreign nation potential access to sensitive systems and communications.\"\n\n\"This reckless disregard for national security and diplomatic propriety signals a dangerous willingness to barter American interests for personal gain. It is an affront to the office of the presidency and a betrayal of the trust placed in any U.S. leader to safeguard the nation's sovereignty,\" said Reed.",
        "source_3": "President Donald Trump’s week-long trip to the Middle East is expected to result in several economic and business deals as he attempts to shore up relationships with Gulf states in one of the first major international trips of his second term.\n\nTrump’s trip will take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, and the president isexpectedto pursuemajordeals and investments. Trump’s arrival in the region also mirrors his 2017 visit to the region, a trip that resulted in later diplomatic wins, such as the 2020Abraham Accordsthat normalized ties between Israel and several nations in the Arab world.\n\n“There will be some economic announcements that will take place. I can’t divulge what they will include now, but I can say that they have to do with aviation, defense and a lot have to do with security,” Dr. Majed al-Ansari, advisor to the Qatari Prime Minister and official spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.(RELATED: Trump Admin Wants To Accept Largest Gift From Foreign Government In US History: New Air Force One From Qatar)\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump boards Air Force One on May 12, 2025, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nThe Gulf states have enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Trump administration so far, and the president is reportedly aiming to score amassive$1 trillion investment deal with Saudi Arabia as the first win in his blitz across the Arabian Peninsula. Trump will arrive in the UAE on the heels of amassive$1.4 trillion investment from the nation finalized in March, targeting energy, artificial intelligence and semiconductors.\n\n“These kinds of visits are always the catalyst, and states use it as a way of pushing business deals, economic deals, pushing things that will take a long time,” al-Ansari told the DCNF. “Visits can facilitate these things, making their bureaucratic schedules in order to get things done.”\n\nQatar madeheadlinesrecently by their reported offering of a $400 million Boeing jet intended to serve as a replacement for the aging Air Force One. However, al-Ansari told the DCNF that the deal was not finalized yet and its fate remains unclear.\n\nTrumpdefendedthe deal, saying he would be “stupid” not to take the gift as Boeingcontinuesto push back its schedule for delivering a new Air Force One. Some critics have questioned the legality and ethics of the gift, but Attorney General Pam Bondireportedlydetermined that the arrangement is legal.\n\nAdditionally, Qatar has also been a mediator in the Israel-Hamas war, puttingforwardmultiple ceasefire deals with other Arab partners, with mixed success.\n\n“We spent over 20 years engaging with both sides,” al-Ansari told the DCNF. “We know the Israelis very well. We know the Palestinians, especially Hamas, very well. And we have went through countless mediations. So we’re working non-stop on this issue to try to create some kind of sustainable peace in that region.”\n\nIn the backdrop of the visit, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will lead a fourth round of negotiations with Iran in Oman on Sunday over its nuclear program,accordingto CNN. The Gulf states are a key allyalignedagainst Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, with member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) slowlyshiftingtowards the U.S. to act as a bulwark against Iranian aggression.\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia have foundthemselveson opposite sides of multiple conflicts in the Middle East, such as the Houthi rebellion in Yemen and the Syrian civil war.
