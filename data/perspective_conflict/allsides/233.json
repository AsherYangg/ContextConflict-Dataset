Read ourPrivacy notice\n\nTeslaCEO Elon Musk said he’d be reducing his time with the Department of Government Efficiency beginning next month after the company reported disappointing earnings, missing Wall Street expectations.\n\nMusk said in a Tuesday earnings call that he would begin stepping back from his Trump administration role next month and return his focus to his ailing EV brand.\n\nHe added that the ongoing Teslablowback, consisting of nationwide protests and violent vehicle attacks, left him with two options: Let the government’s waste and fraud continue or fight it.\n\n“I believe the right thing to do is to fight the waste and fraud and get the country back on the right track,” Musk said, announcing he’d be reducing his time with the agency in May, though he’s determined to stay on for a day or two a week for the remainder of Trump’s term.\n\n“Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company reported its lowest revenue since Q3 2021, with a double miss EPS of $0.27 vs an estimated $0.39 and revenue of $19.34 billion vs a $21.11 billion estimate.\n\nNet income fell 71 percent in the first quarter. The stock is down approximately 40 percent year-to-date, but rose four percent in the after-hours market.\n\nTesla had been plagued with a series of bad headlines ahead of earnings, with reports of declining sales, customers looking to ditch their cars and the price of used vehicles plummeting.\n\nAbout half of Americans viewMuskand the company negatively following his slashing of federal bureaucracy while running DOGE, a newCNBC pollfound. Violent attacks against the company have become so heightened that the Justice Department recently announced a Tesla investigative task force.\n\nHours before the call,climate activistsspray-painted a Tesla showroom in Manhattan with the words “F*** DOGE.”\n\nAs Musk spoke, he appeared to imply demonstrations against the brand were “paid for” and supported by those benefitting from “wasteful largesse.”\n\nShortly after President Donald Trump announced tariffs on China, the country imposed a retaliatory 125 percent tariff, forcing Tesla to stop taking new orders for its Model S and Model X from Chinese customers.\n\nMusk, who was initially considered one of the biggest winners of Trump’s tariffs, said he will continue to advise the president on financial policy but emphasized Trump’s decisions are his alone.\n\nThough the majority of a Tesla car is US-made, the company relies on parts from China and Mexico that are subject to tariffs. Company higher-ups acknowledged challenges as a result of the financial headwinds.\n\nLong-term investors are hoping the company pulls through on its artificial intelligence and robotic ambitions. Tesla is debuting its first robotaxi pilot in June in Austin, Texas.\n\n“Future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and...vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots,” Musk said Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Tesla’s auto sector accounts for most of the company’s overall revenue, and sales slumped 13 percent during the first three months of the year. Last week, Reuters reported Tesla delayed its US launch of an affordable electric vehicle, which was supposed to debut in the first half of the year.\n\n“I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world by far,” Musk continued, encouraging investors to look beyond the “bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us” and toward a “bright, shining citadel on a hill.”\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.\n\nTrump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.\n\n\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.\n\nMusk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".\n\n\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\".\n\nGeorg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire \"focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences\".\n\n\"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.\n\nTesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.\n\nThe firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

        "source_3": "Department of Government Efficiency chiefElon Musk told Tesla shareholderson Tuesday that he’s planning to dramatically cut back on his work for the Trump administration next month.\n\n“Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,” the electric car company CEO said on Tesla earnings call,according to Business Insider.\n\nMusk noted that “the major work of establishing” DOGE has been completed and that his “time allocation” to President Trump’s government cost-cutting initiative “will drop significantly” come May.\n\nThe billionaire tech tycoon, 53, indicated he’s interested in continuing to spend a day or two a week on government matters, “as long as it is useful,” and Trump is amenable to the idea.\n\nMusk was already widelyexpected to leave his postas the unofficial head of DOGE at the end of May, when his special government employee (SGE) status expires.\n\nPer federal regulations, SGEs can only work in government for 130 consecutive days — pegging May 30 as the Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink CEO’s last day as DOGE chief.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump told reporters that he wants Musk to be a part of his administration for“as long as possible”but acknowledged that the world’s richest man may want to spend more time on his business endeavors.\n\n“We’re in no rush, but there will be a point in time in which Elon’s going to have to leave,” Trump said on April 3, noting that Musk has “a number of companies to run.”\n\nThe president didn’t put an exact date on when Musk would be departing the administration but said he expects it will happen “in a few months.”\n\nTrump insisted that Musk is welcome to stay “as long as he likes.”\n\nTesla,which reported a 71% drop in net income for the quarterduring the earnings call, has been targeted by arsonists and vandals nationwide over Musk’s work with the Trump administration.\n\n“I think a great wrong is being done to the people of Tesla and to our customers,”Musk saidof the spate of vandalism in an interview with Fox News “Special Report” host Bret Baier last month.\n\n“I mean, Tesla’s a peaceful company that has made great cars, great products — that’s all it’s done,” he argued. “It hasn’t harmed anyone, and yet, people are committing violence.”"
