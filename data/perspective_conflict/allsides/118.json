        "source_1": "In the hours before Israeli warplanes carried out anattack on Iranearly Friday, raising fresh fears of all-out war in the region, President Donald Trump made clear it was an outcome he hoped to avoid.\n\n“I don’t want them going in because, I mean, that would blow it,”he said, referring to his diplomatic efforts to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe fact Israel went in anyway – without any US involvement, and against the president’s publicly stated wishes – now thrusts Trump into one of the biggest tests of his young presidency. After promising as a candidate to end foreign wars and keep American troops out of faraway conflicts, his ability to avoid getting mired in a new Middle East war now faces reality.\n\nBy his own telling, the strikes risk scuttling his attempts at diplomacy with Tehran, even as his top envoy Steve Witkoff was preparing to depart for Oman for another round of talks this weekend. Trump said early Friday his offer for diplomacy was still open, even as Iran vowed retribution for the killing of most of its top military leaders.\n\n“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done,” Trumpwrote on Truth Social.\n\n“Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!” the president went on. “There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.”\n\nWhether Trump and Witkoff are successful in using the Israeli strikes as leverage for their diplomatic efforts with Iran remained an open question. Even before the Israeli strike, Trump had begun expressing doubts about Tehran’s willingness to reach a deal. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Israel of “harsh punishment” following Friday’s attack.\n\nAfter months of simmering tension, the strikes could darken the pall over Trump’s already tense relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he urged as recently as this week tohold off on a strike. Trump did not mention Netanyahu in his statement, and there was no announcement of a phone call between the men.\n\nTrump offered no signals in the immediate aftermath of the attacks that he was prepared to use American military assets to help defend Israel from expected Iranian reprisal, as his predecessor Joe Biden did when Israel and Iran exchanged fire last year.\n\nInstead, the focus of public messaging from the US administration was on protecting the tens of thousands American personnel in the Middle East, and warning Iran not to drag the US into the fray.\n\nIn his warning to Iran on Friday, Trump implied the US would provide Israel with more military equipment – “Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come,” he wrote – but he stopped short of saying American resources would come to Israel’s defense. Trump is set to meet with his National Security Council later on Friday morning.\n\nWithout American assistance, Israel’s air defenses could be unable to withstand a major Iranian onslaught.\n\nTrump, who ran on a promise to end wars and bring about peace, will now find himself caught between competing crosscurrents from within his own party. Many Republicans were quick to offer their support to Israel on Thursday, including Sen. Lindsey Graham – a longtime Iran hawk – who wrote on X: “Game on.”\n\nYet Trump has never quite adopted that strain of his party’s foreign policy, particularly in his second term. His administration is stacked with officials, starting with his vice president, who take a deeply skeptical view of US military involvement abroad without express American interests on the line.\n\nStill, for all the complicated dynamics for Trump to now sort through, the attack hardly came as a surprise to the president and his team.\n\nEven as he was speaking from the East Room on Thursday, the president and his aides were aware the strikes were likely coming soon, sources said, despite Trump’s repeated attempts at urging Netanyahu to hold off.\n\nAs the strikes were getting underway, Trump was appearing on the South Lawn at a congressional picnic. He returned to the West Wing afterward to huddle with top officials, according to a White House official and other sources.\n\nAfterward, a terse statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to put distance between the US and any role in the attack.\n\n“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” read the statement, which was distributed by the White House.\n\n“Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners,” Rubio continue. “Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”\n\nDevoid of even boilerplate language offering support for Israel and its defense, the statement made clear: this would be Israel’s conflict, not Trump’s.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

Early Friday morning, around 3:30am local time in Tehran, Israel launched a series of coordinated attacks against Iran, targeting military bases, top generals, and nuclear enrichment facilities. Over 200 Israeli aircrafttook partin the strikes on over 100 different targets. According to senior Iranian officials, at least six military bases around the capital of Tehranwere attacked,along withresidential homes in military compounds, defense and industrial compounds in Kermanshah and Isfahan, and radar facilities in Piranshahr. Israel also targeted key components of Iran’s nuclear program,strikingIran’s main enrichment facility inNatanzand a nuclear research center inTabriz, along with two military bases and an airport in the country’s northwest.\n\nThe operationrepresentsthe largest single-day attack on Iran since the 1980s. Israel targeted several nuclear scientists andkilledat least six in the attack, along withat least 20senior Iranian commanders, including four top generals: Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces; Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC air force; and Gholamali Rashid, commander of Iran’s central military headquarters.\n\nIsraelcalledthe attack “preemptive” because of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, saying intelligence indicated Iran had enough material to assemble 15 nuclear bombs. “Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuannouncedin a statement. “This operation will continue for as many days as it takes.” Israeli military officialssaidthat they had planned out 14 days of operations and expect the strikes to continue for several more days, at minimum.\n\nReports indicate that the operationhas been plannedfor eight months. Mossad, Israel’s intelligence service, has operatives on the ground in Iran conducting clandestine operations, includingsetting upa drone base within Iran near Tehran anddeployingprecision-guided weapons in open areas near Iranian surface-to-air missile systems sites.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneivowed“severe punishment” in response to the attack, and Iranhas already launchedover 100 retaliatory drone strikes against Israel. The Israeli Defense Forcesaidit has been intercepting drones over Syrian, Saudi Arabian, and Jordanian airspace. Jordan alsostatedthat it has intercepted Iranian drones. Meanwhile, Hezbollah — an Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon — affirmed its allegiance with Iran, butannouncedthat it would not initiate attacks against Israel.\n\nThe extent of the United States’s knowledge or participation in the attack is unclear. Secretary of State Marco Rubiosaidthat the U.S. was “not involved in the strikes” and that “Israel took unilateral action against Iran.” However, the U.S. partiallyevacuatedits embassy in Iraq yesterday afternoon, with some reportsindicatingthat the U.S. expected an imminent Israeli attack. Furthermore, President Donald Trumpsaidthat he was aware of the military operation beforehand andexpressed supportfor Israel’s strike.\n\n“The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it,” the presidentsaidon Truth Social. “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”\n\nSeveral international leaders called for de-escalation in the immediate aftermath. “This was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate,” said NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Additionally, representatives forSaudi Arabia,Turkey, andJapanall condemned Israel’s attack.\n\nThe situationis ongoing, and further updates are expected throughout the day and weekend.\n\nIn today’s special edition, we’ll cover what the left, right, and international writers are saying about Israel’s attack on Iran. Then, I’ll give my take.\n\nIn Common Dreams, Juan Cole saidTrump “must condemn — not support — this brazen and unlawful military campaign.”\n\n“Netanyahu launched the strikes to thwart the peace negotiations being conducted with Iran by President Donald J. Trump’s administration via Oman, striking a day before the next talks were scheduled to take place. Trump had signaled repeatedly that he did not want the Israelis to attack, but Netanyahu appears to hold to the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) theory of the president’s behavior. He pointedly thanked Trump in his address to the nation, clearly hoping that Iran might take some action against America in response and so draw Trump into a war he clearly does not want,” Cole wrote. “Ironically, Trump himself paved the way to this war by trashing the 2015 nuclear deal concluded by the UN Security Council with Iran, which effectively blocked Iran from ever militarizing its program.”\n\n“Netanyahu was likely to some extent wagging the dog with this attack, since his governmental coalition is in danger of falling apart over the issue of the conscription of Ultra-Orthodox Jews, most of whom support Netanyahu,” Cole said. “A war with Iran is therefore Netanyahu’s double attempt to thwart the outbreak of peace between Iran and the U.S. and to thwart attempts to bring his government down domestically through a vote of no confidence… It is, however, unlikely that Israeli attacks can do more than set back Iran’s uranium enrichment program, since the country has a big establishment by now of nuclear scientists and it has its own uranium, and the know-how it has built up cannot likely be extinguished.”\n\nIn The Atlantic, Graeme Wood wrote about“why Israel struck now.”\n\n“Israel has been contemplating an attack like this for two decades. Why was last night different from every other night? Israel claims that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon (‘nine atomic bombs,’ Netanyahu said). That claim is nearly unverifiable, but it’s worth noting general trends that might have made Iran’s decision to go imminently nuclear more likely,” Wood said. “For at least two decades, the decision to go nuclear has been political rather than technical. Iran had the know-how. Its leaders just needed to decide that a nuclear bomb was worth the risk. And recently the calculation around that decision has shifted.”\n\n“Why, then, did Iran not make a mad rush for a nuclear weapon? Because it already had the immunity that a nuclear weapon would confer — and because as long as it didn’t have a nuclear weapon, it could use its threat of getting a bomb to extract concessions from America and its allies,” Wood wrote. “Circumstances have changed, and the country that changed them is Israel. It did so by piercing that immunity repeatedly, by attacking Iranian soldiers abroad, by humiliating and killing Iran’s proxies, and most of all by attacking it openly on its own hitherto sacrosanct territory. The Axis of Resistance wobbled, and by failing to do anything to steady it, Iran largely lost its deterrent power.”\n\nThe New York Post editorial board wrote“Israel is serving the entire world — taking huge risks to stop Iran from going nuclear.”\n\n“Good for Israel, acting as it has before (the 1967 war, the takedown of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program in 1981 and strikes on Syria in 2007) to preempt a clear existential threat to its continued existence,” the board said. “No serious player on the world stage can honestly deny that Tehran has been on its final run gaining nuclear weapons, and while some will quibble about whether the regime intended to use nukes to destroy ‘the Little Satan’ (as it has now called Israel for five decades), Jerusalem could hardly afford to take the chance.”\n\n“Tehran will hit back hard, and the IDF can’t be remotely confident it will intercept every drone and missile as it has the last two times. Israel must expect to hurt, hoping that the pain is survivable and simply the necessary price for fending off extinction. The rest of the Middle East, indeed the world, gets to free-ride on Israel’s bold self-defense: The IDF is moving to take out what would’ve been a menace to everyone else, including those foolish enough to think Iran is an ally,” the board wrote. “Iran’s strategy failed; we can only pray that Israel’s strikes do everything they need to.”\n\nIn The American Conservative, Jude Russo argued“this is not our war.”\n\n“It’s difficult to escape the sense that it didn’t have to be this way. The U.S.–Iran dealmaking process had shown promise at various points, and it remains obscure what changed between then and now,” Russo said. “What will happen next? I doubt that anyone at this point will openly say that the U.S. should commit to an increased troop presence in the Middle East to support Israeli operations against the Islamic Republic; Donald Trump in particular knows that a fresh ground war is political poison. No, we’ll start with air support, and maybe some bunker-busters, because, for all its vaunted military-industrial base, somehow Israel just can’t make a bunker-buster big enough to get to those reactors.”\n\n“And if we were to pursue regime-change, who would replace the ayatollahs? The shah, whose family’s police state was so hated that Khomeini seemed preferable? The [Mojahedin Organization of Iran’s] bizarre mix of Islamism and Marxism? A miraculous, autochthonous secular liberal democracy with Western-style human rights norms? None of these options seems both likely and desirable. Each would demand American support up to and including direct military intervention,” Russo wrote. “While the course we are on staves off the already distant prospect of Iranian hegemony, it will egg on Islamic terrorism and tempt hostile action on the sea lanes as Iran and its proxies seek leverage against their enemies. If the conflict is inevitable, the American message must be clear: This is not our war.”\n\nIn The Jerusalem Post, Yaakov Katz said“Israel had a window of opportunity to attack Iran and it was right to use it.”\n\n“From a military perspective, there is little question that Israel was right to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. It took advantage of a unique window of opportunity that stemmed from three primary factors. The first was the degradation of Iran’s regional proxies. For years, when the issue of attacking Iran would come up around the cabinet table, one of the main arguments against it was the retaliation Israel would face from Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and Iranian forces in Syria. That concern is no longer what it once was,” Katz wrote. “The second factor was operational capability — whether Israel can actually pull off such a strike… Penetrating fortified sites remains a challenge, but there is reason to believe Israel has the means.”\n\n“The third factor was the change in Washington. While President Donald Trump said he preferred a diplomatic deal with Iran, negotiations have stalled… We now know that Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were coordinated and that the comments coming out of Washington, that a deal might still be possible, were part of a planned ruse to put the Iranians to sleep,” Katz said. “The window of opportunity needed to be used since it was not going to remain open indefinitely. The more time passes, the more Iran will rebuild — its air defenses, its proxies, and its offensive capabilities.”\n\nIn Al Jazeera, Belén Fernández asked“as Israel strikes Iran, what happened to ‘America First’?”\n\n“Israel, of course, thrives on perpetual upheaval and mass killing, all the while portraying itself as the victim of the folks it is slaughtering and otherwise antagonising. True to form, the Israelis have now cast Iran as the aggressor, with the country’s nonexistent nuclear weapons allegedly posing a ‘threat to Israel’s very survival,’” Fernández wrote. “Unlike Iran, Israel does happen to possess nuclear weapons — which just renders the whole situation all the more flammable. But for Netanyahu, at least, keeping the region in flames is a means of saving his own skin from domestic opposition and embroilment in various corruption charges.”\n\n“By launching a so-called ‘preemptive strike’ on Iran, then, Israel has effectively preempted the prospect of any sort of peaceful solution to the issue of whether or not the Iranians should be permitted to pursue a civilian nuclear enrichment programme,” Fernández said. “And yet the at least tacit endorsement extended by Trump for today’s attacks on Iran would seem to call into question American priorities — and raise the possibility that the US is instead putting ‘Israel First.’”\n\nReminder: “My take” is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion.

        "source_3": "WASHINGTON — President Trump told The Post Friday that he knewIsrael would strike Iranif the theocratic regime didn’t quickly agree to a revised nuclear deal with the US.\n\n“I always knew the date,” the president said in a brief phone interview. “Because I know everything. I know everything. I know everything.\n\n“I gave them 60 days and they didn’t meet it,” Trump went on. “Today’s 61, you know. Today’s day 61.”\n\nThe president had never publicly revealed the 60-day deadline — though its existence had been reported by Israeli media — until after Israel launched Thursday’s attack, and had been coy on whether he fully supported giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the green light to strike.\n\nIn a video statement Friday, Netanyahu said Israel alerted US about the strike in advance.\n\n“They knew about the attack,” he said. “What will they do now? I leave that to President Trump.”\n\nThe first sign that a significant operation was afoot came Wednesday, when non-essential US personnel were told to leave several outposts in the region.\n\nTrump had stressed that he wanted to reach a deal diplomatically first — but if that failed, he had warned in May that “we could actually blow [the centrifuges] up.”\n\nTrump hosted Netanyahu at the White House on April 7, just over two months before Israeli forces launched devastating attacks targeting top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran responded by launching 100 drones back at Israel, which the Israel Defense Forces said had been intercepted.\n\nAsked whether Netanyahu provided him with intelligence showing the progress of Iran’s nuclear program and whether the 60-day window was mutually agreed on, Trump said, “I know what’s going on. Someone informed me of it.”\n\nThe US has been pressing Iran to abandon its nuclear enrichment program altogether in return for re-entering the global economy.\n\nVice President JD Vance said in May that the optimum deal would be for Iran to halt its nuclear program and “the complete cessation of any chance that they can get a nuclear weapon.”\n\nBut Tehran had been unwilling to come to that agreement, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying on June 4: “Who are you to tell us whether we should have a nuclear program or not?”\n\n“They had a great chance to make a deal. Iran did,” Trump said Friday. “They had a great chance to make a deal and they didn’t make it.”\n\nThe president indicated earlier in the day that the US was still willing to make a deal with Tehran — with another round of indirect talks set for this weekend.\n\n“I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!”\n\n“There has already been great death and destruction,” Trump added in a separate post, “but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.\n\n“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.”"
