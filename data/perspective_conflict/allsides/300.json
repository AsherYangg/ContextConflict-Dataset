Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student activist detained by U.S. authorities for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, can challenge his detention's legality, but the case must be heard in New Jersey rather than New York or Louisiana, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nJudge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled that New Jersey was the appropriate venue since Khalil was first detained there when his legal team filed the lawsuit.\n\nThe new ruling comes after Khalil, 30, a legal U.S. resident with no criminal record,released a new statement from jail following his controversial arrest.\n\nKhalil described himself as a \"political prisoner\" in a new letter dictated from anICEdetention center in Jena, Louisiana.\n\nKhalil's arrestis a test case for the policies of PresidentDonald Trump, who has pledged to crack down on pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses and called it \"the first arrest of many to come.\"\n\nIt has been condemned by human rights advocates and students who say it is a challenge to the right to protest and freedom of speech. His detention also sparked largestreet protestsin New York, demanding his release.\n\nIn his ruling, Furman called the case \"exceptional\", stressing the need for a thorough legal review to determine whether the government acted unlawfully or exercised its authority in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.\n\nFederal authorities defended Mahmoud Khalil's transfer to Louisiana, claiming it was due to a lack of detention center beds in the New York metro area and a bedbug infestation at a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\nKhalil's legal team argued the move was \"retaliatory,\" aimed at separating him from his lawyers and placing him in a jurisdiction where judges might be more favorable to the Trump administration's legal arguments.\n\nGovernment lawyers previously said that if the case wasn't transferred to Louisiana, New Jersey would also be an appropriate venue.\n\nSecretary of StateMarco Rubiohas invoked a rarely used statute granting him broad authority to deport individuals deemed to pose \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nThe White House has accused Mahmoud Khalil of \"siding with terrorists\" but has yet to provide evidence supporting the claim. President Donald Trump described Khalil's case as \"the first of many to come.\"\n\nKhalil, a graduate student in international affairs, represented student activists in negotiations with Columbia University over Gaza war protests. The Trump administration is moving swiftly to set an example with Columbia as it pressures universities to take stronger action against allegations of anti-Jewish bias on college campuses.\n\nKhalil said in his letter:\"I am writing to you from a detention facility in Louisiana, where I wake to cold mornings and spend long days witnessing the quiet injustices faced by many who are denied legal protections.\n\n\"My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night.\"\n\nKhalil's wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, called Furman's order a \"first step\" in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union:\"His unlawful and unjust detention cannot stand. We will not stop fighting until he is home with me,\" said Abdalla, a dentist and U.S. citizen who is pregnant with their first child.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking on CBS News:\"We're going to keep doing it...these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges... Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings, that's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"\n\n\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"\n\nKhalil awaits a legal decision regarding the government's accusations as he tries to fight expulsion.\n\nReporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nThis is a developing news story and will be updated as more information is available.\n\nUpdate: 3/19/25, 12:50 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate: 3/19/25, 1:18 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor atNewsweekbased in North Carolina.

        "source_3": "Anti-Israel Columbia University protesterMahmoud Khalilhas called himself a “political prisoner” — while urging students to respond with even more protests.\n\n“My name is Mahmoud Khalil and I am a political prisoner,” Khalil said in a fiery letter written from his Louisiana immigration detention facility.\n\nKhalil, head of the hardline pro-Palestinian group Columbia University Apartheid Divest, called his arrest “a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”\n\nHe accused Columbia’s leaders of having “laid the groundwork for the US government to target me by arbitrarily disciplining pro-Palestinian students and allowing viral doxing campaigns — based on racism and disinformation — to go unchecked.”\n\n“If anything, my detention is a testament to the strength of the student movement in shifting public opinion toward Palestinian liberation,” he wrote.\n\n“In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.”\n\nColumbia University denies that leadership invited ICE agents onto campus but said law enforcement can enter campus property with a warrant.\n\nKhalil, 30, a permanent US resident, is being detained in Louisiana despite his lawyer’s petition to have him returned to New York where his eight-month-pregnant wife, who is an American citizen, lives.\n\nHe was arrested on March 8 by ICE and is facing deportation for leading activities the Trump administration says were “aligned to Hamas.”\n\nDetailing his arrest, Khalil claimed he and his wife were “accosted” on their way home from dinner by DHS agents “who refused to provide a warrant,” he wrote.\n\n“Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed me and forced me into an unmarked car,” he said.\n\nKhalil said he spent a night at 26 Federal Plaza — ICE’s HQ in Downtown Manhattan — before being transferred to a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and then taken to Louisiana.\n\nColumbia has been slammed over disruptive pro-Palestinian protests, with Jewish students saying they created a hostile atmosphere.\n\nPresident Trump accused students of participating in “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity.”Shortly before Khalil’s arrest, the Trump administration froze $400 million in grants to the Morningside Heights school over campus antisemitism.\n\nColumbia responded last week by expelling and suspending many students.The White House has defended the move.\n\n“This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organizations that have killed Americans,” said Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.\n\nA federal judge this week blocked Khalil’s deportation from the US after his lawyers fought for his immediate release while the court reviews his petition arguing his arrest was illegal.\n\nKhalil separately sued to block Columbia from turning over protesters’ student records to Congress."
