        "source_1": "Resolution that would block tariffs passes 51-48 in Senate, in vote that shows Republican unease over president’s plans\n\nSeveral Republican senators joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policyjust hours afterhe announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners.\n\nIn a 51-48 vote, fourRepublicans– Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure. Democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl Trump is using to justify tariffs on Canada.\n\nWhile Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, introduced in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday, did not include additional levies on Canada, the Senate vote amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of the president’sescalating global trade warwith allies and enemies alike.\n\n“Tariffs will hurt our families. Canada is not an enemy,” the Democratic senator Tim Kaine, the bill’s sponsor, said in a floor speech on Wednesday. “Let’s not label an ally as an enemy. Let’s not impose punishing costs on American families at a time they can’t afford it. Let’s not hurt American small businesses. Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.”\n\nRepublicans have expressed varying degrees of unease over Trump’s clampdown on free trade – once a pillar of conservative orthodoxy – but few were willing to cross him, and many GOP leaders and supporters, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, were in the Rose Garden on Wednesday – a day dubbed “liberation day” by the president – as a way ofchampioning the historic barrage of tariffson goods from overseas he believes will boost American manufacturing.\n\nThe Senate’s legislation has practically no chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Trump, but itshowed the limits of Republican supportfor Trump’s vision of remaking the US economy by restricting free trade. Many economists are warning that the plan could cause an economic contraction, and GOP senators are already watching with unease as Trump upends the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world.\n\nBefore the vote, the Senate majority leader, John Thune of South Dakota, urged Republicans to oppose the resolution, arguing that the tariffs were needed to “ensure that President Trump has the tools to combat the flow of fentanyl from all directions”.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, sent just before 1am ET on Wednesday, Trump assailed the four GOP senators who had expressed opposition to his tariffs, imploring them to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight theDemocratswild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl”.\n\nHe vowed not to sign the measure if it reached his desk.\n\nDefending her vote, Collins said that the tariffs would hurt working families in her state of Maine, which shares a long border with Canada.\n\n“The price hikes that will happen for Maine families, every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank, if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful,” she said in a Wednesday floor speech. “And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.”\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\n\nShe also argued that fentanyl from Canada was not a major threat to the US, as Trump’s national emergency claims. “The fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border,” she said.\n\nDemocrats argued that Americans were turning against Trump’s agenda, pointing to a string of strong performances by their party in recent special elections that included a consequential victory in a Wisconsin state supreme court race on Tuesday night.\n\n“The American people are seeing how bad Trump is,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a floor speech. “Tariffs is a good part of it. And they are not supporting people like Elon Musk and those who supportDonald Trump.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.\n\n“Republicans can’t keep ducking this – it’s time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,” hewroteon X.",
        "source_2": "Just hours after President Donald Trump announced massive new tariffs on nearly all imports to the United States, a bipartisan group of senators made the first push to stop the most nonsensical part of Trump's global trade war.\n\nWith a 51–48 vote, the Senate approved a resolution to block Trump's tariffs onimports from Canada, which he imposed by declaring an economic emergency in early February. The measure to cancel that emergency declaration, sponsored by Sens. Tim Kaine (D–Va.) and Rand Paul (R–Ky.), faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled House and a near-certain veto if it reaches Trump's desk—but it also represents a small glimmer of hope, as it is the the first serious attempt by Congress at limiting the president's ability to smash free trade.\n\nPaul was joined by three other Republicans—former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.), as well as Sens. Susan Collins (R–Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R–Alaska)—and nearly all Democrats in voting to end the economic emergency.\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon, Paul outlined the many reasons for America to avoid a trade war with Canada. Perhaps the most important is also the most straightforward.\n\n\"We're not at war with Canada,\" Paul said. \"They're an ally that buys more of our stuff than almost any other country in the world.\"\n\nIndeed, it is quite insane to believe that the $400 billion in goods that crossed into America last year from its northern neighbor are some sort of threat. It is simply untrue that those imports constitute an emergency of some sort that demands dramatic executive action. And it's just silly to think that higher taxes on those imports will improve life on either side of the border.\n\nEven so, the resolution divided Republicans and passed despite some strong criticism that Trump delivered on social media in advance of the vote. Ina poston Tuesday night, Trump accused Kaine of trying to block \"our critical Tariffs on deadly Fentanyl.\"\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor, Paul mocked the idea that drug dealers would pay tariffs in the first place. He also stressed the economic damage that tariffs are likely to cause for American families, businesses, farmers, and more. He pointed to the fact that the Trump administrationbailed out farmersin the wake of the 2018 tariffs and called that \"an acknowledgement\" that tariffs create costs for Americans. He pointed to estimates showing that tariffs will increase the cost of homes,cars, andmany consumer goods.\n\n\"Are we going to have to bail out the car companies too? Are we going to have to bail out everybody who's going to be hurt by these tariffs? It's not a good idea,\" he said. \"Despite arguments to the contrary, Americans know tariffs are a tax they are going to have to pay.\"\n\nGetting the resolution through the House will be a challenge, thanks to some changes that House Republicanspushed through last month. A bill to undo a presidentially declared national emergency is supposed to be able to be brought directly to the House floor, but new rules adopted last month will force the Senate-passed resolution to take the scenic route through the House's committee process—a journey it is highly unlikely to complete anytime soon.\n\nMcConnell's decision to vote for the resolution was key to its passage.AsPoliticonoted when it broke the newsthat McConnell would vote for the resolution, his defection from Trump's tariff orthodoxy is not necessarily a surprise. He authoreda recent op-edin the LouisvilleCourier-Journalwarning that Kentucky \"can't afford the high cost of Trump's tariffs.\" Even so, the former majority leader's willingness to openly defy the president is a significant move—and one that may offer some political cover to other Republicans to do the same.\n\nIt's unlikely that will be enough to undo Trump's chaotic and self-destructive trade war. Still, it's something.\n\nStart your day withReason.

        "source_3": "The Senate passed a resolution on Wednesdayaiming to block President Trumpfrom imposing tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nThe measure cleared the upper chamber in a 51-48 vote, with a handful of Republicans joining all Democrats in support of the resolution, which seeks to terminate the national emergency on fentanyl smuggling that Trump declared in February and is using toimpose sweeping levieson imports from north of the border.\n\nRepublican Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted in favor of passing the measure.\n\nThe resolution is largely symbolic as Trump has already indicated that he “will never sign it.”\n\nThe measure is also likely to face stiff opposition in the GOP-controlled House. Paul, a co-sponsor of the bill, has said House members will “refuse” to bring it up for a vote through “trickery and chicanery.”\n\n“Symbolic or not, I think it’s an incredibly important argument,” Paul told Fox News “Special Report” host Bret Baier ahead of the vote. “Can the president raise taxes without the approval of Congress?”\n\n“Tariffs are taxes,” the Kentucky Republican argued.\n\n“There’s two arguments,” Paul continued. “One is the constitutional argument, but the second argument is an economic argument – tariffs are just bad.”\n\nDemocratic co-sponsor, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, joined Paul on “Special Report” and added: “We don’t like government by executive emergency declaration.”\n\nKaine argued that even if the tariffs are part of a larger Trump strategy to bring down levies against US products worldwide, the president shouldn’t be imposing tariffs to accomplish that.\n\n“If it was just a negotiation, the president has an avenue to negotiate,” the Virginia Democrat argued. “He negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement … President Trump can claim credit for that. He got nearly 90 votes for it in the Senate in his first term.”\n\n“He should use the tools that he created to find a resolution for any disputes that are legitimate, but for some reason, he’s bypassing that.”\n\nThe Senate vote came on the same day Trump announcednew “reciprocal” tariffson dozens of nations, including key allies such as European Union members, Japan and Israel.\n\nSen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who opposed the resolution, noted on the Senate floor that the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs “did not get applied to Canada.”\n\n“What we’re talking about here today, however, in Sen. Kaine’s resolution, is not about our trading relationship,” Crapo said, arguing that the vote was on “whether an emergency exists” related to fentanyl, which he adamantly believes does exist.\n\nTrump slammed Republicans supporting the resolution in a 1 a.m. Truth Social post Wednesday, arguing that “They are playing with the lives of the American people, and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels.”\n\n“The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely [Paul, McConnell, Collins and Murkowski], in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it,” the president added.\n\n“What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS?” he mused. “They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”"
