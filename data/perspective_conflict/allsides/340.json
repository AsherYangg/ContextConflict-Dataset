Annotation by NPRhide caption\n\nArabs and Muslims in the United States and abroad are criticizing a controversial video posted by President Trump on social media.\n\nThe apparently AI-generated video includes depictions of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza, and imagines scenes of destruction in Gaza transformed into a glitzy Riviera-style resort called \"TRUMP GAZA.\"\n\nThe video also shows children running out of the rubble into a world of palm trees and luxury buildings, and a towering golden statue of Trump. It depicts men in apparent drag dancing in bikinis on the beach, Trump enjoying a belly dancer and a man resembling Elon Musk being showered with cash in the form of U.S. currency.\n\nThe post comes weeks after Trump suggested the U.S. should take over the Gaza Strip and relocate Palestinians.\n\nIn Gaza, many residents have little to no internet service, but some who viewed the video expressed anger to NPR Gaza producer Anas Baba. Baba showed the video to 20-year-old Mohamed Abdelrahman who rejected the idea.\n\n\"We won't be lured by a few statues and money, leave us alone and let us rebuild our homes by ourselves,\" he told Baba.\n\nFaye Nemer, CEO and founder of the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) American Chamber of Commerce in Dearborn, Michigan, called the video \"offensive and counterproductive to peace talks\" in a statement to NPR.\n\nNemer, who says she voted for Trump in November, is calling on him to remove the video and issue a \"reconciliatory statement.\"\n\nWhen asked about the video and the president's messaging about Gaza, the White House reinforced his previous statements.\n\n\"As President Trump has said, Gaza in its current state is [uninhabitable] for any human being,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in the statement to NPR.\n\n\"President Trump is a visionary, and his plan to have the United States involved in Gaza's rebuilding will allow for Palestinians to resettle in new, beautiful communities while improving conditions in the region for generations to come,\" she added.",

It is currently in a ceasefire with Israel for the return of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, putting on hold the fighting since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which has devastated the Gaza Strip.\n\nA senior Hamas official toldNewsweek: \"Unfortunately, Trump is once again proposing ideas that do not take into account the cultures and interests of the people.\"\n\n\"The people of Gaza are looking forward to the day when they see Gaza rebuilt, economically revived and building a better future for its children, but this cannot succeed inside the big prison,\" said Basem Naim, spokesperson and Hamas Political Bureau member. \"We are not struggling to improve prison conditions, but to get rid of the prison and the jailer.\"\n\nThe AI-generated video shows Gaza transformed into something resembling a casino resort beside the beach. It includes a huge golden statue of Trump as well of scenes of bellydancers with beards, money being scattered in the air and an appearance by tech billionaire and Trump acolyteElon Musk.\n\nIt ends with a scene of Trump relaxing on a sun lounger alongside Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAt least 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's Gaza offensive, according to officials in the Hamas-run territory cited by the Associated Press. Hamas killed some 1,200 Israelis in the initial attack and took around 250 people hostage.\n\nHamas spokesperson Basem Naim:\"We are ready to cooperate with any party that wants to contribute to alleviating the suffering of the people of the Gaza Strip, rebuilding their country, and facilitating this noble mission on the basis of respecting the will of our people and their adherence to their land.\"\n\nVideo posted on Trump's social media accounts:\"Donald Trump is to set you free, bringing the light for all to see. No more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here.\"\n\nExchanges continue of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners during the shaky ceasefire. Whether or not Trump's plan for Gaza is intended to happen, it puts pressure on Arab countries to come up with a plan to stabilize Gaza — something that could also leave out Hamas.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBased in his hometown of Staten Island, New York City, Tom O'Connor is an award-winning Senior Writer of Foreign Policy and Deputy Editor of National Security and Foreign Policy at Newsweek, where he specializes in covering the Middle East, North Korea, China, Russia and other areas of international affairs, relations and conflict.

        "source_3": "President Donald Trump ruffled feathers after sharing an AI video of a potential future for war-torn Gaza, trolling the world with the video, showing resorts, Trump figurines, and money falling from the sky on the beach.\n\nThe video begins with individuals walking through the rubble in Gaza as words on the screen ask, “What’s next?” It then transforms into an oasis, with palm trees, skyscrapers, and a lively downtown.\n\nThe video appears to show an AI image of a man — likely Elon Musk — smiling on the beach while snacking on hummus. It then flashes to belly dancers with beards.\n\nAnother scene shows a child walking down the street with a giant gold balloon of Trump’s head. One can then see a yacht sitting off the coast of the beach.\n\nKids can be seen jumping up and down on the beach as money falls from the sky, before the video switches to a building, reading, “Trump Gaza.” Another scene shows a massive gold statue of Trump and a store selling what appears to be gold Trump souvenirs.\n\nAnother scene shows AI images of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu relaxing shirtless at a resort, sitting in beach chairs getting some sun.\n\nA post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump)\n\nPredictably, the post trigged countless meltdowns from both sides of the aisle, but some users on social media made it clear they could see the obvious trolling.\n\n“Trump Gaza is one of the most epic trolls I have seen to date,” one user on Xwrote. “Every leftist is losing their minds, screaming and yelling about it. It’s really delicious to watch!”\n\n“Trump is the master at trolling to get things accomplished,” anotherobserved.\n\n“I agree it is hilarious. And the most hilarious part about it is they don’t even realize it’s a troll,” anotherremarked.\n\nOthers, however — even those who support Trump — also made it clear they did not agree with the video.\n\nThis comes weeks after Trumpannouncedhis intention of rebuilding Gaza.\n\n“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it. And be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said. “Level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.”\n\nTrump said he envisioned “world people living there.”\n\n“The world’s people. I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place… And I think the entire world, representatives from all over the world, will be there,” he said, adding that it could be “the Riviera of the Middle East.”\n\n“This could be something that could be so magnificent,” he added."
