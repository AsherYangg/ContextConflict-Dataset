        "source_1": "Updated on:  November 19, 2024 / 4:21 AM EST/ CBS News\n\nPresidentBiden's decisionto allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-made and supplied missiles deeper into Russia — a major policy shift announced over the weekend after months of intense lobbying by Kyiv — has drawn a furious response from Moscow. While there was no immediate reaction directly from the man who launched the nearly three-year war on his neighboring nation, lawmakers aligned with President Vladimir Putin in Russia said Monday that the move was unacceptable and warned it could lead to a third world war.\n\nMr. Biden authorized Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to use American-made missiles with a range of about 190 miles, known as ATACMS, to strike deeper inside Russian territory than the Ukrainians have to date.\n\nSo far, Ukraine's attacks beyond the immediate border region inside Russia have been limited to non-U.S. — and much less potent—  weapons such as explosive drones. ATACMS are far more destructive and harder to shoot down as they head for their programmed targets.\n\nZelenskyy's government had been pushing Washington for permission to use the missiles for long-range attacks for some time but the Biden administration had been reluctant given concerns about potentially escalating the war.\n\nOver the weekend, however, the calculus apparently changed. The decision came almost 1,000 days into the full-scale war in Ukraine, and with Mr. Biden about two months away from handing over the White House keys to President-electTrump, who's seen as far less supportive of Ukraine's ambitionsof hanging onto all of its Russian-occupied territory.\n\nIt also came as Russiahit Ukraine with a devastating missile attack, highlighting Ukraine's desperate desire for the ability to target Russian weapons systems deeper inside the country before they're launched, which Zelenskyy has stressed for more than a year.\n\nMany of the Russian rockets launched Sunday targeted energy infrastructure but a ballistic missile carrying cluster munitions also struck a residential part of the northern city of Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and leaving more than 80 others wounded. Fresh strikes hit apartment buildings in the southern city of Odesa on Monday, killing at least eight people including a child, regional authorities said.\n\nResidents in Sumy were targeted as they slept, and Ukrainian officials called the Sunday missile and drone salvo one of the largest Russian attacks since the start of the war.\n\nWith the change in policy from the outgoing administration in Washington, Ukrainian forces will be able to retaliate harder, reaching further into Russia than ever before. Ukrainian forces have launched drone attacks into Russian territory, including targeting Moscow, for months, but with limited effect.\n\nZelenskyy welcomed the change in U.S. policy, saying \"strikes are not made with words… The missiles will speak for themselves.\"\n\nBut Ukraine's war-time leader also appeared to acknowledge the change in tack in Washington that Trump's second swearing-in will bring, with a far greater emphasis expected on striking a negotiated truce than on defending Ukraine's sovereign territory from unilateral annexation by Russia.\n\n\"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, adding that Ukraine \"must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.\"\n\nIn Moscow, meanwhile, senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky slammed Mr. Biden, accusing him of deciding \"to end his presidential term and go down in history as 'Bloody Joe'.\"\n\nSenator Vladimir Dzhabarov, meanwhile, told Russia's state-run Tass news agency that Biden's decision represented \"a very big step toward the beginning of the third world war.\"\n\nThe official newspaper of the Russian state, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, warned \"the madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain.\"\n\nPutin had personally warned against the eventuality previously,issuing a warning in Septemberthat U.S. permission for Ukraine to fire American-supplied long-range missiles at his country, \"would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries, are parties to the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nBut Putin himself has dramatically raised the stakes in the war since then, by overseeing the deployment of at least 11,000 North Korean troops to fight alongside Russian forces. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, they've joined the battle in Russia's western Kursk region, a significant portion of which Ukrainian troops occupied earlier this year in a surprise offensive.\n\nAccording to John Sullivan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia under both Trump and Mr. Biden, it may have been that move by Putin — \"really solidifying this as a global conflict with troops from North Korea fighting in Europe\" — that proved to be \"the last straw\" for the current U.S. president.\n\n\"It's been one escalation after another by Putin and, in my opinion, it was about time that the United States gave the Ukrainians the ability to defend themselves more completely,\" Sullivan said Monday on CBS Mornings.\n\nThe parameters of the permission granted to Ukraine for the use of the ATACMS haven't been confirmed, but according to reports, they include — and may be limited to — Ukraine using the missiles to attack Russian defensive positions in Kursk.\n\nJames Nixey, who heads the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think tank, said in an analysis Monday that the change in policy from Washington was \"not a game changer,\" especially if it included a limitation on where Ukraine can use the ATACMS.\n\n\"The relaxation of range limits for Ukraine's usage of US ATACMS follows the overall pattern of America's approach to this war: to make sure Ukraine cannot inflict significant damage on Russia… but to allow small increases in hardware provision and their usage over extended periods of time,\" he said. \"If it is true that the authorization for usage extends only to the Kursk region (and is therefore primarily directed at North Korean troops); then, again, this fits the pattern, and means the overall effects on the war will be negligible.\"\n\nImtiaz Tyab is a CBS News senior foreign correspondent based in London and reports for all platforms, including the \"CBS Evening News,\" \"CBS Mornings,\" \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and CBS News 24/7.

But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.”\n\nOn Sunday, theNew York TimesandWashington Postreported Biden had signed off on the move in response to North Korea deploying its troops in the conflict to support Russia. According to the Washington Post, Biden’s approval covers the use of the long-range American Army Tactical Missile System. The Times report noted that the missiles are initially expected to be used to repel a Russian offensive into Kursk—a Russian province that has partially been occupied by Ukrainian forces since August.\n\nRussia conducted a major strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odessa on Monday, killing at least eight people and injuring 39 others. Local authorities said four children were among the injured. The Odessa strikes were the latest in a series of major attacks launched by Russia into Ukraine in the past few days, primarily targeting the country’s power grid with drones and missiles.\n\nBiden Lets Ukraine Hit Russia With Long-Range Missiles—A Major Reversal After North Korea Joins Fight(Forbes)",

But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.'\n\nWhile some US officials have expressed skepticism that allowing long-range strikes will change the war's overall trajectory, the decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are making gains and possibly putKyivin a better negotiating position when and if ceasefire talks happen.\n\nBiden had remained opposed until now, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the US and other NATO members into direct conflict with Russia.\n\nBut North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year, which could have contributed to Biden changing his mind.\n\nA firefighter tackles a blaze in Mykolaiv following the drone strike, which killed two people overnight\n\nBiden allowing Volodymyr Zelensky's forces to use US-supplied missiles for strikes deep into Russia has raised expectations for the UK to follow suit with its Storm Shadow missiles (pictured: Prime Minister Keir Starmer)\n\nFormer senior NATO official Nicholas Williams has called the decision to allow Ukraine to fire US-supplied missiles into Russia 'significant in terms of the end game'.\n\n'It is significant. The Ukrainians may say it's too little too late but it's not too late to affect the end game,' he toldSky News.\n\nWilliams also said the decision was important for 'positioning Ukraine to not make the significant concessions which Russia wants in order to get peace'.\n\nThe introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.\n\nAs many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to US, South Korean and Ukrainian assessments.\n\nUS and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.\n\nIt is not clear if Trump will reverse Biden's decision when he takes office in January.\n\nThe surprise move from the White House came as Vladimir Putin's forces looked to freeze the population of Ukraine this winter.\n\nNATO was forced to scramble the Polish and Romanian air force as over 200 missiles and drones aimed to wipe out their eastern neighbour's energy grid, causing blackouts across the country.\n\nFirefighters work at the site of residential area hit by a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Lviv region, Ukraine November 17, 2024\n\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, firefighters put out the fire following a Russian rocket attack in Odesa region Ukraine, Sunday, November 17, 2024\n\nThe US-made MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (or ATACMS), designed and manufactured by the US defence company Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV),can fly up to 190 miles (roughly the same distance from London to the outer suburbs of Paris).\n\nTo put that into Ukrainian terms, the US missiles can reach from Ukrainian-controlled territory, well into Russia's borders, putting just about any target within Ukraine into Kyiv's crosshairs - including all of Crimea - which one analyst said could berendered 'militarily worthless'by the weapons, according to Business Insider.\n\nATACMS are launched by either Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) - both military trucks that double-up as missile launchers.\n\nThere are four variants of the ATACMS, two of which - the M39 Block I and the M39A1 Block I - contain 950 and 300 M74 bomblets respectively.\n\nEach of these bomblets is roughly the size of a baseball, and in the case of the M39, 950 are dispersed over an area of 677 feet in diameter - covering 360,000 square feet - making them highly effective at destroying groups of parked aircraft, ammunition dumps, aid defence systems - as well as gatherings of troops.\n\nOn Saturday night, Putin launched a devastating salvo of 120 cruise and ballistic missiles as well as 90 drones that killed at least 10.\n\nTerrified Ukrainian civilians were seen cowering in bomb shelters in Kyiv as while air defences shot down dozens of missiles 'severe damage' was inflicted on the power grid.\n\nThe country's energy operator DTEK announced emergency power cuts at around 7am UK time on Sunday morning affecting theKyiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions following overnight drone strikes.\n\nIt said shortly thereafter thermal power plants had been struck byPutin's latest fusillade. The level of damage was not immediately clear.\n\nAir defences were deployed overnight to intercept drones in Kyiv as residents were urged to take cover, while missiles bound for the west of the stricken country promptedNATOto send out its warplanes to assist.\n\n'Due to the massive attack by the Russian Federation using cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles on objects located, among others, in western Ukraine, Polish and allied [NATO] aircraft have begun operating in our airspace,' said a statement from the Polish operational command.\n\n'On-duty fighter pairs were scrambled, and the ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems reached the highest state of readiness. The steps taken are aimed at ensuring safety in areas bordering the threatened areas.'\n\nThe ferocious overnight attack took place 24 hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz extended an olive branch to Vladimir Putin for the first time since his illegal invasion.\n\nHe called the dictator on Friday in an attempt to open a dialogue on peace plans after Donald Trump was swept to power in the US promising to end the war.\n\nTrump is also reported to have held a call with Putin where he told him not to escalate the conflict before his inauguration in January - though the Kremlin denies this.\n\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, emergency services personnel work to extinguish a fire following a Russian rocket attack in Poltava region Ukraine, November 17, 2024\n\nThe ferocious overnight attack took place 24 hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (pictured) extended an olive branch to Vladimir Putin for the first time since his illegal invasion\n\nA handout photo released by the press service of the State Emergency Service (SES) of Ukraine shows Ukrainian rescuers working at the site of an air strike in Lviv, western Ukraine, November 17, 2024\n\nPolish PM Donald Tusk took aim at Scholz and Trump, tweeting on Sunday: 'No-one will stop Putin with phone calls.\n\n'The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine.\n\n'The next weeks will be decisive, not only for the war itself, but also for our future.'\n\nSir Keir Starmer said he had 'no plans' to speak to Mr Putin, urging 'full support as long as it takes' as he headed to a meeting of G20 leaders in Rio.\n\nThe Prime Minister Sir Keir told reporters: 'It's a matter for Chancellor Scholz who he speaks to. I have no plans to speak to Putin. We are coming up to the 1,000th day of this conflict on Tuesday.\n\n'That's 1,000 days of Russian aggression, 1,000 days of huge impact and sacrifice in relation to the Ukrainian people and recently we've seen the addition of North Korean troops working with Russians which does have serious implications.\n\n'I think on one hand it shows the desperation of Russia, bit it's got serious implications for European security [...] and for Indo-Pacific security and that's why I think we need to double down on shoring up our support for Ukraine and that's top of my agenda for the G20.\n\n'There's got to be full support as long as it takes and that certainly is top of my agenda, shoring up that further support for Ukraine.'\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
