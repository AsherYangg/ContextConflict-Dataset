        "source_1": "The manaccused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Rileywas found guilty of murder Wednesday in a case that became aflashpoint in the immigration debateearlier this year, ahead of the presidential election.\n\nJose Antonio Ibarra, 26, was convicted on three counts of felony murder and counts of malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape and “peeping Tom.” He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, in line with the request from prosecutors.\n\nThe decision was handed down by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard on the fourth dayof abench trial. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and did not testify in his own defense. Haggard delivered the verdict after taking a 20 minute break following closing arguments. Sobbing could be heard in the courtroom as he spoke. Riley’s parents, sister, stepfather, roommates and friends delivered victim impact statements before Ibarra was sentenced.\n\nAllyson Phillips, Riley’s mother, cried as she read her statement, saying that Ibarra had “robbed us all of our hopes and dreams with Laken.”\n\n“This monster took away our chances to see Laken graduate from nursing school,” Phillips said through tears. “He took away our ability to meet our future son-in-law. He destroyed our chances of meeting our grandchildren, and he took my best friend.”\n\n“He took away every beautiful memory we won’t ever be able to make with her again,” she said.\n\nPhillips urged the judge to sentence Ibarra to life without the possibility of parole “so that he never gets the chance to hurt anyone else ever again.”\n\nProsecutors said Ibarra accosted Rileywhile she was out for a run on the morning of Feb. 22. She was found dead in a forested area off the University of Georgia campus in Athens after her roommates called police when she did not return home.\n\nRiley’s killing drew national attention to the immigration debate after officials announced that Ibarra is a Venezuelan citizen who entered the United States illegally in 2022. Donald Trump and other Republicans met with Riley’s parents before a campaign rally in March and have used the case to call for stricter border policies.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors argued that Ibarra killed Riley after she fought off his attempt to rape her. The prosecutionpointed to DNA and other evidencethat they said linked Ibarra to Riley on the day of her murder.\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutor Sheila Ross told the judge that Riley “herself has given you all the evidence you need alone to find this man guilty of every single count in this indictment.”\n\nRoss said Riley fought her attacker and “it is a direct result of that fight that gives you all the physical evidence you need to convict.”\n\nDefense attorneys saidthat the evidence, while it shows that Riley was murdered, did not tie Ibarra to the killing without a reasonable doubt. Instead, they said Ibarra's brother, Diego Ibarra, could have killed the nursing student.\n\nKaitlyn Beck said in her closing argument that two alternative theories could not fully be ruled out: that Diego was responsible for Riley’s murder or that “Jose was an accomplice after the fact of the murder.”\n\nShe sought to undermine the prosecution’s evidence by suggesting the DNA was subject to contamination because Jose Ibarra and Diego Ibarra shared clothing and a bed.\n\nAfter the verdict, Republicans, who had seized on the case to call for more restrictive immigration policies, took to social media to comment on the decision.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that “although the pain and heartbreak will last forever, hopefully this can help bring some peace and closure to her wonderful family who fought for Justice, and to ensure that other families don’t have to go through what they have.”\n\n“We love you, Laken, and our hearts will always be with you,” he wrote. “It is time to secure our Border, and remove these criminals and thugs from our Country, so nothing like this can happen again!”\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said on X that while “we are glad that justice has been delivered on behalf of Laken Riley, we continue to mourn her loss with her family and friends and know that she should still be with us today.”\n\n“This criminal should never have been allowed to enter our country, and he certainly should not have been allowed to stay after shamelessly breaking our laws,” he wrote.\n\nPreviously, police said there was no indication Ibarra knew the victim and that he did not have a known extensive criminal background.\n\nDaniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.",

Ibarra did not visibly react.\n\nIbarra’s lawyers had argued that evidence linking him to Ms Riley’s death was “circumstantial”.\n\nMs Riley, who lived in the city of Athens, north-east Georgia, was found dead in a wooded area of the UGA campus after she did not return from her morning run.\n\nOn Wednesday, he was found guilty of all 10 counts, including felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury and aggravated assault with intent to rape.\n\nIbarra had waived his right to a jury trial, which means his case was heard and decided by county Judge H Patrick Haggard.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, as prosecutors had requested.\n\nProsecutors told the court Ibarra saw Riley while she was running on the UGA campus and \"bashed her skull in with a rock\".\n\nData from Ms Riley's smartwatch showed she had \"fought for her life, fought for her dignity\" only minutes after departing on her run, the trial heard.\n\nThe victim's struggle was \"fierce\", the lead prosecutor said. Ms Riley called police at 09:11 that morning and her heart stopped at 09:28, with no more movement from her device.\n\nIbarra's lawyer had argued there was a lack of proof connecting his client to Ms Riley's death.\n\nBut prosecutors said evidence showed that Ibarra's DNA was found under the nails of Ms Riley, indicating a struggle between them.\n\nThe trial, which began last Friday, included testimony from more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Ms Riley's former roommate and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.\n\nRosbeli Flores-Bello, Ibarra's former roommate, testified that the two had travelled together from New York City, where they had been living in a migrant shelter, to Georgia in search of work.\n\nIbarra entered the US illegally on 8 September 2022, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was later released for further processing.\n\nICE has said that Ibarra was arrested in New York City in September 2023 and was charged with \"acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation\".\n\nMs Riley's name became a rallying cry for conservatives as border security emerged as a defining issue in the White House race.\n\nIn March, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was heckled over her murder during his State of the Union address to Congress.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said it was the White House's fault that Ibarra was able to remain in the country despite his criminal record.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, often invoked Ms Riley's name on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump reacted to Ibarra's guilty verdict, writing on Truth Social that he hopes the outcome of the trial \"can bring some peace and closure to her wonderful family who fought for justice\".\n\nA National Institute of Justicestudy suggests that undocumented migrants in the US are arrested for violent and drug crimes at less than half the rate of native-born citizens.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nThe US military is preparing to activate troops as part of Trump's crackdown on street crime.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.",

Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and elected to have a bench trial, where the judge was the sole person responsible for a verdict and sentencing.\n\nIbarra was seen on police video with scratches during questioning by campus police, and another video spotted him disposing of a jacket that was believed to have her blood on it.\n\nHis former roommate and trial witness, Rosbeli Flores Bello, identified him in the video throwing away a jacket in a dumpster. She also confirmed that he received a taxpayer-funded flight from New York to Atlanta in September 2023.\n\nThe defense attempted to claim the evidence was “circumstantial” and did not link him to the crime despite witness testimony and digital forensics showing his cellphone linked close to Riley’s cellphone location.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRiley’s murder created a political firestorm of criticism of the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies. In the month following her death, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) confronted President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address when she demanded he say the student’s name. During the address, he did say Riley’s name in a garbled pronunciation.\n\nHer case led to more attention to other women across the country being murdered by violent migrants illegally coming across the border."
