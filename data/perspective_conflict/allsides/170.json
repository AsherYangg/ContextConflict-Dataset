At around 9 p.m. outside the museum, they were approached by a gunman who opened fire and killed them, officials said.\n\nThe suspect, whom DC police identified as 31-year-old Chicago native Elias Rodriguez, pretended to be a bystander after the shooting, an eyewitness told CNN.\n\nWhen police arrived, the man turned himself in and shouted “Free, Free Palestine” while being handcuffed. He is currently in custody, according to authorities. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the man “implied that he committed the offense.”\n\nThe shooting, which took place in the heart of the Hill, has shaken the Jewish community at a time of heightened global tensions, as US-led attempts to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas remain unsuccessful and fighting in Gaza continues.\n\nTensions are alsohigh across US college campuseswhere hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested amid polarized debates over the right to protest Israel’s military actions and accusations of antisemitism.\n\nRelated live story2 Israeli Embassy staff members killed outside Jewish museum in Washington, DC\n\n“We’ll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight our Jewish community,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters late Wednesday.\n\n“These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA,” President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nRodriguez is being interviewed by the DC Metropolitan Police and FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bonginosaid on X.\n\n“Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,” Bongino said.\n\nTed Deutch, the CEO of the AJC, described the shooting “an unspeaking act of violence.”\n\n“At this moment, as we await more information from the police about exactly what transpired, our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families,” he said.\n\nPolice Chief Smith said Rodriguez was allegedly seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before approaching a group of four and shooting two of them with a handgun.\n\nThe 31-year-old later retreated inside the museum, where he was eventually detained, according to Smith.\n\nAccording to Sara Marinuzzi, an eyewitness who spoke with CNN, the suspect “pretended to be a witness” once inside the building and waited for police to arrive for over 10 minutes before claiming responsibility for the attack.\n\nAnother witness, Paige Siegel, told CNN she heard Rodriguez say, “I did it for Gaza,” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nRodriguez, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night told officers, “I did this,” according to eyewitness Yoni Kalin.\n\nKalin was at the museum attending the same event organized by the AJC when he heard shots rang out. “At first I didn’t recognize them as gunshots,” he told CNN over the phone.\n\nMoments later, a man entered the museum appearing to be a witness, according to Kalin. He recalled the man sitting in the museum but not interacting with many people present at the event. Ten minutes later, when police entered the building, the man appeared to confess to shooting, telling officers, “I did this, I did this for Palestine,” according to Kalin.\n\n“It’s horrible,” Kalin said. “I just didn’t realize he was the perpetrator.”\n\nKalin added that between the shooting and the arrest, Rodriguez appeared shaken up. People approached the suspect to offer him water and check if he was okay, he said.\n\nKalin said around 50 people attended the event, which was organized to discuss how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions such as Gaza. He added that over 30 staffers from various embassies attended the event.\n\n“I’m still in shock,” Kalin told CNN. “I just hope we learn from this and just recognize that violence and terrorism doesn’t get us where we need to be” he added.\n\nWhen officers arrived on the scene minutes after the shooting, they found “one adult male and one adult female unconscious and not breathing,” Smith told reporters late Wednesday. “Both victims succumbed to their injuries,” she said.\n\n“We are shocked and horrified this morning by the news of the brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of two of our Embassy staff members in Washington,” the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in apost on Xin the early hours of Thursday.\n\n“We embrace the grieving families during this painful time and will continue to support them always,” the post read.\n\n“Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,” Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, also said in a social media postThursday. “The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.” Leiter earlier shared with reporters that the couple was about to be engaged.\n\n“A young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple,” he said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, expressed his condolences to the families of the young couple.\n\n“My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were suddenly cut short by a vile antisemitic murderer,” Netanyahu said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and the age of the suspect has been updated after police revised the number originally provided.\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Oren Liebermann, Jennifer Hansler, Kaanita Iyer and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.",

The gunman yelled, “Free, free Palestine” after he was arrested, Smith said.\n\n\"Once in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence,\" she explained at a press conference in Washington.\n\nThe man has been identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. Witnesses told the press he entered the museum visibly distressed after the shooting. Some of those present helped him without realising he was the suspected assailant.\n\nHe was initially detained by museum security, according to reports. The museum in downtown Washington is just steps away from the FBI field office.\n\nThe two victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event on helping Gazans at the museum together with two others at around 9 pm local time (3 am CEST) when the gunman opened fire on their group. One of the victims died on the scene while the other was taken to a local hospital in critical condition, but could not be saved, authorities said.\n\nThe identities of the victims were not immediately known. Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter said the two people killed were a young couple about to be engaged. The man \"purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\" Leiter said.\n\nFormer Israeli Ambassador to the US Mike Herzog told Israeli Army Radio that the woman killed was a US employee of the embassy and the man was Israeli.\n\nThe victims were later identified as embassy analyst Yaron Lischinsky — who also held German citizenship — and Sarah Milgrim, an employee in the embassy's public diplomacy department.\n\n\"I'm an ardent believer in the vision that was outlined in the Abraham Accords and believe that expanding the circle of peace with our Arab neighbors and pursuing regional cooperation is in the best interest of the State of Israel and the Middle East as a whole,\" Lischinsky wrote in his biography on LinkedIn.\n\nIn his bio, Lischinsky, 28, also said he was an \"advocate for interfaith dialogue and intercultural understanding\".\n\n\"My passion lies at the intersection of peacebuilding, religious engagement, and environmental work,\" Milgrim's bio on the same platform said.\n\n\"I am eager to contribute to organisations dedicated to bridging divides, promoting religious harmony, and advancing sustainable practices,\" Milgrim said about her work.\n\n\"Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,\" the Embassy of Israel to Washington said in a tribute on X on Thursday.\n\n\"The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss,\" the embassy added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Thursday that he was “shocked” by the “horrific, antisemitic” shooting.\n\n“We are witnessing the terrible price of antisemitism and wild incitement against Israel,” he said in a statement.\n\nDanny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, called the shooting a “depraved act of antisemitic terrorism.”\n\n“We are confident that the US authorities will take strong action against those responsible for this criminal act,” Danon said in a post on X. “Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas condemned the attack, stating on Thursday that \"there is and should be no place in our societies for hatred, extremism, or antisemitism.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on X he \"strongly condemned\" the \"despicable act\", adding that \"at the moment we must assume there was an antisemitic motive\".\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot called the shooting \"an abhorrent act of antisemitic barbarity,\" stating that \"nothing can justify such violence\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump denounced the attack as antisemitic, stating on his Truth Social platform that \"these horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, now.\"\n\n\"Hatred and radicalism have no place in the US,” Trump added.\n\n“This event was about humanitarian aid,” witness Yoni Kalin, who was at the Washington museum on Wednesday night, said.\n\n“How can we actually help both the people in Gaza and the people in Israel?
