(AP Photo/Baraa Anwer)\n\n▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to start working toward ending thewar in Ukraineand improving their diplomatic and economic ties, the two countries’ top diplomats said after talks that reflected an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press after the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow, to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation.\n\nHe stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and more work needs to be done.\n\nLavrov echoed Rubio’s remarks and told reporters that “the conversation was very useful.”\n\n“We not only listened, but also heard each other,” he said.\n\nTrump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and special Mideast envoy Steven Witkoff joined Rubio at the table, along with Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.\n\nNo Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country isslowly but steadily losing groundagainst more numerous Russian troops in a grinding war that began nearly three years ago.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he postponed his own trip to the kingdom scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nEuropean allies have alsoexpressed concernsthat they are being sidelined.\n\nTrump showed little patience for Ukraine’s objections to being excluded from the talks. He said repeatedly that Ukraine’s leaders never should have allowed the war to begin, suggesting the country should have been willing to make concessions to Russia before the 2022 invasion.\n\n“Today I heard, ‘Oh, well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you been there for three years. You should have ended it three years” ago, Trump said duringa news conference at his Florida residence. “You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”\n\nTies between Russia and the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in decades in recent years — a rift that has been widening ever since Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and only worsened after Moscow’s full-scale invasion.\n\nThe U.S., along with European nations, imposed araft of sanctionson Russia in an effort to damage its economy. And embassies in Washington and Moscow have been hit hard by expulsions of large numbers of diplomats, as well as other restrictions.\n\nRubio said Tuesday that ending the war in Ukraine could “unlock the door” for “incredible opportunities” to partner with the Russians on issues of common interest “that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.”\n\nHis comments were further evidence of the remarkable U.S. reversal on Russia after years in which Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, led international efforts to isolate Moscow.\n\nTuesday’s meeting was meant to pave the way for a summit between Trump and Putin. After the talks ended, Ushakov and Waltz said no date has been set yet for that summit. Ushakov told Russian television that a meeting was “unlikely” to take place next week, while Waltz said he thought it could be arranged in the coming weeks.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Lavrov mentioned the same three goals as Rubio and said that Washington and Moscow agreed to appoint representatives to carry out “regular consultations” on Ukraine.\n\n“I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position” the Russian foreign minister said.\n\nThe meeting marked the most extensive contact between the two countries since Moscow’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkentalked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20meeting in India nearly two years ago, but tensions remained high.\n\nThe recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Ukraine and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won’t be favorable to them.\n\nKyiv’s absence at Tuesday’s talksrankled many Ukrainians, and France called anemergency meetingof European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to discuss the war. Kyiv’s participation in such talks was a bedrock of U.S. policy under Biden.\n\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the talks were aimed at determining how serious the Russians are about achieving peace and whether detailed negotiations can start.\n\nRubio said Tuesday that there would be “engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe and others. But ultimately, the Russian side will be indispensable to this effort.”\n\nRubio also said ending the conflict would require concessions from all sides and that Washington “is not going to predetermine” what those concessions would be.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethsaid last weekthat NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia — twokey items on Putin’s wish list.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelenskyy following Monday’s European meeting.\n\n“We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,” Macron wrote on social media platform X. “To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” he said and vowed to “work on this together with all Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians.”\n\nThe meeting at the Diriyah Palace in the Saudi capital of Riyadh also highlighted de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to be a major diplomatic player, burnishing a reputation severely tarnished by the 2018killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSaudi state media described the talks as happening at the prince’s direction. Like the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the prince has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in 2023.\n\nBut Zelenskyy postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks since Ukrainian officials weren’t invited. His visit was rescheduled for March 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia continued to pummel Ukraine with drones, according to Kyiv’s military. The Ukrainian air force said Russian troops launched a barrage of 176 drones at Ukraine overnight, most of which were destroyed or disabled by jamming.\n\nOne Russian drone struck a residential building in Dolynska in the Kirovohrad region, wounding a mother and her two children and prompting an evacuation of 38 apartments, the regional administration reported.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

Only jointly can Russia and the US address lots of world problems, resolve global conflicts and offer solutions.\"\n\nZelenskyy said he would also be travelling to Saudi Arabia in a video briefing on Monday, although he stressed that his visit was not linked to Russia-US peace talks.\n\nKeith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, is also set to visit Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday.\n\nIn response to fast-moving negotiations that seemed to be taking place without Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron convened an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday with other European leaders.\n\nAfter the meeting, they vowed to continue supporting Ukraine butfailedto provide concrete security guarantees, including a potential idea to send peacekeeping troops to Ukrainian territory.",
