        "source_1": "The decision triggers fears that the U.S. might return to a pattern of military interference in the region that dates to the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nSimon Romero reported from Mexico City, and Annie Correal from New York.\n\nJust a decade ago, the era of U.S.wars,coup plotsandmilitary interventionsin Latin America seemed to be ebbing when the Obama administrationdeclaredthat the Monroe Doctrine, which longassertedU.S. military supremacy in the Americas, was dead.\n\nNow this cornerstone of foreign policy is roaring back to life, resurrecting fears over U.S. military interference in the region after President Trumporderedthe Pentagon to use military force against certain Latin American drug cartels.\n\nLeaders in the region are still trying todecipherwhat Mr. Trump’s order could mean. Mexico and Venezuela, two nations where the administration has designated cartels within their borders as terrorist groups, seem especially vulnerable.\n\nBut up and down much of Latin America, any whisper of reviving such actions could also unleash a chain reaction resulting in a surge in anti-American sentiment. The news of Mr. Trump’s order has already intensified a wariness against intervention from abroad, even in Ecuador and other countries plagued by violent drug wars in recent years.\n\n“I’m a right-wing conservative, so I want armed citizens and the military actually shooting,” said Patricio Endara, 46, a businessman in Quito. “But I wouldn’t agree with having foreign soldiers in Ecuador.”\n\nThat skepticism draws from the bitter memories left by the long record of U.S. military interventions in the region, whether through direct or indirect action, as during Colombia’s long internal war.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

        "source_2": "Mexico has said US military would not be entering its territory following reports that President Donald Trump had directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels.\n\n\"The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday. \"We co-operate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that Trump had secretly signed a directive to begin using military force on foreign soil.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the White House did not address the directive but said that Trump's \"top priority is protecting the homeland\".\n\nThe reported directive appears to follow an executive order signed by Trump earlier this year formally designating eight drug cartels as terrorist entities - six of which are Mexican.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Sheinbaum said the Mexican government was informed that an order on the cartels was coming, and \"that it had nothing to do with the participation of any military personnel\".\n\n\"It is not part of any agreement, far from it. When it has been brought up, we have always said 'No',\" she said.\n\nEarlier this year, Sheinbaum told reporters that Trump's decision to designate cartels as terrorists \"cannot be an opportunity for the US to invade our sovereignty\".\n\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the designation would help the US target cartels, including through intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense.\n\n\"We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organisations, not simply drug dealing organisations,\" Rubio said.\n\nThe New York Times report says the directive signed by Trump provides \"an official basis for the possibility of direct military operations\" against cartels, both at sea and on foreign soil.\n\nIn recent months, Mexico has worked with the US to curb the illegal flow of both migrants and drugs through the US-Mexico border.\n\nJune saw the lowest border crossings on record, according to data by the US Customs and Border Protections, and last week, US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said fentanyl seizures at the border were down by over half.\n\nIn a post on X, Johnson celebrated the collaboration between Sheinbum and Trump, writing that their leadership had resulted in cartels \"going bankrupt and our countries are safer because of it\".\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nHe has apologised over the Oaxaca Slip-on, inspired by sandals made by Indigenous artisans, after criticism from Mexico.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.\n\nTariffs, oversupply and teetotaling Gen-Zs have all contributed to the downfall of one of America's most iconic liquors.",

It does not involve our territory.\"\n\nTrump has previously discussed using military force against drug cartels in an effort to stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants across the southern border. He has also sanctioned high-ranking members of Cartel del Noreste, one of the most violent drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico and a U.S.-designatedforeign terrorist organization.\n\nMost recently, he has used the threat of tariffs to force Mexico and Canada to actively participate in anti-smuggling efforts.\n\nIn relation to Latin American cartels, the administration has also singled out Venezuelan PresidentNicolas Maduro, who is wanted by the U.S. On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a $50 million reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\n\"Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TdA (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa and Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de Soles) to bring deadly violence to our country,\" Bondi said in a video message. \"He is one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security.\"\n\nWeeks after taking office, the White House announced the extradition of 29 members of various Mexican drug cartels.\n\n\"The previous Administration allowed these criminals to run free andcommit crimesall over the world. The Trump Administration is declaring these thugs as terrorists, because that is what they are, and demanding justice for the American people,\" the White House said at the time.\n\nLouis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.
