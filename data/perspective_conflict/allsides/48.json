        "source_1": "As cease-fire talks stalled, a deadly strike on a Catholic church in Gaza City prompted Pope Leo XIV to call for an immediate end to the fighting.\n\nAn Israeli strike hit a Catholic church in Gaza City on Thursday, killing three people and injuring at least six others, including the parish priest, according to church officials.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians were sheltering at the Holy Family Catholic Church compound when the church roof was hit around 10:10 a.m., sending shrapnel and debris flying. Farid Jubran, a spokesman for the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, said it was unclear whether the munition that struck was dropped from an airplane or fired by a tank.\n\nPresident Trump called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to express “not a positive reaction” to the attack on the church, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a news briefing.\n\nShortly afterward, Mr. Netanyahu’s office issued a statement saying: “Israel deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit Gaza’s Holy Family Church. Every innocent life lost is a tragedy. We share the grief of the families and the faithful.”\n\nAfter the attack, Pope Leo XIV called for “an immediate cease-fire” in Gaza in astatement.\n\nThe Israeli military said that “an initial inquiry into reports regarding injured individuals in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, suggests that fragments from a shell fired during operational activity in the area hit the church mistakenly.” It said the cause of the incident was under review.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Nine other people were wounded, one of whom is in a critical condition in hospital. The parish priest was lightly injured.\n\nIsrael's prime minister said it \"deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit\" the church and the Israeli military said the incident was under review.\n\nMany displaced families from Gaza's small Christian community have been living in the church compound since the war began after their own homes were destroyed.\n\nWhile he was alive, the late Pope Francis called them on a near-daily basis.\n\nA video and photos shared with the BBC showed the roof of the Holy Family Church was hit, close to the cross, and that windows were broken.\n\nTV footage showed the Argentine parish priest, Father Gabriele Romanelli, walking unsteadily and checking on a man on a stretcher at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City.\n\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told the Vatican News website that the Holy Family Church was hit by a tank shell.\n\n\"What we know for sure is that a tank, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] says by mistake, but we are not sure about this. They hit the church directly,\" he said.\n\nThe charity Caritas Jerusalem said the shell hit the church roof, \"scattering shrapnel and debris across the yard\".\n\n\"At the time, some individuals were outside the main building, including two elderly women who were sitting inside our Caritas psychosocial support tent. Both were severely wounded and were transported by ambulance to Al-Ahli Hospital after a 15-minute delay,\" it said.\n\n\"Three young people who had been standing at the entrance of the church were also badly injured and were rushed to the hospital using private vehicles.\"\n\nLater, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced that \"three individuals lost their lives as a result of the injuries sustained and nine others were wounded, including one in critical condition and two in serious condition\".\n\nIt named those killed as Saad Issa Kostandi Salameh, the 60-year-old parish janitor, Foumia Issa Latif Ayyad, 84, and Najwa Abu Daoud.\n\nThe patriarchate said it \"strongly condemns this tragedy and this targeting of innocent civilians and of a sacred place\".\n\n\"However, this tragedy is not greater or more terrible than the many others that have befallen Gaza. Many other innocent civilians have also been harmed, displaced and killed,\" it added.\n\nThe Vatican's secretary of state sent a telegram to the victims saying Pope Leo was deeply saddened by the loss of life and had assured Father Romanelli \"and the whole parish community of his spiritual closeness\".\n\n\"His holiness renews his call for an immediate ceasefire, and he expresses his profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region,\" it added.\n\nIn the evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Israel deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit Gaza's Holy Family Church.\"\n\n\"Every innocent life lost is a tragedy. We share the grief of the families and the faithful.\"\n\nThe IDF said an initial inquiry suggested that \"fragments from a shell fired during operational activity in the area hit the church mistakenly\".\n\n\"The cause of the incident is under review,\" it added.\n\nAsked by reporters, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said US President Donald Trump had rung Netanyahu to discuss the issue.\n\n\"It was a mistake by the Israelis to hit that Catholic church, that's what the prime minister relayed to the president,\" she said.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said: \"The attacks against the civilian population that Israel has been carrying out for months are unacceptable.\"\n\n\"No military action can justify such an attitude,\" she added.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem also condemned the strike, which it called a \"flagrant violation of human dignity and a blatant violation of the sanctity of life and the sanctity of religious sites\".\n\nIt estimated that 600 displaced people were sheltering inside at the time, the majority of whom were children as well as 54 people with special needs.\n\nThe Holy Family Church falls within part of Gaza City that the Israeli military has previously told locals to leave.\n\nCaritas Jerusalem said Father Romanelli had urged people to remain in the rooms \"due to the presence of Israeli tanks near the church compound and continuous strikes in close proximity\".\n\n\"If Father Gabriel hadn't warned us to stay indoors, we could have lost 50 to 60 people today. It would have been a massacre,\" one Caritas staff member said.\n\nMore than 20 people are reported to have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza on Thursday.\n\nIn the north, medical sources said eight men protecting aid lorries and a couple and their five children were among those killed.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and led to 251 others being taken hostage.\n\nIsraeli attacks have since killed more than 58,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".\n\nProtesters call for the release of hostages still being held in Gaza as they voice support for Israel.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN, and Jonathan Miller, Deputy Permanent Representative for Israel to the UN, address a UN Security Council meeting.\n\nJohn Henry Newman will be the first British Doctor of the Church for more than 1,000 years.",

Gabriele Romanelli, the man who took the late pontiff’s phone calls every day to update him on the situation in Gaza, according to the Vatican.\n\nSince the war began following Hamas’terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, the church compound has taken in more than 600 Christians and Muslims living in Gaza, including dozens of children with disabilities, according to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Christian church said the building had suffered significant damage.\n\nTargeting the building “is a blatant affront to human dignity and a grave violation of the sanctity of life and the inviolability of religious sites, which are meant to serve as safe havens during times of war,” the Jerusalem-based church said in a statement.\n\nPope Leo XIV said he was “deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack″ and reaffirmed that the Vatican remains close to Romanelli and those taking refuge at the church.\n\nThe American pope once again called for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where Israel and Hamas forces have fought for 650 days, with the current peace talksbearing no fruit.\n\nThe Holy Family Catholic Church’s 60-year-old janitor and an 84-year-old woman were the latest casualties in the war, according to the Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the dead and injured.\n\nFadel Naem, the hospital’s acting director, said both the areas around the church and medical center have been struck repeatedly in the last week.\n\nWhile the Israeli military has defended bombing civilian infrastructure as a necessity to rout out Hamas, the Jewish state’s foreign minister issued a rare apology after the church was hit.\n\n“Israel expresses deep sorrow over the damage to the Holy Family Church in Gaza City and over any civilian casualty,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it was also aware of the damage and is currently investigating the strike.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slammed Israel for the deadly shelling, describing the attack on the church as emblematic of its bombardment campaign across Gaza that continues to claim civilian lives.\n\n“The attacks on the civilian population that Israel has been demonstrating for months are unacceptable. No military action can justify such an attitude,” she said."
