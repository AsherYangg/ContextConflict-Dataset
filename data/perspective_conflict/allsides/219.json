        "source_1": "President Trump's advisers are seriously considering the likelihood that he would be impeached again if Democrats take the House next year.\n\nWhy it matters:As the only twice-impeached president, Trump and his team are keenly aware of how much the process can weigh on the White House and grind a president's agenda to a halt.\n\nThe big picture:The threat of impeachment has added urgency to the Trump administration's push to get as much of his agenda through Congress as possible before the 2026 midterms — especially his plan to extend his 2017 tax cuts.\n\nZoom in:Democrats are under pressure from their base to oppose Trump more forcefully, and vowing to impeach Trump likely would help Democrats raise money from grassroots donors and elevate Democratic lawmakers' national profiles.\n\nZoom out:Impeachment was a back-burner issue for Trump's team even before the 2024 election. One senior Trump adviser said last year that the mere threat of a Democrat-led House with a Trump presidency was extra motivation to make sure the House would wind up in GOP hands.\n\nReality check:There are no standards for impeachment beyond what the House decides is an offense worthy of charges.\n\nAn impeachment is disruptive,but it ain't what it used to be to Trump, a second adviser to the president said.",

Shri Thanedar, D-Mich.,introducedseven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump alleging “a sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution and acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy”—though the impeachment articles, the first formal impeachment effort of Trump’s second term, are essentially certain to fail and come as the congressman faces growing competition in his next primary.\n\nThanedar announced the seven articles of impeachment Monday afternoon, saying in avideoposted to his X account that Trump has “done real damage to our democracy” and has “ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffires, D-N.Y., said Monday he hadn’t “evaluated the articles” or “even had an opportunity to talk with” Thanedar about them,Axiosreported.\n\nThanedar, in his second term from a Detroit-area district, introduced the impeachment articles after he drewa second challenger Monday—State Rep. Donavan McKinney—for the district’s next Democratic primary.\n\nThanedar said the most important of his seven impeachment articles was for “tyrannical overreach,” also noting the Trump administration’s refusal to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and give him due process “has to be the final straw.”\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts:We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.
