        "source_1": "The firm said it expects federal deficits to widen, mostly due to increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Building looms behind flags on the National Mall in Washington, Nov. 7, 2022. | J. David Ake/AP\n\nMoody’s Ratings Service on Friday said it is downgrading the U.S.’s creditworthiness in response to an increase in government debt over the past decade and rising interest payments, in a blow to the Trump administration that could push up borrowing costs.\n\nThe downgrade, which puts the U.S. one notch below the highest credit rating, was “driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation,” it said.\n\nMoody’s message: The fiscal outlook has not improved since the firm put the federal government on notice in November 2023 that it was at risk of losing its pristine reputation as a borrower.\n\nThe announcement comes as Republicans are debating President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that would extend 2017 tax cuts, with some hard-line conservatives fighting to limit the increase to federal spending deficits. But those deficits would increaseeven under conditionsoutlined by that group. The House Budget Committee voted against advancing the package Friday.\n\n“Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”\n\nThe announcement raises the risk that investors could demand that the U.S. pay higher yields on its debt.\n\nThe White House blamed former President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats for pursuing “spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans.”\n\n“The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden’s mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. “If Moody’s had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said Moody’s action “should be a wake-up call to Trump and Congressional Republicans to end their reckless pursuit of their deficit-busting tax giveaway.”\n\n“Sadly, I am not holding my breath — today’s GOP simply does not care about deficits or our nation’s fiscal health,” he said in a statement. “Republicans are hell-bent on a multi-trillion tax cut for the ultra-wealthy, leading to nothing but higher prices, more debt, and fewer jobs.”\n\nThe ratings service said it expects deficits to reach nearly 9 percent of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4 percent in 2024 — already an unusually large number. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would like to achieve a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 percent.\n\nMoody’s is the last of the three major credit rating firms to say the U.S. no longer qualifies for the highest level of creditworthiness. Fitch lowered its rating for U.S. government debt in 2023, while Standard & Poor’s did so more than a decade ago following an 11th-hour showdown over raising the debt ceiling.",
        "source_2": "The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt.\n\nIn lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.\n\nA triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts.\n\nMoody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917.\n\nThe downgrade \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" Moody's said in the statement.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said it was \"focused on fixing Biden's mess\", while taking a swipe at Moody's.\n\n\"If Moody's had any credibility,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"\n\nA lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs.\n\nMoody's maintained that the US \"retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency\".\n\nThe firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year.\n\nGDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment.\n\nThe downgrade came on the same day asTrump's landmark spending billsuffered a setback in Congress.\n\nTrump's so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it.\n\nFigures showed theUS economy shrank in the first three months of the yearas government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.\n\nThe economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
