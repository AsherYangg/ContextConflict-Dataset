        "source_1": "This is a “defeat for Russia,” said key European lawmaker after nail-biting referendum.\n\nMoldova voted in favor of joining the European Union by a narrow margin, in a referendum that came down to just a few thousand votes amid accusations of Russian interference.\n\nA razor-thin victory for pro-EU forces was virtually certain with 99.9 percent of votes counted as of late Monday morning. 50.4 percent of Moldovan voters backed changing the constitution to include EU membership, with 49.6 percent opposing the move.\n\nDuring along and nerve-wracking nightfor officials and activists in the Eastern European nation, the “no” campaign maintained a lead until near the end. Moldovans inside the country voted against the pro-EU campaign, but ballots cast by people living abroad swung the result at the climax.\n\nAt midnight, with more than 90 percent of votes counted and “yes” lagging by almost 10 points, pro-Western President Maia Sandu held an emergency press conference in which she blamed the early tally on “foreign forces” using cash and propaganda to influence the result.\n\nHowever, overwhelming support for membership from the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans living in European countries, the U.S. and Canada saw the gap narrow.\n\nSiegfried Mureșan, a Romanian MEP who chairs the parliament’s liaison committee working on Moldova’s accession to the EU, said the knife-edge passage of the constitutional referendum “represents a victory for the people of the Republic of Moldova and a defeat for Russia.”\n\n“I will ensure that we, as the European Union, respect the will of the Moldovan people expressed in the referendum and provide all the necessary support for the EU accession process,” he added.\n\nMoscow stands accused of launching amassive campaign of vote buying, funneling cash through its proxies into the accounts of ordinary voters, as well as using social media to sow fears about the prospect of EU membership leading to a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nThe result means the government can amend the constitution to enshrine the principle of EU membership, and opens the door to joining the bloc after ongoing talks on accession conclude. Officials are working towards a 2030 deadline to become a member country, and have called on Brussels to commit to the same date.\n\nIn a simultaneous presidential election, Sandu topped the list of candidates with around 42 percent of the vote. However, having failed to achieve an outright majority, she will now face pro-Russian candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo in a second-round runoff.\n\nMoscow is hoping pro-European Moldovans living abroad don’t go out to vote in September’s elections, the country’s national security chief told POLITICO.\n\nBackroom deals, embassy contacts and brown liquor built a booming export trade. Now, the lobbyist who saw it all says the U.S. president’s dalliances with Vladimir Putin are an incoming “asteroid” for the industry.\n\n“The low percentage of consistent support for democracy is truly worrying,” warns NGO chief.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced the move ahead of a call with the U.K. and Germany.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMoldova has voted \"yes\" to joining theEuropean Unionwith the tiniest of majorities—meaning the former Soviet republic has narrowly agreed to move politically closer to the West and away from Russia's influence.\n\nJust 50.39 percent of the eastern European country backed the idea of becoming part of theEUin the knife-edge referendum on Sunday—with the country's president, Maia Sandu, warning that the ballot had been hit by \"unprecedented\" outside interference. The tight finish sent shockwaves around the world because the referendum had been expected to pass comfortably, according to theBBC, since Moldovan polls all pointed to a clear majority in favor of joining the EU, but the result will still be a blow to the Russian president,Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe EU explicitly blamed Russia for trying to subvert Moldova's referendum, with EU spokesperson Peter Stano telling Reuters about \"intimidation and foreign interference by Russia and its proxies ahead of this vote.\" There were allegations that Moscow ran a propaganda campaign and bribed Moldovans to throw the vote for cash. For example, fugitive fraudster tycoon Ilan Shor, who lives in Russia, took to social media toopenly offer to pay Moldovans to vote \"no.\"\n\nMoldova is the second-poorest country in Europe after Ukraine under one metric (gross national income converted to dollars using purchasing power parity rates) that is used by the World Population Review website.\n\n\"Criminal groups... have attacked our country with tens of millions of euros, lies and propaganda, using the most disgraceful means to keep our citizens and our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability,\" Sandu said, following the vote.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied interfering in the referendum—demanding proof of the claims—and baselessly branded Moldova's referendum \"unfree\" because the voting patters in favour of the EU were \"hard to explain.\"\n\nNewsweekis attempting to reach out by email to the Kremlin and Moldova's government seeking comment.\n\nThe controversy follows allegations ofRussian interference in another EU referendum, when the U.K.narrowly voted to leave the bloc in a move dubbed \"Brexit\" in 2016. The U.S. has also accused Russia of spreading disinformationto influence next month's presidential electionafter trying torig previous American votes.\n\nMoldova, which has 2.6 million people and borders Romania and Ukraine, has been embroiled in something of a tug-of-war between the competing influences of Russia and the West. Historically, the country was firmly in Russia's orbit, but it is now hovering on the cusp of moving away from Moscow's sphere of influence permanently. Sandu has been pursuing a pro-EU path for the past four years.\n\nA presidential election was also held on Sunday, with the twin votes running simultaneously.\n\nSandu won with 42 percent of the vote, while her rival, Alexandr Stoianoglo, (who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists) achieved a share of 26 percent —a stronger result for him than polls had predicted, according to Reuters. There will now be a run-off election between the two politicians on November 3.\n\nMoldova has already begun the long process of formally joining the EU, but it was hoped that a resounding referendum vote for membership would shore-up the plans. Instead, the shaky win has left that position looking weaker than before, while Sandu now faces a further electoral battle to keep hold of the presidency next month.\n\nMichael D.

        "source_3": "Update (13:00 ET):Pushed over the top by absentee ballots submitted by expatriates,Moldova's referendum calling for membership in the European Union has passed by a razor-thin margin-- 50.46% Yes to 49.54% No.\n\nMoldova's government blamed the unexpectedly close finish on Russian interference. However, Moldova itself has been accused of manipulating the critical expatriate vote with an uneven facilitation of absentee voting.\"Moldovan authorities opened only two polling stations in Moscow for 400,000 Moldovan citizens living in Russia (instead of 17 in the past),\"tweetedMikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna.\n\nThe people of Moldova have spoken: our EU future will now be anchored in the constitution. We fought fairly in an unfair fight—and we won.But the fight isn’t over. We will keep pushing for peace, prosperity, and the freedom to build our own future.\n\nWith 98.42% of votes counted as this is written,Moldova's Sunday referendum on whether the country should join the European Union teeters at a near-tie, with50.08% voting Yes and 49.92% voting No-- a difference of just 2,285 votes out of 1.46 million cast. The exceedingly close count defies polling that raised expectations for a comfortable win for Yes, and has the incumbent president -- who herself is headed for a surprise runoff for her own job --accusing Russia of interfering in the election.\n\nWith a population of about 3 million, the republic of Moldova is wedged between Romania and Ukraine.Most citizens speak Romanian, but there's a significant Russian-speaking minority. Consistent with that combination of location and demographics, the country's sentiments and policies have swung back and forth between pro-Russian and pro-Western. Since 2020 -- which brought the election of current President Maia Sandu -- a decidedly pro-Western slant has prevailed.\n\n⚡️ Moldovan President Maia Sandu condemned a “unprecedented attack by criminal forces” during the presidential elections and referendum, alleging that Russia may have bought over 300,000 votes.pic.twitter.com/glASI9j2IV\n\nComplicating the geopolitical picture is the slender breakaway republic of Transnistria, which lies along the east bank of the Dniester River, wedged between Ukraine and Moldova. While not recognized by any other state, it enjoys the economic and political support of Russia, along with the presence of some1,500 Russian soldiers.\n\nSunday's razor-close EU referendum and lackluster showing by Sandu seemingly signalthe country's political pendulum is swinging again.Sandu only received 41% of the vote, while her principal opponent, former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, scored 27%. With opposition expected to consolidate in the Nov. 3 runoff,Sandu appears to be in serious jeopardy of losing the presidency.\n\nSandurespondedto the results with accusations of an “unprecedented assault on our country’s freedom and democracy,”blaming Russia for working to rally opposition to EU membership.  The also claimed there had been\"a fraud of unprecedented scale,” in the form of an alleged scheme to buy 300,000 No votes.\n\nAs the election approached,Sandu's government accused Israeli-born, fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor of meddling in the election. Convicted of fraud and theft over a scam that drained $1 billion from Moldovan banks, Shor was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in absentia. Moldova is now accusing the 37-year-old of funneling money from Russia into a vote-buying effort. When accused of his financial crimes, Shor first fled to andlived in Israelbefore moving to Russia.\n\nTheBBCsaid it had observed an apparent indication of just such a vote-buying effort:\n\nA BBC producer heard a woman who had just dropped her ballot in the transparent box ask an election monitor where she would get paid.Outside, we asked directly whether she had been offered cash to vote and she admitted it without qualms. She was angry that a man who had sent her to the polling station was no longer answering her calls. “He tricked me!” she said. She would not reply when asked who she had voted for.\n\nThis woman voted in Moldova’s election on Sunday, then asked a surprised election monitor where she gets paid. So I decided to ask what she’d been promised…The authorities believe Russia has been channeling-in money to buy votes: that Moscow has not ‘let go’ of#Moldovapic.twitter.com/7bsDO3grwz\n\nA Yes victory on the referendum wouldn't immediately put Moldova in the EU. Rather, it would amend the country's constitution to declare EU membership is a goal of the republic, which declared its independence in 1991 in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Sandu has set 2030 as a goal for accession to the EU.\n\nThe set of dynamics in play -- election results that defy expectations of an establishment victory, followed by accusations of Russian interference -- echoes what's been repeatedly been observed both in the United States and Western Europe in recent years. On top of that,Moldovan authorities alsocensoredonline content that they characterized as disinformation.\n\nThat's not the only similarity:The referendum count had No with a narrow lead down the stretch, only to see Yes pull ahead as absentee ballots were tallied-- many cast by pro-EU \"diaspora\" Moldovans who don't even live in the country.\n\nEverywhere the same.Moldova finally did the democracy trick at 97,66% counted. 🤪The longest counting stations always ends up in the desired results. This could be surprisingly int. observed in many elections since few years.#Moldova#MoldovaElectionspic.twitter.com/V6VoKwCyez"
