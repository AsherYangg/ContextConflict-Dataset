        "source_1": "TheSupreme Courtstayed a lower court's order requiring theTrump administrationto provide due process to deportees who they planned to remove to \"third-party countries.\"\n\nIn anunsigned ordershared on Monday, the court paused the lower court's requirements in deportation cases where migrants are being removed to countries other than their own. JusticeSonia Sotomayorcalled the ruling \"inexcusable\" and said that the court was \"rewarding lawlessness\" from Trump's Department of Justice in a dissent joined by JusticesElena KaganandKetanji Brown Jackson.\n\n“Apparently, the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the Government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,” Sotomayor wrote. “That use of discretion is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”\n\nIn a statement toNBC News, Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance called the order \"horrifying.\"\n\n\"It strips away critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death,” said Realmuto, whose group helped bring the initial case.\n\nUS District Judge Brian Murphy had found that the Trump administration's decision to deport migrants to countries like El Salvador and South Sudan without allowing them to argue against their removal \"unquestionably\" violated the Constitution. The Trump administration requested emergency relief from the order, saying it needed the authority to carry out deportations quickly.\n\n\"The United States is facing a crisis of illegal immigration, in no small part because many aliens most deserving of removal are often the hardest to remove,\" Solicitor General John Sauer told the high court in his appeal.\n\nSotomayor's dissent tore into her colleagues on the court for granting \"emergency relief from an order [the government has repeatedly defied.\"\n\nAlex Galbraith is Salon's nights and weekends editor, and author of our free daily newsletter,Crash Course.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTheSupreme Courthanded the Trump administration a critical victory in its deportation efforts on Monday in a 6-3 ruling in which it sided with theDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS)—for the moment—in allowing migrants to be sent to third countries to which they have no connection.\n\nPresidentDonald Trumphas prioritized immigration control as a key pillar of his second administration, having campaigned in 2024 on the promise of mass deportations and appointedTom Homanas his administration's border czar to execute his agenda.\n\nImmigration advocacy and human rights groups have launched legal challenges against elements of the administration's policies, including deportations to third countries and the cancellation of some immigrants' legal status.\n\nMonday's decision stays a lower court's injunction preventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from flying deportees to countries other than their home nation.\n\nThe court's three liberal justices dissented, with JusticeSonia Sotomayorwarning that \"in matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution. In this case, the Government took the opposite approach.\"\n\nThe case—D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security—began after attempts were made to send a select group of ICE detainees to a third country, something not usually allowed under federal law.\n\nSome nations do not cooperate with the U.S. regarding repatriations, meaning nationals from those countries are left in the U.S. under final orders of removal. The Trump administration has sought to change that by entering agreements with other countries to accept noncitizens.\n\nThe case before the Supreme Court involves plaintiffs sent to El Salvador, and those who were deported in late May, headed for South Sudan, despite the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issuing an order preventing such a move.\n\nThe district judge in that case intervened, and the group, with DHS agents, were forced to remain on a U.S. base in Djibouti.\n\nDHS has argued that other countries did not want the deportees involved in this case, and that the agreements with third countries are necessary to deliver on Trump's promises of mass deportations.\n\nWhile some immigrants involved did, and do, have final orders of removal, one of the key arguments at hand is whether they are given enough notice on their potential final destination, allowing them the chance to appeal.\n\nSotomayor, in her dissent:\"Rather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires, this Court now intervenes to grant the Government emergency relief from an order it has repeatedly defied. I cannot join so gross an abuse of the Court's equitable discretion.\"\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a post on X:\"MAJOR win for the safety and security of the American people.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does allow for the legal challenge to third-country removals to continue, but DHS will be free to carry out these removal flights in the meantime.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.
