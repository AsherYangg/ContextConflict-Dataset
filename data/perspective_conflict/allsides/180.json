        "source_1": "DHS claims payment will be issued after individuals leave the US and it has been confirmed through their app\n\nTheTrump administrationhas announced a new program offering a $1,000 payment to people in the US without immigration status as an incentive to return to their home country voluntarily.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined the initiative on Monday, pledging “financial and travel assistance” to undocumented immigrants who agree to leave the country usingan app called CBP Home.\n\nThat is a version of the app devised in the Biden administration called CBPOne that gave people approaching theUS-Mexico borderwithout official arrangements astrictly limitedchannel to request asylum in the US and enter legally when issued an appointment. Donald Trumpshut that downupon inauguration,as vowed, strandingmany, and later changed its name and function so that CBP Home is a tool to exit the US, not enter.\n\nThe agency claimed that the $1,000 payment would be issued only after the individual has returned to their home country and it has been confirmed through the app. DHS made the announcement in anews releaseemphasizing many of the terms, some legally questionable, favored by the administration in its hardline anti-immigration policy, such as “illegal alien” and “self-deport”.\n\n“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,”saidKristi Noem, the DHS secretary.\n\nIn the news release, DHS stated that one individual had already participated in the program, receiving a plane ticket for a flight from Chicago to Honduras, and “additional tickets have already been booked for this week and the following week”.\n\nThe department estimates that even with the cost of the stipend, the program “will decrease the costs of a deportation by around 70%”.\n\nCurrently, the DHS claims, the average cost to arrest, detain and deport someone from the US is $17,121.\n\nThe agency also stated in the announcement that individuals who use the CBP Home app to declare their intent to leave the US will be “deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure”.\n\nThe DHS further claimed that participation in the program “may help preserve the option” for an individual to re-enter the US “legally in the future”.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Trump pushed similar claims, telling reporters from the Oval Office: “We’re going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little work, they can come back in if they’re good people.”\n\n“It is an incredibly cruel bit of deception for DHS to be telling people that if they leave they ‘will maintain the ability to return to the US legally in the future’,”saidAaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, in a social media post. “Many people who might see this as an option would be put in a WORSE OFF legal position. So this is a TRAP.”\n\nThe new initiative, centered on the Trump administration’s concept of “self-deportation” – which is the notion that conditions in the UScan be made so unbearablefor undocumented immigrants that they will choose to leave – is their latest action to crack down on immigration.",

        "source_3": "The Trump administration has started paying illegal migrants to $1,000 each to “self-deport” from the US, and the Department of Homeland Security said it will save taxpayers up to $1 million per family.\n\nImmigrants can avoid arrest by federal immigration agents if they choose to use the Trump administration’s CBP Home app. The DHS will pay for commercial flights out of the US, and then send cash once they confirm they’ve left.\n\nDespite shelling out the cash, DHS projects that taxpayers will save 70% over the cost of rounding up and deporting each illegal migrant.\n\nIt costs taxpayers an average of $17,121 for the feds to arrest, detain and deport a single illegal immigrant, according to DHS.\n\nStephen Miller, President Trump’s top policy and homeland security adviser, said on X Monday that the “savings are as much as $1 million per illegal alien family given the long-term costs of free welfare and public support.”\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said that “self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way” for illegal immigrants to avoid arrest by ICE.\n\n“Download the CBP Home App TODAY and self-deport,” said Noem.\n\nThe first illegal immigrant who cashed in through the program was “allowed” into the US by the Biden administration before choosing to return to Honduras from Chicago, according to DHS.\n\nIn Trump’s first 100 days back in the White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers already deported nearly 66,000 illegal immigrants,the agency saidlast week.\n\n“We’re just 100 days into this administration and thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is using every tool at its disposal to enforce our country’s immigration laws and protect our communities,” acting ICE director Todd Lyons said."
