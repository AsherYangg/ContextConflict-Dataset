        "source_1": "Following four days of escalating protests that defaced landmarks and damaged property in downtown L.A., Mayor Karen Bass imposed a regional curfew on Tuesday in an effort to restore order.\n\nThe curfew is in place from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. across most of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe curfew footprint is from the 5 Freeway to the 110 Freeway and from the 10 Freeway to where the 110 and 5 freeways merge. The remainder of the city is not subject to the curfew.\n\nThere are limited exceptions to the curfew for those living and working in downtown L.A., credentialed members of the media, law enforcement and emergency personnel.\n\nBass said that she expects the curfew to remain in place for several days and will consult with law enforcement and elected leaders before lifting it. She said it was necessary to curb the actions of “bad actors who do not support the immigrant community.”\n\nMayor Bass and L.A. Police Chief Jim McDonnell have both said that the curfew will be strictly enforce and those in violation will be arrested.\n\n“I am exercising my mayoral powers to implement a curfew within downtown Los Angeles,” said Bass. “If you do not live or work in downtown L.A., avoid the area. Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted.”\n\nLos Angeles police arrested at least 25 people Tuesday night amid a curfew downtown as faith leaders made calls for “nonviolent resistance.”\n\nThe majority of protesters cleared the downtown area after curfew began Tuesday night. A small crowd, however, remained, and the Los Angeles Police Department arrested 17 people on suspicion of violating curfew, according to a Wednesday morning news release. A spokesperson for the department had given The Times an arrest total of 25 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe curfew comes as arrests have continuously increased since protests began on Friday in response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Southern California.\n\nAlthough no demonstrators were arrested by local law enforcement Friday, tensions escalated over the course of the weekend, leading to larger gatherings punctuated by episodes of violence, theft, graffiti and property destruction.\n\nL.A. police made 27 arrests on Saturday, 40 on Sunday and more than 100 on Monday, police said. A further 205 protesters were arrested Tuesday before Bass declared the curfew at 5:30 p.m.\n\nSurprise U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in downtown Los Angeles prompt fierce pushback from protesters and officials.\n\nPeople were arrested for an array of alleged crimes including failure to disperse, throwing a Molotov cocktail at an officer, driving a motorcycle into a line of officers, destruction of property and looting.\n\n“Many businesses have now been affected by vandalism,” said Bass on Tuesday. “Last night there were 23 businesses that were looted. If you drive through downtown, the graffiti is everywhere and has caused significant damages to businesses and a number of properties.”\n\nA citywide curfew from 8 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. was implemented by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti during protests in May and June 2020 followingGeorge Floyd’s murder. Then-L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva followed suit, announcing a countywide curfew beginning at 6 p.m. and ending at 6 a.m.\n\nThe curfews came after several days of largely peaceful demonstrations that were  broken up by burglaries, fires and clashes with police. The move marked the first time since the 1992 Rodney King uprising that such a sweeping curfew had been enacted in Los Angeles.",
        "source_2": "A curfew is in place for a second night in Los Angeles after nearly a week of unrest in the city over US immigration raids.\n\nMultiple people were arrested for violating the downtown curfew shortly after it came into effect at 20:00 local time on Wednesday (03:00 GMT on Thursday), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.\n\nNearly 400 people have been arrested in LA since protests began on Friday, including 330 undocumented migrants and 157 people arrested for assault and obstruction - including one for the attempted murder of a police officer.\n\nFederal prosecutors have so far charged two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers in two separate incidents.\n\nA total of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest. Some of those National Guard troops are now authorised to detain people until police can arrest them.\n\nHundreds of protesters marched to Los Angeles City Hall early in the evening before being dispersed by police.\n\nAs the curfew came into effect for a second night, LA Mayor Karen Bass wrote on X that the measure was designed to \"stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the president's chaotic escalation\".\n\nShe had earlier blamed the demonstrations on US President Donald Trump's immigration raids, which she said \"provoked\" residents by causing \"fear\" and \"panic\".\n\n\"A week ago, everything was peaceful,\" she told a news conference. \"Things began to be difficult on Friday when raids took place.\"\n\nBass suggested Los Angeles was \"part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in taking over power from a local government, from a local jurisdiction\". She has called on the administration to end the raids.\n\nBass's curfew, ordered on Tuesday, affects a relatively small area of about one square mile in the second-largest city in the US. She said she wanted \"to stop the vandalism, to stop the looting\", as LA had reached a \"tipping point\".\n\nLater on Tuesday evening, police said they made \"mass arrests\" after another day of protest over the immigration action.\n\nIn a series of statements, they said that those detained included 203 people arrested for failure to disperse, 17 for curfew violations, three for possession of a firearm, and one for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer.\n\nTwo officers were injured in the skirmishes, the statement added.\n\nBut, the following day, police chief Jim McDonnell stressed that the disorder had occurred in a limited area: \"Some of the imagery of the protests and the violence gives the appearance as though this is a city-wide crisis, and it is not.\"\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters at the White House that the curfew had \"helped a bit\".\n\nElsewhere in LA, Trump's immigration raids have continued, with the assistance of the National Guard troops.\n\nThe National Guard and Marine forces deployed to Los Angeles do not have the authority to make arrests - only to detain protesters until police can arrest them.\n\n\"They are strictly used for the protection of the federal personnel as they conduct their operations and to protect them to allow them to do their federal mission,\" said Maj Gen Scott Sherman, who is leading the deployment.\n\nSome 500 National Guard troops have already been trained to accompany agents on immigration raids and some troops have already temporarily detained people in LA protests, Sherman told US media outlets.\n\nTrump's row with state officials has ramped up after his decision to deploy federal troops to LA. The president has vowed to \"liberate\" the city, but he has been accused by California Governor Gavin Newsom of an \"assault\" on democracy.\n\nOther state officials, too, have insisted that local law enforcement has the situation under control.\n\nBut US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has backed Trump, telling a Senate hearing on Wednesday that sending the troops to Los Angeles was \"lawful and constitutional\".\n\nThe military deployment to the LA area will cost $134m (£99m), the Pentagon has said.\n\nWhile addressing troops at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina earlier this week, Trump described the protests as a \"full-blown assault on peace and public order\".\n\nThe Republican president said he planned to use \"every asset at our disposal to quell the violence\".\n\nHe urged troops to boo the names of Newsom and Joe Biden, his presidential predecessor, during his speech.\n\nIn televised remarks of his own, Newsom - who is seen as a potential presidential contender himself - again criticised the president's rare deployment of the US military without a request from state officials. He called it a \"brazen abuse of power\".\n\n\"California may be first – but it clearly won't end here,\" he said. \"Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault right before our eyes.\"\n\nTrump has set a goal for border agents of at least 3,000 daily arrests as he seeks to ramp up mass deportations, a signature pledge of his re-election campaign.\n\nSince assuming office, the president has drastically reduced illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border to historically low levels.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June, before the protests kicked off, found 54% of Americans saying they approved of Trump's deportation policy, and 50% approved of how he was handling immigration.\n\nThat compares with smaller numbers of 42% who gave approval to his economic policy and 39% for his policy on tackling inflation.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.",
        "source_3": "Dozens of people were arrested in downtown Los Angeles overnight Tuesday into Wednesday as Marines and the California National Guard joined local police in enforcing a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 am.\n\nMayor Karen Bass joined other Democrats, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, in blaming Trump for the violence, in what she called a “chaotic escalation” (though riots began well before Trump responded).\n\nHowever, she imposed a curfew, and the state brought several different law enforcement agencies to L.A.\n\nTheLos Angeles Timesreportedthat 25 people had been arrested as of 9:00 p.m. Tuesday for violating the curfew, and that many other people had been stranded downtown, unable to leave for fear of arrest.\n\nLocal news outlet KTLAreportedWednesday: “L.A. may have just experienced its quietest day this week.”\n\nNewsom delivered a prime time address Tuesday evening, which had audio problems, in which he claimed Trump was using the situation to establish authoritarian powers and to destroy democracy.\n\nHowever, opinion polls show that Americans overwhelmingly back Trump. One poll Tuesdayshowedthat 59% supported Trump’s decision to federalize the California National Guard, against 39% who opposed it.\n\nJoel B.
