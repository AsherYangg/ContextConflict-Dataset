        "source_1": "Israeli forces attack Palestinians trying to get water in central Gaza, killing children, as they continue to target residential areas.\n\nAt least 10 Palestinians have been killed at a water collection point in central Gaza, six of them children, as famine spreads in the besieged enclave and food and water supplies remain at critically low levels.\n\nIsraeli forces on Sundaykilledat least 92 Palestinians, 52 of them in Gaza City, as they targeted residential areas and displacement camps across Gaza, medical and local sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe attack on the water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp, which also wounded 16 people, came as the Israeli military steps up attacks as itprepares to forcethe entire population of Gaza into a concentration zone in the south.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said there is a water crisis across the Gaza Strip.\n\n“Even though water is not suitable for drinking as most of the time it’s contaminated, thirst is pushing people to these areas,” he said, referring to Nuseirat.\n\n“This is not the first time it’s happening. This is close to 10 times and just in the past few months when people were directly and deliberately targeted as they were trying to get water.”\n\nIsrael’s relentless bombardment of Gaza killed at least 110 Palestinians on Saturday, including 34 peoplewaiting for foodat the Israeli- and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution site in Rafah.\n\nMahmoud said nearly 800 Palestinians have been killed since the GHF began distributing food parcels in Gaza at the end of May through its “monopoly of humanitarian aid distribution”, pushing aside other efficient, more organised and trusted organisations, including the United Nations.\n\n“A person can pick up a food parcel for their family, but that is not nearly enough to feed hungry children and hungry family members, and that’s the tragedy,” he said.\n\n“People are forced to make these dangerous trips from northern Gaza, from Gaza City, all the way to Rafah city. They walk for 12 to 15km [7.5 to 9 miles], and it takes them a whole day. Some do that at night, sleeping inside bombed-out buildings, to get there as early as possible. Despite all of these efforts to get there as early as possible, they are met with live ammunition and deliberate shooting by Israeli forces.”\n\nAt least 67 children have died of hunger in Gaza since October 2023, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Saturday.\n\nFurthermore, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, warned of a sharp rise in malnutrition cases as Israel’s blockade of the coastal enclave entered its 103rd day.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said one of its clinics in Gaza has seen an increase in the number of malnutrition cases since March when the Israeli siege started. “UNRWA hasn’t been allowed to bring in any humanitarian aid since,” it said.\n\nThe warnings came as Israeli forces continued to target starving Palestinians.\n\nOn Sunday, an Israeli warplane struck a house in the al-Sawarkah area west of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 10 people.\n\nIn the northern Gaza Strip, six Palestinians were killed and others injured when an Israeli warplane bombed a house in the Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City.\n\nFive others were killed and several more injured in a separate air strike that hit a house on Hamid Street in western Gaza City.\n\nIn the al-Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, a girl and another person were killed and several injured when Israeli forces bombed a home there.\n\nIn southern Gaza, Nasser Medical Complex medics confirmed the deaths of three people after an Israeli strike on a displacement tent in the al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis city.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli forces blew up several residential buildings in the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City.\n\nThe strikes came amid an apparent deadlock in a week of indirect talks in Qatar between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas for a ceasefire to halt the 21-month war.\n\nRejecting international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli army has pursued a genocidal offensive on Gaza since October 7, 2023, killing more than 58,000 Palestinians so far, most of them women and children.\n\nAlmost the entire population of more than 2 million people in Gaza have been forcibly displaced at least once during the war, which has created dire humanitarian conditions in the Palestinian territory.\n\nIn November, the International Criminal Court issuedarrest warrantsfor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\nIsrael also faces agenocide casebrought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.",
        "source_2": "Israel’s military said Sunday that a strike near a Gaza water distribution point that reportedly killed several children was an accident, as Israeli aircraft pounded targets across the Strip.\n\nThe strike, which the Israel Defense Forces attributed to a “technical malfunction,” came as negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal continued to stall, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly set to convene top ministers and defense brass in a bid to find a way to break the logjam.\n\nGazan health officials at Al-Awda Hospital saidthe strikethat hit a water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp killed 10 people, including six children.\n\nThe IDF admitted it had erred while targeting an operative from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group.\n\n“Due to a technical malfunction in the munition, it struck dozens of meters away from the intended target,” the IDF said, adding that it had opened an investigation and that it “makes every effort to minimize harm to uninvolved civilians.”\n\nRamadan Nassar, a witness who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that around 20 children and 14 adults had been lined up to get water. He said Palestinians walk some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to fetch water from the area.\n\nWater shortages in Gaza have worsened sharply in recent weeks, with fuel shortages causing desalination and sanitation facilities to close, making people dependent on collection centers where they can fill up their plastic containers.\n\nMore than a dozen people were also reported killed near an aid distribution site on Sunday, with eyewitnesses describing shots to victims’ heads and bodies. The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots, but that its review of the incident had found no evidence of anyone hurt by its soldiers’ fire.\n\nNegotiations toward a ceasefire in Gaza have stalled primarily over when the war will end and to what extent the IDF will withdraw during the truce.\n\nPalestine Al-Youm, an Islamic Jihad-affiliated news outlet, quoted a senior Hamas official Sunday saying negotiations had reached a critical stage and signaling the Palestinian group could walk away if the logjam was not cleared in the coming hours.\n\nChannel 12 news reported Sunday that Netanyahu would convene a meeting of senior defense officials and several government ministers that night in a bid to break the impasse, focusing on a new proposal for the troops’ redeployment in Gaza and the direction of talks.\n\nIDF brass has told the government that it is close to achieving the goals of its recent offensive, and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged an end to the 21-month-old war. Polls show most Israelis support a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas and end the war.\n\nDuring his recent visit to Washington, DC, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about a deal. But in a video posted to social media Sunday afternoon, he blamed Hamas for obstructing an agreement, saying Israel had accepted the outline proposed by Trump’s chief envoy, Steve Witkoff.\n\n“We accepted it, Hamas refused it,” Netanyahu said, adding that he “won’t accept” a deal that allows Hamas to stay in Gaza and rearm.”\n\nOn Saturday, Netanyahu pushed back on a New York Times report suggesting that he has prolonged the Gaza war and rejected viable hostage release deals for his own political survival.\n\nHe said in a statement that the article “defames Israel, its brave people, and soldiers, and its prime minister.” The Times responded that Netanyahu’s statement “does not refute the facts.”\n\nThe deal currently being negotiated in the Qatari capital would see 10 living hostages released in an initial 60-day stage, along with the remains of 18 deceased captives. Relatives of some of those held in Gaza have campaigned for a deal that ends the war and releases all hostages.\n\nHaggai Angrest, father of hostage Matan Angrest, who is thought to be alive, met with Netanyahu during his recent visit to Washington, DC. He told the Israeli news outlet Ynet that Netanyahu said that, for the first time, there were discussions about ending the war.\n\nAnd Idit Ohel, mother of hostage Alon Ohel, sent a written appeal to Netanyahu’s cabinet on Sunday saying she was “beleaguered, exhausted, and shaken,” in light of a medical opinion saying Ohel, who was injured in his eye upon being captured, could soon lose his vision.\n\nNetanyahu has insisted the war cannot end until Hamas is no longer able to rule Gaza or pose a threat to Israel, vowing to achieve both that goal and the return of all 50 hostages still being held in the Strip.\n\nThe IDF is waiting for the government to make a decision regarding the war as the military nears completion of its Gideon’s Chariots offensive, launched in mid-May. In late June, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said the military would soon “reach the lines” set by the offensive, in which the IDF aimed to take control of 75 percent of Gaza.\n\nThe army said Sunday that the Israeli Air Force had hit 150 targets across the enclave in the previous day, targeting Hamas operatives, booby-trapped buildings, weapon depots, anti-tank launch posts and other terror infrastructure.\n\nAt least 139 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between Saturday and Sunday afternoon, according to statistics published by the Hamas-run health ministry, raising the death toll to over 58,000.\n\nThe tolls, which cannot be verified, do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel during the October 7, 2023 onslaught.\n\nJordan announced Sunday morning that a local charity had sent 50 trucks of aid to Gaza. The shipment came after the European Union announced last week that a deal had been reached to reopen several aid corridors, including humanitarian routes through Egypt and Jordan.\n\nA group of United Nations agencies warned, meanwhile, that a fuel shortage had reached “critical levels” in Gaza, threatening aid operations, hospital care and already chronic food insecurity.\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas broke out on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 251. The 50 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity include the bodies of 28 confirmed dead by the IDF, one of whom has been held for over a decade.\n\nIsrael’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 451. The toll includes two police officers and three Defense Ministry civilian contractors.\n\nOn Sunday, in a rare incident, an Israeli soldier driving on a road in Israeli territory near Gaza was lightly wounded by a stray Israeli bullet.\n\nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.
