        "source_1": "At least five people – including a child – were killed and more than 200 injured after a car plowed into a crowd at aChristmas marketin the German city of Magdeburg on Friday, local authorities said.\n\n“It is unimaginable that this is happening in Germany,” Reiner Haseloff, the prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt state, of which Magdenburg is the capital, said during a visit to the scene with other officials on Saturday, confirming the latest toll.\n\nGerman authorities say thesuspect– who was arrested –  is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who has lived in Germany since 2006 and worked as a doctor in a nearby town. In a statement shared by Reuters news agency, US-based activist group RAIR Foundation USA named the suspect as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen.\n\nGerman media named the suspect as Taleb A. following the convention in Germany of withholding the full name of suspects in criminal cases. When asked by a journalist if “Taleb” is the correct name during a press conference on Saturday, senior public prosecutor Horst Nopens confirmed that it was.\n\nThe suspect is thought to have acted alone, according to German authorities.\n\nAuthorities have not released any information about a possible motive behind the attack but a since deleted X feed linked to the suspect showed he had in the past shared anti-Islam statements and accused Germany of promoting the Islamization of the country.\n\nThe German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Saturday described the alleged suspect as “an Islamophobe.” She gave few details and said that the investigation was just starting.\n\nA nine-year-old child and four adults were killed in the attack, the city’s deputy mayor Ronni Krug said. Local public broadcaster MDR previously reported the child victim was a toddler, citing Haseloff.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was among the group of politicians that laid flowers at a church near the market on Saturday, said he was “very worried” for the nearly 40 people who were critically injured in the attack.\n\n“There is no more peaceful, more joyous place in Germany than Christmas markets when people come together ahead of the Christmas festival and spend some time together, drink mulled wine, have a sausage together to relax together,” Scholz told reporters in Magdeburg.\n\nHe stressed that Germany must remain united after the fatal attack, and vowed that the perpetrator would not go unpunished, adding that investigators would, “try to understand what the motive was of the attacker in order to respond with the full strength of the law.”\n\nThe suspect had permanent residency in the country, according to Tamara Zieschang, the interior minister of Saxony-Anhalt state, and worked as a doctor in Bernburg, a small town about 25 miles south of Magdeburg.\n\nHe had rented the car used in the alleged attack, MDR reported, citing Haseloff.\n\nFootage from social media, verified by CNN, shows the gruesome moment a black car drove directly into the crowd at the busy Christmas market.\n\nIn the video, dozens of people can be seen crowded at the market stalls when the vehicle plows directly into them. Some people can be seen running away in panic, while others dive into the stalls. Bodies and debris are scattered across the narrow lane as the car turns out of the plaza.\n\nThe area around the car was previously cordoned off over suspicion that an explosive device could be inside it, but police later found no such device, local public broadcaster MDR reported, citing Magdeburg police.\n\nFootage geolocated from social media showed law enforcement officials arresting an individual about 500 feet (150 meters) from where the vehicle plowed into the crowd.\n\nThe video published by the AP news agency pans across a busy road to show a police officer aiming a handgun at the arrestee near a vehicle, which appears to be heavily damaged. Moments later two police vans arrive, and officers swarm the scene.\n\nA separate video also from AP, captured from across the street, shows officers handcuffing an individual lying prone beside the black SUV seconds later.\n\nCNN affiliate NTV reported on the same video, saying it captured the moment the suspect was arrested. CNN has not been able to confirm if this is the suspect in Friday’s market attack.\n\nThe number of injured people exceeded what hospitals in Magdeburg could handle, with some being flown to a hospital in the nearby city of Halle for treatment, MDR reported. Those with minor injuries were treated at a nearby shopping center and on a tram converted into a care center.\n\nAbout 100 firefighters and 50 rescue personnel have been deployed, the city of Magdeburg said.\n\nMagdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt, has a population of about 240,000.\n\nThe Christmas market was scheduled to be open from November 22 through December 29, according to its website. It has about 140 market stalls, as well as an ice skating rink, a ferris wheel and a children’s play area.\n\nHaseloff said mourning would take place in Germany, especially in the state. “We will fly the flags at half-mast to express what a tragedy has taken place here and that we all share in the suffering that has been inflicted on people,” he said.\n\nCity authorities announced there would be a memorial service at Magdeburg Cathedral at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) Saturday. Crowds have already gathered outside the church, as dozens of people lay down bouquets and candles to honor the victims.\n\nThe deadly attack has raised questions over how al-Abdulmohsen was able to gain access to the event via car and ram his vehicle into the festive crowds.\n\nThe deadly car-ramming has brought back memories of a terror attack in 2016, when a tractor trailer barreled into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring dozens. Security measures at markets across Germany were significantly tightened in its wake.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Madgeburg on Saturday, Scholz urged Germans to support one another and remember Germany “is one society” that will win through a “shared future.”\n\n“For me it’s important that when such a terrible, awful event happens, a terrible attack in which so many people were injured and killed, almost on the anniversary of the Breitscheidplatz terror attack in Berlin, that we as a country stay together and stick together,” he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack after it emerged that the suspect was a Saudi national.\n\n“The Kingdom affirms its position in rejecting violence and expresses its sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and to the Federal Republic of Germany, government and people, with its wishes for a speedy recovery for the injured,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe White House was closely monitoring the situation and US officials were in touch with their German counterparts that were investigating the situation to offer support, a National Security Council official told CNN.\n\nUS President Joe Biden shared his condolences in a statement on Saturday: “No community –and no family – should have to endure such a despicable and dark event, especially just days before a holiday of joy and peace.”\n\nEuropean leaders, including President of the European Council António Costa, French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof also sent their condolences.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that an additional victim died later from their injuries after a Christmas market attack in Berlin in 2016, bringing the toll to 13.\n\nCNN’s Avery Schmitz, Billy Stockwell, Inke Kappeler and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",

Haseloff stated that the suspected perpetrator is a doctor from Saudi Arabia working in Saxony-Anhalt, whose capital is Magdeburg.\n\nAuthorities suspect it was a deliberate act by the driver. He was not previously known to authorities as an Islamic extremist, said dpa, citing unidentified security officials.\n\nSocial media videos from the scene show the immediate aftermath of the incident with multiple wounded at the scene.\n\nGerman Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: “My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.”\n\nLess than a month ago, on November 28, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called for \"great vigilance\" at Germany's popular Christmas markets.\n\nShe stressed that there was no \"concrete\" evidence of a threat, but rather what she called a high threat situation more broadly.\n\n\"Federal security authorities do not currently have any concrete indications of danger,\" she told the newspapers of the RND media group.\n\n\"But in view of the high threat situation at an abstract level we still have reason to be very vigilant and to take effective action for our security.\"\n\nNancy Faeser stated that security authorities were monitoring \"all conceivable threats\" and pointed at the heightened security measures, including the enforcement of a strict knife ban at Christmas markets.\n\n8 years ago, on December 19, 2016, a Christmas market in Berlin was attacked when a man who pledged his allegiance to Islamic State (IS) drove a stolen truck through the crowd of visitors, killing 13 people and  injuring dozens.\n\nSecurity measures have been reinforced since the attack in the German capital. Such areas in Berlin are now protected by concrete barriers and strict security precautions have been put in place for the festive period. The question remain whether the same security measures have been introduced in smaller cities across the country.\n\nJust two weeka go, German authorities reported that they have foiled a potential terror attack on a Christmas market in Bavaria after a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency.  The 37-year-old suspect from Iraq was arrested in shared accommodation for asylum-seekers in Augsburg, German newspaper Welt reported, citing the sources who allegedly said the suspect had disseminated posts on social media glorifying and photographed the Christmas market in Augsburg. He allegedly talked about wanting to drive a car through the market, according to the Welt report.\n\nThe deadly incident in Magdeburg is sending shockwaves through Germany amid an ongoing political crisis as the country is gearing up for elections early next year.\n\nMagdeburg is located to the southeast of the capital Berlin in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, and has a population of around 240,000 people.",
