        "source_1": "Justin Trudeau announced his intention to resign on Jan. 6.\n\nCanada selected a new prime minister-elect on Sunday night, as Justin Trudeau's reignnears a closeamid a trade war with the United States.\n\nCanada's Liberal Party announced that Mark Carney was chosen to succeed Trudeau after party members voted in a nominating contest between four candidates.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Carney addressed U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada and the threat Trump has posed towards the country, calling the current events the \"greatest crisis of our lifetimes.\"\n\n\"We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves, so the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win,\" Carney said.\n\nIndirectly addressing Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state of the U.S., Carney added, \"America is not Canada, and Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nCarney also criticized Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods and said he supports the retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on the U.S.\n\n\"Donald Trump has put, as we know, unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living, he's attacking Canadian workers, businesses and families... we cannot let him succeed and we won't,\" Carney said. \"My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect.\"\n\nCarney is expected to be sworn in sometime this week by the governor general of Canada, a representative in Canada of Britain's King Charles III.\n\nThe newly elected Liberal Party leader is expected to immediately call for an election as early as late April.\n\nTrudeau, who was first elected prime minister in November 2015, announced on Jan. 6 his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and prime minister once a new party leader is determined through what he said would be \"a robust, nationwide, competitive process.\"\n\nThe candidates for prime minister included Chrystia Freedman, Canada's longtime deputy prime minister who, until December, served as Trudeau's finance minister; Frank Baylis, a businessman and former member of the House of Commons; Karina Gould, a member of Parliment, who served in Trudeau's Cabinet as minister of International Development and minister of Democratic Institutions; and Mark Carney, an economist who served as governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.\n\nHeading into the vote, Carney, who has never held an elected office, had emerged as a front-runner.\n\nCarney, who as governor of the Bank of Canada, is credited with helping to guide the country through the worst of the 2008 financial crisis as governor of the Bank of Canada. Carney has compared the comments of President Donald Trump, who has also threatened to make Canada the 51st U.S. state, to a villain in the Harry Potter series.\n\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" the 59-year-old Carney told supporters at an event in Winnipeg last month.\n\nTrudeau initially said he would serve as prime minister until March 24. He will then be replaced by the new Liberal Party leader.\n\nThe Canadian Parliament was supposed to begin its new session of 2025 on Jan. 27, but Trudeau had asked the governor general to extend and not start a new session of Parliament until March 24.\n\n\"I'm a fighter. Every bone in my body has always told me to fight because I care deeply about Canadians. I care deeply about this country, and I will always be motivated by what is in the best interest of Canadians,\" Trudeau said when he announced his plans in early January to resign.\n\nAt the time, Trudeau said he believed his resignation would \"bring the temperature down\" and allow Parliament to reset and get back to work \"for Canadians.\"\n\n\"Parliament needs a reset, I think, needs to calm down a bit and needs to get to work for Canadians,\" Trudeau said when answering reporters' questions following his announcement. \"Removing me as the leader who will fight the next election for the party should decrease the polarization that we have right now.\"\n\nSupport for Trudeau's party has declined steadily for months, with the Liberals falling in early January to their lowest level of support in years, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nIn recent days, Trudeau has emerged as the face of Canada in a trade war that erupted with the United States over 25% tariffs that Trump imposed on products from Canada.\n\nCanada countered by imposing a 25% tariff ongoodsfrom the United States, including American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles, and certain pulp and paper products.\n\nCanadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said a second wave of retaliatory tariffs would be suspended after Trump announced on Thursday that he is pausing for a month tariffs on some products from Canada and Mexico.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nCanada's Liberal Party has selected banking executive Mark Carney as its new leader, who will take over from Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauand handle trade and tariff talks with PresidentDonald Trumpat least until Canada's next general election later this year.\n\nNewsweekreached out to the White House on Sunday evening by email for comment.\n\nTrudeau announced his resignationfollowing turmoil in his party over his response to his handling of the nation's budget.\n\nTrudeau directly cited \"internal battles\" as the reason why he felt he could not lead the party into the next general election, which was expected to happen around October this year, but the new prime minister could call an election sooner if he so chooses.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has repeatedly targeted Canada with tariffs since taking office in January, including thethreat of a 250% tariffon American dairy products going across the northern border, which could start as soon as this week.\n\nTrump also has repeatedly talked about his desire to make Canada part of the United States, but the idea has been roundlyrejected by Liberals and Conservatives, with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre insisting: \"We will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country.\"\n\nCarney won the party leadership on March 9 in a clear victory with 131,674 votes from party members, with 85.9 percent of the vote. Former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland got 11,134 votes, giving her second place with 8 percent of the vote.\n\nHe will take over from Trudeau after the party organizes a transition process. It remains unclear how long the process will take or how long Carney will remain prime minister of Canada.\n\nDuring his victory speech, Carney took aim at both Trump and Poilievre, accusing both of seeking to undermine the nation's economy in order to achieve their goals. Carney defied them both to try.\n\n\"There's someone who's trying to weaken our economy: Donald Trump, and Donald Trump, as we know, has put, as the prime minister just said, unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living,\" Carney said.\n\n\"He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed, and we won't the I am proud,\" Carney continued. \"I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt. I am grateful for how our provinces are stepping up to the fight, because when we are united, we are Canada strong,\" adding that \"my government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect.\"\n\nHe later said of Poilievre that he is \"the type of lifelong politician, and I've seen this type around the world, a lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.\"\n\n\"And now in the face of President Trump's threats, Pierre Poilievre still refuses to get his security clearance at a time when our national security is under threat and has never been before,\" Carney said. \"At a time of immense economic insecurity, he would undermine the Bank of Canada.\"\n\n\"I know that these are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\" Carney said as he closed out his speech. \"We are getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\n\nCarney is an economist who has served as the governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.\n\nCarney positioned himself as the person best-equipped to face-off with Trump in the growing tariff and trade war, and the party appears to agree. He beat out Freeland who resigned as finance minister in January amid a falling out with Trudeau over his response to Trump's tariffs.\n\nSome polling indicatesthat with Carney in charge, the Liberal Party could run a close election against the rival Conservative Party, which previously appeared poised to take control of the government once Canadians held their next General Election.\n\nOne of Carney's key promisesis to \"make Canada the strongest economy in the G7,\" which may indicate intent on Carney and the Liberal Party's part to lean into an anti-U.S. stance to tap into the nation's concerns about Trump.\n\nCarney has repeatedly posted on X, formerlyTwitter, about Trump, and spoken about his intent for how to handle the president once he secured the election.\n\n\"President Trump thinks we're pushovers,\" Carneyposted on February 1. \"He doesn't know Canadians. We will stand up for our country. We will stand united. We will get stronger. Together.\"\n\nHe also took a shot at Trump's penchant for using social media to announce policy, writing on February 22: \"Canadians don't want to check social media every morning to see what President Trump might do to our economy. This is Canada — and we will decide our future.\"\n\nIn alengthy post on February 10, Carney warned that Trump wanted to see Canada \"lose our cool\" and urged the nation to \"stay united, with the right response.\"\n\n\"In the short term, Canada needs to manage foreign trade threats with dollar-for-dollar tariffs and supports for our critical steel and aluminum workers,\" he wrote. \"And as we look to the future, we'll need a coordinated strategy to boost investment, make our companies more competitive, and diversify our trading partners.\"\n\nInanother post just a day later, Carney wrote: \"President Trump seems to think he can suspend the laws of the United States, of international trade, and of economics. The AmericanCongressand US courts will decide for themselves how they will address these violations of Presidential powers.\"\n\nHe continued: \"President Trump's actions will hurt millions of Americans workers and all American consumers. And after promising to reduce inflation, his actions will send it and interest rates up. In Canada, we understand the laws of economics. That's why we will be masters of our own house in building the strongest economy in the G7.\"\n\nCarney will take over from Trudeau this week and begin handling talks with Trump and the U.S. as well as other international allies.\n\nUpdate, 3/9/25 at 7:30 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comments from Mark Carney from his victory speech.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nPeter Aitken is a Newsweek Politics Editor based in New York.

        "source_3": "Canada‘s Liberal Party will select a new leader to replaceJustin Trudeauon Sunday night, with that candidate likely to become the next prime minister of Canada, who will have to face the latest sovereignty andtariffthreats from theTrump administration.\n\nTrudeau, who served a decade as prime minister and 12 years as leader of the Liberals, announced in January he would resign from office. His departure from leadership opened up a competitive race between the top two candidates: Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland.\n\nBoth have insisted they arecapable of standing up to President Donald Trump, who has spent his first six weeks threatening as much as 25% tariffs against countries such as Canada and Mexico as an incentive to work with the United States on stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and fentanyl across the borders.\n\nCarney, 59, is the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. Previously, he served as a senior official in the country’s Finance Department under successive Liberal and Conservative governments.\n\nA more establishment candidate, Carney has centered much of his campaign on theeconomy, as the high cost of living has become a top concern for Canadians due to inflation and low productivity. He’s promised to remove Trudeau’s carbon tax and replace it with a pricing system that would require industrial polluters to pay consumers to reduce carbon footprints.\n\nFreeland, 56, is the former finance minister and former foreign minister. She has a successful background in international journalism but has been a staple in Canadian politics for the past decade. Her previous ministry roles are being scrutinized during the election, with detractors arguing she did not stand up to Trudeau when his policies were viewed as unpopular.\n\nIt was Freeland’s resignation from the Cabinet of Canada in December that prompted Trudeau’s own decision to step down. She cited differences with Trudeau over how to deal with Trump’s tariffs threats in her resignation letter.\n\nFreeland has worked to establish herself as the grassroots candidate and said she is the best person to stand up to Trump, particularly about thepresident‘s calls for Canada to become the U.S.’s 51st state. While the sovereignty challenge has been mostly considered bluster, some of Trump’s right-flank allies in Congress have signaled their support.\n\nIf Freeland were to become the new prime minister, she’d already be starting off on the wrong foot with the president — he’scalledher “toxic,” “a whack,” and “incompetent” in recent months. Her priorities include tackling the country’s physician shortage, increasing military spending, and countering foreign interference in politics.\n\nThe latter campaign policy is particularly timely, as it comes after Trudeau’s government was found to be “insufficiently transparent” about foreign interference and sometimes took “too long to act” against attempts from China and India to meddle in elections. A commission released itsfinal reportof an 18-month investigation in January, which encouraged stricter rules for political parties and third-party financing.\n\nBoth Carney and Freeland have been political successes in their own ways. Freeland successfully renegotiated the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement during Trump’s first term. Carney helped Canada through the 2008 financial crisis and steered Britain during Brexit.\n\nLiberal Party members began voting online for their new leader on Feb. 26, using a ranked-choice voting system. The process has been scrutinized in both Canada and the United States, with Canadians worried about technical glitches in the identity verification process. Results are expected around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nWhat happens after the leader is selected depends on the victorious candidate. Carney, who is unelected, would call for federal elections soon after being named prime minister, his campaign indicated to theNew York Times.Freeland told the outlet said she’d weigh the choices of whether to hold a quick election given the continual threat of tariffs from Trump.\n\nPer the country’s laws, federal elections must be held by October. Polling showed the Conservatives were up 20 to 30 points earlier this year, but polls published in early March and late February showed the race narrowing to a toss-up. An Ipsos poll last week showed Liberals with their first election lead since 2021, with 38% support compared to 36% for Conservatives — a 4-point swing from the last Ipsos poll released two weeks prior.\n\nSurveysshow that most respondents would choose Carney over Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party; voters would also select Freeland over the Conservative leader, though by anarrower margin. Polls also indicate voters would prefer both Carney and Freeland to negotiate with Trump over Poilievre."
