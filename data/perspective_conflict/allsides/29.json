        "source_1": "A federal judge in Boston has widened her block on the Trump administration’s ability to enforce a provision of President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy law that would defund Planned Parenthood’s health care services.\n\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani ruled last week that the administration couldn’t enforce the funding ban against some Planned Parenthood organizations. In a newpreliminary injunction issued Monday, the judge blocked enforcement of the law nationwide, saying it applied to the dozens of state and local Planned Parenthood member organizations.\n\n“Patients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable. In particular, restricting Members’ ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs,” Talwani, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, wrote in the 58-page ruling.\n\nThe measure, part of Trump’s domestic policy bill that wassigned into lawJuly 4, bars Medicaid users from coverage with a health care provider that also provides abortion services.\n\nThe judge said that the plaintiffs in the case – the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah – were likely to succeed on their claim that the law had singled out the health care provider for adverse treatment.\n\n“The legislative history and context confirm that the law’s purpose is to single out Planned Parenthood Federation and its Members for punishment,” Talwani wrote, going on to note that comments by individual lawmakers “support the conclusion that Congress’s intent was punitive.”\n\nWhile the legislation did not explicitly mention Planned Parenthood, it prohibits federal funding for providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care” that also provide abortion services.”",

The case stems from a provision in Trump’s tax bill that eliminates Medicaid reimbursements to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in 2023 for one year, regardless of the other services the provider offered.\n\n“The court’s order does not require the federal government to spend money not already appropriated for Medicaid or any other funds,” Talwani wrote. “Instead, this order grants preliminary relief that prevents Defendants from targeting a specific group of entities — Planned Parenthood Federation Members — for exclusion from reimbursements under the Medicaid program where Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood that they will succeed in establishing that such targeted exclusion violated the United States Constitution, and where Plaintiffs satisfy the remaining requirements to obtain a preliminary injunction.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utahfileda joint lawsuit against Robert F.

This ruling undermines state flexibility and disregards longstanding concerns about accountability.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.\n\nPro-choice supporters and staff of Planned Parenthood hold a rally outside the Planned Parenthood Reproductive Health Services Center in St. Louis, Missouri, May 31, 2019, the last location in the state performing abortions, after a US Court announced the clinic could continue operating. – A US Court on May 31, 2019 blocked Missouri from closing the clinic.

Two Houston locations also announced last week that they will close in the upcoming months,accordingto the Houston Chronicle.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
