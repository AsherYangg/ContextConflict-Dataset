        "source_1": "The 2025 4 Nations Face-Off in Montreal on Saturday pitted the United States against Canada in an elite hockey matchup that kicked off with three fights among rivals on each side in the first nine seconds.\n\nJust after the puck dropped, and two seconds into the game, Matthew Tkachuk of the U.S. squad and Brandon Hagel of Team Canada dropped their gloves and went at it, broadcast video of the game showed.\n\nThen Brady Tkachuk, brother of Matthew, and Canada’s Sam Bennett, a forward who plays for the Florida Panthers, went at it.\n\nFinally, New York Rangers forward J.T. Miller and Colton Parayko, a Canadian who’s an alternate captain for the St. Louis Blues, exchanged not-so pleasantries.\n\nMiller was penalized for his part, and the game went on.\n\nBefore the puck had dropped and the players had scuffled, it was the Canadian fans who showed their displeasure with Team USA, booing during “The Star-Spangled Banner” and as the American players were introduced.\n\nThis comes amid President Donald Trump’s remarks that Canada should become a U.S. state — remarksmany Canadians find deeply insulting— and as the Trump administrationthreatens tariffs on its neighbor to the north.\n\nOn Saturday night, once all the dust had settled, it was the Americans who came out on top, securing a 3-1 victory over Canada and a spot in the tournament final.\n\nThe tournament also features teams from Finland and Sweden and is being played this month at Montreal’s Bell Center and Boston’s TD Garden, with the championship game scheduled for Thursday in Boston. Team USA’s opponent is yet to be determined.\n\nDennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\nRebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.",

This was widely interpreted as a direct response to Trump's tariffs on Canada.\n\n\"US anthem being booed at the Raptors-Clippers game,\" sports reporter Michael Grangeposted to X, formerlyTwitter. \"This has nothing to do with [Clippers star small forward] Kawhi Leonard and is more about US imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports and the US president musing about taking us over.\"\n\nIndicating that this may become a staple at events involving both nations, spectators also booed when Agasha Mutesasira began her performance of the U.S. anthem in Vancouver, British Columbia, prior to anNHLmatchup between the Vancouver Canucks and the Detroit Red Wings at the Rogers Arena.\n\nIn response to the Saturday incident,author Nick Adamsposted to X: \"Team USA defeats Canada 3-1 in Montreal. Canadians booed our national anthem, so we decided to dominate them at their own game. Mr. President, we are still not sick and tired of winning!\"\n\n\"One of the most meaningful wins in U.S. hockey history,\"another accountwrote. \"Our national anthem was disrespected—twice. Their fans trashed our country all week. We walked into their biggest hockey market and beat their national team on their ice. USA showed up tonight.\"\n\nAnti-Trump X accountCall to Activismposted: \"It's makes me so mad and sad to hear Canadians boo the USA national anthem so loudly—because I am mad and sad that Trump ruined our nations' friendship simply because he's f****** stupid.\"\n\n\"You just really hate to see Canada losing in their own barn after relentlessly booing the national anthem,\" aSpokane, Washington, residentwrote, alongside a gif of a smiling grinch. \"Hate to see it.\"\n\nThe X account,Republicans against Trump, wrote: \"Massive, loud boos during the U.S. national anthem at the USA-Canada hockey game in Montreal tonight. Only Donald Trump could make Canadians hate us. Excellent work, Donald.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha Canada you suck,\" another pro-Trump X accountposted. \"America even owned your favorite sport. USA! USA! USA!\"\n\nIn addition to the 25 percent duties on Canada and Mexico, the pause on which is set to expire in early March, Trumprecently announced \"reciprocal\" tariffson all countries seen to be \"ripping off\" the U.S. with their own trade restrictions.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

        "source_3": "Canadian hockey fans booed “The Star-Spangled Banner” — setting off a brawl-filled gamethat ended with a US winSaturday night.\n\nThe game of the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament could have been mistaken for a boxing event — with three fist fights breaking out between American and Canadian players following the widespread booing of the US national anthem by over 20,000 angry fans.\n\nAs soon as the singer, Royal Canadian Air Force member David Grenon, began belting, “Oh, say, can you see,” the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal let out an aggressive and booming chorus of boos that nearly drowned out the anthem entirely.\n\nThe jeers came down torrentially loud when “and the rockets’ red glare,” was sung — the apex of the tune.\n\nBy the end of the anthem, a contingent of US fans made their voices heard briefly but were once again overwhelmed by apparently angry and bitter Canadians.\n\nBy contrast, “Oh, Canada,” the country’s national anthem, wassung throughout the arenawithout booing and with particular patriotic fervor.\n\nThe proud Team USA did not take the affront lying down.\n\nGloves were torn off and fisticuffs flew between US star Matthew Tkachuk and Team Canada’s Brandon Hagel as soon as the first puck dropped  —with two other fights breaking outin the seconds following the first bout.\n\nA total of three fights took place in the first nine seconds of the game.\n\nThe handmade fireworks got lots of Americans heavily invested in the outcome of the game.\n\n“I didn’t care about this USA hockey game but that was 19 fights ago,” Barstool president Dave Portnoywrote on Xbefore live tweeting the rest of the game.\n\n“America beating the s–t out of Canada. 3 fights in 9 seconds, America won all 3, wasn’t even close,” one animated userwrote on X. “Bunch of damn maple syrup drinking, moose riding, leaf loving, commies.”\n\nThe animosity toward the anthem comes as President Trump continues his overtures at making the US’ northern neighbor its 51st state to the chagrin of Canadian citizens.\n\nAs recently as Thursday,Trump insistedthat Canada needs “our protection” and would benefit from joining the US.\n\n“Look, the people would pay much less tax than they’re paying right now, they’d have perfect military protection,” Trump said from the Oval Office to the press.\n\n“Why would we pay $200 billion a year in subsidies to Canada when [they’re] not a state?” Trump asked, referring to the trade deficit the US has with its northern neighbor.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — dubbed “governor” by Trump — was in attendance at the game wearing a jersey with his country’s iconic maple leaf logo.\n\nThe soon-to-be former prime minister posted a video from the game with his son with the caption, “True North, strong and free.”\n\nThe US would rake the Canadian team in an instant classic — winning 3 -1 and clinching a spot in the championship final in Boston on Feb. 20.\n\nThe game-winner was scored by Michigan native Dylan Larkin, captain of the Detroit Red Wings."
