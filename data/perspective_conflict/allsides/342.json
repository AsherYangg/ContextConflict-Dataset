    "question": "What implications could Vivek Ramaswamy’s gubernatorial campaign—centered on cutting regulations and costs, reshaping education, and attracting tech entrepreneurs, and informed by his work on DOGE—have for Ohio’s policy priorities and political landscape heading into 2026?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Donald Trump is making sure Vivek Ramaswamy doesn’t come anywhere near the White House.\n\nThe president endorsed Ramaswamy for governor of Ohio on Monday night, a position the biotech entrepreneur pivoted to after being abruptly ousted as DOGE co-lead, likely in part due to his feuding with Elon Musk and calling white Americans lazy, stupid jocks.\n\n“VIVEK RAMASWAMY is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio. I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He’s Young, Strong, and Smart!” Trumppostedon Truth Social. “Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country. He will be a GREAT Governor of Ohio, will never let you down, and has my COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT!”\n\nThis entire gubernatorial bid seems to have stemmed from a series of iconically disastrousX posts,in which Ramaswamy opined that “our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.… A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ or ‘Stefan’ over Steve Urkel in ‘Family Matters,’ will not produce the best engineers.”\n\nThis, along with whatThe Washington Postcalleda “deep philosophical rift” with Elon Musk, eventually got Ramaswamy sent to the toil in the Midwest.\n\nRamaswamy is likely to face various other Republican primary challengers in Ohio, a state Trump carried by 11 points in 2024. Former state health director Amy Acton is the likely Democratic nominee.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton thinks that Donald Trump’s mind is deteriorating, based on some of his recent comments.\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Bolton in an interview Monday night whether Trump actually thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t a dictator, or is refraining from saying so because it’s a negotiating strategy. Bolton didn’t mince words.\n\n“I think it’s an indication his mind is full of mush, and he says whatever comes into it. He believes Vladimir Putin is his friend, and you know, you don’t call your friends a dictator,” Boltonsaid, noting that Trump has disliked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy since the “perfect phone call” from his first term.\n\n“So, it’s no sweat off his back to go ahead and call Zelenskiy a dictator. This is somebody who is not fit to be president. He can’t tell America’s friends from its enemies,” Bolton added.\n\nCollins: Do you believe when trump would not call Putin a dictator earlier— Is that a negotiating strategy, or do you think he just doesn't think he is one?Bolton: I think it's a it's an indication his mind is full of mush. He believes Vladimir Putin is his friend. And, you…pic.twitter.com/j0whEq83KW\n\nCollins also asked Bolton about Trump’s relationship with Lieutenant General Dan Caine, whom Trump has appointed as chair of the joint chiefs of staff. Trump unceremoniously fired the previous chair, General C.Q. Brown, over the weekend. Trump met Caine in Iraq during his first presidential term and said Cainetold himthat the U.S. could have the campaign against ISIS “totally finished in one week.”\n\n“I said, ‘Why didn’t my other generals tell me that? Why didn’t they tell me that?’” Trump said in 2019. Trump has also said that Caine told him he “loved” the president and would “kill for you,” while wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nCollins asked Bolton if Trump is remembering his relationship with Caine correctly, as Bolton was with Trump on the trip to Iraq where the president and Caine met.\n\n“Absolutely not. Trump has made up events that didn’t happen. We were on the ground in Iraq, I don’t know, maybe three hours total, and I was with Trump every minute of that time on the ground,” Boltonsaid. “There was no chance that Trump had a conversation with General Caine that bore any resemblance to what he’s described. I never saw Caine wear a MAGA hat.\n\n“I think it’s standard Trump. He makes the world as he wants it to be, and then his followers unfortunately believe him,” Bolton added.\n\nCollins: His name is Dan Caine. They met in Iraq six years, six years ago when trump was last in office. You were actually there on that that visit.. Is the way that trump portrays that relationship what you witnessed?Bolton: Absolutely not. Trump has made up events that didn't…pic.twitter.com/fwJkCd9uy2\n\nIf Bolton is right, Trump has altered the military chain of command because of an inaccurate memory of an incident from nearly seven years ago. That is a worrying thought for American national security and for the country as a whole. Trump seems to be replacing anyone who could check his power, and if hismind is going, what does the future hold?\n\nThe American checks and balances system is waking up.\n\nOn Monday, two different decisions—one from a federal judge and the other from an independent government watchdog agency—came down to limit the power of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nU.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman issued atemporary restraining orderthat blocks DOGE from accessing and sharing sensitive records from the Office of Personnel Management and the Education Department.\n\n“Specifically, the plaintiffs have shown that Education and OPM likely violated the Privacy Act by disclosing their personal information to DOGE affiliates without their consent,” Boardman wrote in the restraining order.\n\nMultiple labor unions have sued DOGE on the grounds that it was trying to get into databases that held people’s Social Security numbers, banking information, and other “extraordinarily sensitive records of millions of Americans.”\n\nBoardman noted that the unions had “met their burden for the extraordinary relief they seek,” and would suffer “irreparable harm” if DOGE wasn’t stopped. “There is no reason to believe their access to this information will end anytime soon because the government believes their access is appropriate,” she wrote.\n\nThe second loss for DOGE and Musk was handed down by the Office of Special Counsel, which helps protect government employees from illegal treatment. On Friday (although it wasn’t released until Monday), the office ruled that DOGE violated protocol in its firing of six employees—and the decision could have implications for the hundreds of thousands of other federal employees who were also fired by Musk and DOGE for “poor performance.”\n\nOSC head Hampton Dellingerruledthat “there are reasonable grounds to believe that agencies engaged in prohibited personnel practices (PPPs) … by terminating the employees in violation of federal laws and regulations governing probationary terminations and reductions in force.”\n\n“Firing probationary employees without individualized cause appears contrary to a reasonable reading of the law, particularly the provisions establishing rules for reductions in force,” Dellingersaid in a statementon Monday. “Because Congress has directed that OSC ‘shall’ protect government employees from PPPs, I believe I have a responsibility to request a stay of these actions while my agency continues to investigate further the apparent violation of federal personnel laws.”\n\nDellinger stated that the employees were obviously not fired for “poor performance.” And if it was for a lack of resources (rather than purely political reasons), then Dellinger noted that Musk and DOGE must go through the normal justification process for the firings.\n\n“There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Agencies improperly circumvented [reduction in force] regulations by terminating Complainants and other probationary employees en masse without regard to each employee’s individual performance for the purpose of restructuring government agencies and reducing costs,” Dellinger wrote.\n\nThese are the first of many lawsuits against DOGE and the broader Trump administration. Whether they set a firm anti-purge precedent or simply serve as minor roadblocks remains to be seen.\n\nDonald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin need to get their story straight, because they’re both telling different tales about negotiations to end Russia’s violent incursion into Ukraine.\n\nTrumpbraggedMonday about working with Putin while recapping his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and other G7 leaders about next steps to deescalate the war in Ukraine.\n\n“I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia,” Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social. “Talks are proceeding very well!”\n\nBut, surprise, surprise, it seems Putin is on an entirely different page.\n\nDuring remarks on Russian state television Monday, Putin said he had yet to have any detailed talks with Trump about ending the conflict in Ukraine, according to theAssociated Press.\n\nThe autocrat added that Russian and American negotiating teams hadn’t discussed ending the war, either, during ameetingin Saudi Arabia last week.\n\nSo which is it, “serious discussions” or conversations lacking in details? The muddled answers could suggest something is awry in negotiations, if one can even call Trump’s endless capacity for caving to Putin’s every demand a negotiation.\n\nThere’s reason to believe that Trump’s supposed statesmanship might be falling apart. Last week, TrumpaccusedUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of being responsible for Russia’s invasion, enjoying a “gravy train” from the United States, and even calling him a “Dictator Without Elections.”\n\nDuring their joint press conference Monday, Macron was forced to fact-check Trump, after the presidentmisrepresentedthe agreement they had just made.\n\nDonald Trump ramped up his outlandish claims of widespread fraud on Monday, claiming that the government was paying fake people not to work.\n\nDuring apress conference, Trump cobbled together an explanation for Elon Musk’s contentious email to federal workers from the Office of Personnel Management Friday asking them to explain five things they accomplished last week. On X, Musk later claimed that failing to respond would be tantamount to a resignation.\n\nFederal workers have alleged the threat wasillegal; meanwhile, Trump said that there was “a lot of genius in sending it,” because it would help root out what he described as nonexistent government workers.\n\n“You know why he wanted that, by the way? I thought it was great, because we have people who don’t show up to work, and nobody even knows if they work for the government,” Trumpsaid. “So, by asking the question, ‘Tell us what you did this week,’ what he’s doing is saying, ‘Are you actually working?’ And then, if you don’t answer, like, you’re sort of semi-fired or you’re fired, because a lot of people are not answering because they don’t even exist.\n\n“That’s how badly various parts of our government were run by, and especially by this last group. So, what they’re doing is trying to find out who’s working for the government, are we paying other people that aren’t working, and where is all this—where has the money gone?”\n\nTrump: \"By asking the question, 'Tell us what you did this week?' What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semifired or you're fired, because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist.\"pic.twitter.com/lCRUNCzCHj\n\nTrump claimed that his administration had already uncovered “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud,” but of course, to Trump, fraud isn’t actually fraud, it’s just any federal spending he does not agree with—any cuts can be justified post hoc by claiming “fraud.”\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Trump’s claim that there are fictional people on the government payroll, but then again, his administration has providedno evidencefor any of its supposedly mounting claims of fraud in the past two months.\n\nMusk’s email is simply the latest plot to arbitrarily slash the federal workforce, after the administration’s sketchy buyout scheme and mass firings recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency. Now it seems that Musk and Trump are hoping to create a context to justify the mass firing of federal workers.\n\nIn that same vein, Muskannouncedin a post on X Monday that any federal worker who did not return to in-person work this week would be placed on administrative leave. Last month, Trump signed an executive order telling federal workers that they needed to return to work onsite, or be terminated.\n\nMeanwhile, OPMtoldagency heads Monday that responding to Musk’s email was “voluntary,” and that employees would not be fired if they did not respond.\n\nThe nation’s H.R. leaders suddenly don’t seem keen to obey Elon Musk’sweekend threat.\n\nResponding to the president’s request that he become “more aggressive” in sizing down the federal government, Musk wrote in a social media post Saturday that all federal employees must self-report five things that they achieved in the previous week before midnight on Monday or face immediate termination.\n\nFederal workers reportedly received an email from the Office of Personnel Management shortly afterward that echoed Musk’s post. But by Monday, many federal agencies fronted by Donald Trump’s own appointees had simply told their staffers not to respond. Those included the Department of Defense, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and most recently, curiously, the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n“This afternoon, OPM during a Chief Human Capital Officers Council meeting, informed agencies that employee responses to the OPM email is voluntarily,” the agency said in an internal email obtained byThe Hill.\n\n“OPM also clarified that a non-response to the email does not equate to a resignation,” the email continued.\n\nThe stance is a stunning about-face for an agency that has otherwise seemed thoroughly under Musk’s control.\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel similarly instructed the bureau not to follow Musk’s demands, telling agents that “when and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”\n\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of our review processes and will conduct reviews,” Patel said.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department wrote in astatementthat “no employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.”\n\nMusk has acknowledged the similarities between the threat to federal employees and his treatment of Twitter staffers during his takeover of the company in 2022, when he fired the social media company’s former chief executive, Parag Agrawal, after publicly accusing him of failing to accomplish his weekly goals.\n\n“Parag got nothing done. Parag was fired,” Musk wrote on X Saturday.\n\nDonald Trump’s freeze on foreign aid is hurting one of his majorcampaign promises: taking on fentanyl and ending overdose deaths from the drug in the U.S.\n\nReuters reports that a United Nations counternarcotics program that seeks to stop fentanyl chemicals from reaching Mexico’s drug cartels has beenheld upby Trump’s aid freeze, citing eight unnamed sources. The effort gave the Mexican navy training and equipment to boost screening at Mexico’s busiest container port, the Port of Manzanillo. Two more Mexican ports were supposed to be added to the initiative this month until funding was cut off.\n\nThe U.S. provided $800,000 in funding to launch the project in 2023 at the Port of Manzanillo, which is used heavily by Mexican drug cartels to sneak in Chinese chemicals used to help manufacture opioids and methamphetamine. Drug traffickers have also used cargo ships leaving the port to stash finished drugs headed overseas. More cargo scanners and drug-testing equipment were supposed to arrive at the Port of Manzanillo before the freeze as well.\n\nTrump’s interruption of foreign aid has also hurt other U.S.anti-drug effortsin Mexico, including a program to train Mexican law enforcement to find and take down hidden fentanyl labs as well as donations of drug-sniffing dogs to the country.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has scrambled to resume other anti-fentanyl programs with Mexico, including $7.8 million in funding for the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs “to counter production and trafficking of fentanyl and to dismantle terrorist criminal organizations,” the rest of the bureau’s $50 million in funding is frozen.\n\nLast week, the Trump administrationlabeled8 Latin American drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations” as part of its efforts to combat drug trafficking and migrant smuggling, stepping up itsmilitary actionsin Mexico as well. But Trump may soon find that counterterrorism mixed withtariffs threatsis no replacement for badly needed aid.\n\n“Stopping all these programs at this moment, I just don’t see how this is going to have a positive impact on reducing the numbers of fentanyl deaths in the U.S.,” a former State Department official, Enrique Roig, told Reuters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump capped a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron Monday by writing a lengthy post on his social media platform—though details regarding a potential Ukraine-Russia peace deal didn’t just appear to favor Russia but also hinted at larger economic goals with America’s longtime adversary.\n\n“Today, President Emmanuel Macron of France joined me in the Oval Office to speak to the G7 Summit,” Trumppostedon Truth Social. “The meeting was convened by Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, the current chair of G7, to acknowledge the Third Anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine War—Which would have never started if I was President.”\n\nTrump then went on to write that everyone in attendance at the meeting wanted to see an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump also noted that he “emphasized the importance” of the proposed “Critical Minerals and Rare-Earths Deal” between the United States and Ukraine, which wouldfunnel halfof the Eastern European nation’s rare earth minerals—hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of materials used in tech and electronic products—into the American market.\n\nTrump has pitched the deal as a way for the U.S. to recoup financial and military assistance it provided to Ukraine, while Ukrainian officials see the trade arrangement as a way tosolidifya long-term relationship with an increasingly Russian-friendly U.S. president.\n\nTrump has previously and incorrectly claimed that the U.S. provided some $350 billion to Ukraine. In actuality, the U.S. has allocated $119 billion in Ukraine aid, according to theKiel Institute, which has been tracking international financial assistance for Ukraine.\n\nStill, Trump made it perfectly clear who the priority would be in the ongoing peace talks.\n\n“At the same time, I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia,” Trump said. “Talks are proceeding very well!”\n\nReal estate developer turned U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff spoke with Russian officialslast weekregarding a potential peace deal. While speaking about the meeting with CNN’sState of the Unionon Sunday, Trump’s longtime friend couldn’t detail one thing that Russia would actually have to compromise on in the arrangement.\n\nRussian forces crossed the Ukrainian border on February 24, 2022, which Putin tried to justify by falsely claiming that he needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia opened discussions at a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, seeking a conclusion to the three-year war, but the assembly conspicuously excluded Ukrainian leadership.\n\nWhile speaking at a NATO summit earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth explicitly outlined that the Trump administration’s peace talks with Russia had taken several bargaining chips “off the table.”\n\nThose included Ukraine’s possible NATO membership (something the military alliance had promised in 2008), the possibility of a U.S. military presence in Ukraine to enforce postwar security guarantees, and the end of NATO missions to Ukraine. Hegseth also added that it would be “unrealistic” for Ukraine to return to its prewar borders, effectively ceding land to Moscow.\n\nThe announcement came as a complete 180 on American and NATO policy regarding the Eastern European country, and left U.S. allies and defense experts reeling. The deal, per Trump’s former national security adviserJohn Bolton, amounted to Russian propaganda and was practically “written in the Kremlin.”\n\nRon DeSantis is scrambling after Donald Trump upended his plans to make DeSantis’s wife his successor for governor of Florida with a single Truth Social post.\n\n“I am hearing that Highly Respected Congressman Byron Donalds is considering running for Governor of Florida, a State that I love, and WON BIG in 2016, 2020, and 2024,” Trumpwroteon Truth Social on Thursday. “I know Byron well, have seen him tested at the highest and most difficult levels, and he is a TOTAL WINNER! ... As Governor, Byron would have a BIG Voice, and would work closely with me to advance our America First Agenda.… Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, BYRON, RUN!”\n\nThis ringing endorsement is an indirect rejection of DeSantis, with whom Donalds had a public feud after he endorsed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican primary. And it’s a direct rejection of DeSantis’s wife, Casey.\n\n​​“[Casey is] somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,” DeSantistoldreporters on Monday. “Anything we’ve accomplished, she’d be able to take to the next level.”\n\n“The reality is we’ve achieved victories in Florida.… A guy like Byron, he just hasn’t been a part of any of the victories that we’ve had here over the left over these last years,” DeSantis said. “He’s just not been a part of it. He’s been in other states campaigning doing that and that’s fine, but OK, then deliver results up there.”\n\nShamed former attorney general nominee and Florida Republican Matt Gaetzchimedin on X: “Man it hurts me to see this [sad emoji]. Governor DeSantis, don’t you remember when you,@ByronDonaldsand I were working collaboratively to get you elected in 2018?  We literally were your debate prep team.”\n\nDeSantis has long tried to keep one foot in the MAGA pool and another in classic conservatism. That tightrope act may come to a head in 2028 as the GOP makes critical choices about its post-Trump future.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macronvisitedthe White House on Monday, and during a press conference in the Oval Office, he was forced to correct President Trump on Ukraine.\n\nTrump remarked that “Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They get their money back.” Macron immediately set the record straight, touching Trump’s arm as he explained the truth.\n\n“No, in fact, to be frank. We paid. We paid 60 percent of the total effort, and it was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantee, grants, and we provided real money, to be clear,” Macron said.\n\nTrump wasn’t satisfied with this explanation, and latersaid, “But they get their money back, we don’t, and now we do, but that’s only fair.”\n\nNotable moment in the Oval Office where Trump says “Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine” and “they’re getting their money back” when Macron interrupted to say, “No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort.”pic.twitter.com/QFzv9WhsIz\n\nTrump hasattackedUkraine in recent days, accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of being responsible for Russia’s invasion, enjoying a “gravy train” from the United States, and even calling him a “Dictator Without Elections.” Trump also heldnegotiationswith Russia last week about ending the Ukraine war without representatives from Ukraine or the European Union.\n\nThe apparent shift in U.S. policy has causedalarmin Europe, with European leadersscramblingto adjust. Macron is partly traveling to the U.S. to convince Trump of the danger of Russia to Europe and to convince him to continue supporting Ukraine. Based on Monday’s press conference, it’s not clear if Macron will have much success.",

Ramaswamy, for his part, had expressed interest in serving in the Senate.\n\nDeWine's decision to choose Husted to fill the vacant Senate seat appeared to accelerate Ramaswamy's move toward launching a run for governor.\n\nRamaswamy was raised in Evendale, Ohio, in suburban Cincinnati by parents who emigrated from India.

Tim Ryan, the 2022 Democratic Senate nominee in Ohio, is possibly considering a gubernatorial bid, as well as Chris Redfern, a former longtime state representative and former state Democratic Party chair.\n\nFormer Ohio Health Director Amy Acton, who was one of the prominent faces of the COVID-19 response in the state, has announced she is running for governor as a Democrat.\n\nAs Fox News confirmed last month, leading members ofVice President JD Vance'spolitical team, including two top advisors, are helping Ramaswamy's gubernatorial bid.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy arrives to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nThe two Vance advisors are Andy Surabian and Jai Chabria, who played major roles in Vance's 2022 Senate race and in his vice presidential campaign last summer and autumn, after Trump named the first-term senator as his running mate.\n\nTony Fabrizio, the veteran Republican pollster who worked on Trump’s 2016 and 2024 campaigns, as well as Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign, is also helping Ramaswamy, as is Arthur Schwartz, who along with Surabian is a close ally to Vance and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe vice president, who has known Ramaswamy since they both studied at Yale Law School, has put his imprint on Ohio politics since winning his 2022 Senate election.\n\nVance endorsed now-Sen. Bernie Moreno ahead of his 2024 GOP Senate primary victory, and key members of Vance's political team steered Moreno's campaign.\n\n\"We don’t have to be a state in decline,\" Ramaswamy said on Monday. \"A decade from now, when we cure a genetic disease; when we send rockets to Mars; when we power our electric grid with nuclear fusion…the thing people are going to say is ‘that’s so Ohio.’ And this is just the beginning.\"\n\nPaul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.
