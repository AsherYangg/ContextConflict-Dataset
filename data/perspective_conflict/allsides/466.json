I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew in my brain that he was a good one. About as good as it gets,\" he said.\n\n\"And we love the family.

The former president was able to point to the reversal of some of his key policies as reasons why inflation rose and the U.S. border crisis worsened.\n\nTrump faced a crowded GOP primary field, but emerged as the frontrunner yet again, easily defeating his opponents – all of whom eventually endorsed him to be the 47th President of the United States – and winning each primary contest.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nUntil July, Trump was running against Biden, who was seeking re-election for a second term.\n\nBut the two debated for the first time in June, and weeks later, after a disastrous debate performance, Biden was pressured by Democrat insiders to suspend his presidential bid.\n\nBIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP\n\nBiden made the announcement in a social media post and endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in his place, moving his vice president to the top of the ticket.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, left, kisses Melania Trump at an election night watch party, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(Alex Brandon / AP)\n\nThe decision for Biden to drop out of the race came just days after the Republican National Convention (RNC) finished, and after Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, formally accepted the GOP nomination.\n\nBut Trump, just days before accepting the Republican nomination, survived an assassination attempt at a rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. During the event, Trump was showing off a chart highlighting how illegal immigration skyrocketed under the Biden-Harris administration. As he turned toward the chart, he was hit by a bullet that pierced the upper part of his right ear by the now-deceased would-be-assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Trump credits the chart for saving his life.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE WAS 'SHOT WITH A BULLET' IN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AT PENNSYLVANIA RALLY\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks accompanied by Melania Trump, Barron Trump, Vice Presidential Nominee Senator JD Vance, Usha Chilukuri Vance, and Ivanka Trump, following early results from the 2024 U.S. presidential election in Palm Beach County Convention Center, in West Palm Beach, Florida, Nov. 6, 2024.(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nBut weeks later, in September, another would-be-assassin hid himself in the bushes at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, had an AK-47-style rifle pointing through the fence toward Trump as he was golfing. Trump was rushed off the golf course by U.S. Secret Service agents unharmed.\n\nTRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS 'RHETORIC' FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL 'SAVE THE COUNTRY'\n\nJust a day later, Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that the \"rhetoric\" of Biden, Harris and the Democrats was to blame.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump takes the stage with his wife Melania and son Barron to address supporters at his rally, at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, Nov. 6, 2024.(Brian Snyder / Reuters)\n\n\"He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,\" Trump said of the gunman. \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country – both from the inside and out.\"\n\nThe general election showcased two very different visions for the future of the United States of America.\n\nThe Trump campaign touted pro-growth, America first economic policies, securing the border, ending inflation, and restoring \"peace through strength\" as part of the president's plan.\n\nThe Trump campaign’s closing message was: \"Harris broke it. Trump will fix it.\"\n\nSecret Service agents tend to a wounded Trump onstage at a rally on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nTRUMP MAKES FRIES AT PENNSYLVANIA MCDONALD'S: 'I'VE NOW WORKED FOR 15 MINUTES MORE THAN KAMALA'\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to work at a McDonald's drive-thru window as a fry cook in a jab at Harris, who previously claimed that she worked at the fast-food chain.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris campaigned that Trump was a threat to democracy and warned supporters that he would sign a national abortion ban – something Trump repeatedly denied.\n\nAs for the rhetoric, it never quite fizzled. Trump held a massive, sold-out campaign rally just a week before Election Day at Madison Square Garden in traditionally blue New York City. Democrats, including Harris, later likened Trump to \"Hitler.\"\n\nTRUMP, POWERHOUSE GUESTS ROCK PACKED MSG WITH HISTORIC RALLY\n\nAnd less than a week before Election Day, Biden described Trump supporters as \"garbage.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and former first lady Melania Trump look on during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nTrump landed key endorsements from top Republicans during his bid for the White House but also created unlikely allies, like former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nTrump also drew support from top business leaders like Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. Lutnick told Fox News Digital that many Wall Street leaders had privately committed their support to Trump.\n\nTrump supporters outside of Madison Square Garden.(Fox News Digital )\n\nTrump’s victory comes after years of what his campaign called a \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department.\n\nTrump’s post-presidential life and third campaign was reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by investigations, which the former president and his allies said were just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running forre-election in 2024.\n\nTrump, who was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached and acquitted twice, was also the first president to be indicted, not just once, but four times over.\n\nTRUMP IMMUNITY CASE: SUPREME COURT RULES EX-PRESIDENTS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PROTECTION FROM PROSECUTION\n\nJust days after announcing his re-election bid in November 2022, Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland tapped former DOJ official Jack Smith as special counsel. The appointment came several months after the FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, claiming he improperly retained classified records from his presidency. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming from that probe.\n\nThe case was eventually tossed completely by a federal judge in Florida, who ruled that Smith was improperly and unlawfully appointed as special counsel.\n\nSmith also took over an investigation into alleged 2020 election interference. Trump also pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys took the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court to argue on the basis of presidential immunity.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump takes the stage with his wife Melania and son Barron to address supporters at his rally, at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., November 6, 2024.(Brian Snyder / Reuters)\n\nThe high court ruled that Trump was immune from prosecution for official presidential acts, forcing Smith to file a new indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to those new charges as well. Trump attorneys are now seeking to have the election interference charges dropped in Washington, D.C., similarly alleging that Smith was appointed unlawfully.\n\nTRUMP SAYS SUPREME COURT RULING IN COLORADO CASE IS 'UNIFYING AND INSPIRATIONAL'\n\nBut that case wasn’t the first Trump-related Supreme Court ruling this election cycle. Colorado, attempting to use the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, sought to remove Trump from the 2024 primary ballot, but the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the former president, impacting efforts in several other states to do the same.\n\nIn 2023, Trump was charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with allegedly falsifying business records. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges but sat through an unprecedented six-week criminal trial in New York City this spring. The jury found him guilty.\n\nTrump appealed the ruling, and the judge presiding over the case set his sentencing date for after the election.\n\nTrump also sat inside a courtroom in the fall of 2023 for a civil fraud trial stemming from a lawsuit brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Arthur Engoron demanded Trump pay more than $450 million.\n\nTRUMP SAYS TAKING MUGSHOT WAS 'NOT A COMFORTABLE FEELING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG'\n\nBut a New York appeals court appeared open-minded and receptive in September to reversing or reducing that judgment.\n\nTrump has also appealed a ruling to pay E. Jean Carroll more than $80 million in a defamation suit. As president, Trump said Carroll was lying about allegations of sexual assault. This year, a New York jury ruled that he defamed Carroll’s character in denying the allegations and defending himself.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump takes the stage to address supporters at his rally, at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, Nov. 6, 2024.(Brian Snyder / Reuters)\n\nAnd in Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump in her election interference case. He pleaded not guilty but was booked and had his mugshot taken – a photo his campaign used throughout the election cycle to illustrate the \"lawfare\" used against him.\n\nA Georgia judge tossed a number of charges against Trump, and the case is on hold.\n\nThe future of the cases and charges hang in limbo, as the president-elect will have the power to pardon himself once sworn in.\n\nTrump delivered pizzas to FDNY following a day in court.(Fox News)\n\nBut Trump, through all of the unprecedented legal challenges, took every opportunity to campaign. After hours in court this spring, Trump delivered pizzas to the New York City Fire Department.\n\nTrump told his supporters he thought the prosecutions would have \"the reverse effect\" on his presidential bid – and he was apparently right.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\n\nBrooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
