She was 41.\n\n“It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” read a statement from the family.\n\nPolice confirmed that emergency services found a woman unresponsive in her home near Perth, Western Australia, on Friday night. She was pronounced dead at the scene after first aid was unsuccessful.\n\nHer death is not being treated as suspicious, police said.\n\n“She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” her family said in the statement.\n\n“Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors.”\n\n“In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.”\n\nGiuffre, a mother of three, was one of the most vocal accusers of the wealthy and well-connected sex offender Epstein. In 2019, she publicly alleged Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew, when she was 17 years old.\n\nShe also claimed the prince was aware she was underage in the US at the time.\n\nIn July 2019, Epstein was indicted on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors, to which he pleaded not guilty. One month later, hedied by suicidein prison.\n\nHe was accused of running a child trafficking ring to provide him with girls as young as 14 for sex and nude massages at his homes in New York City and Florida between 2002 and 2005.\n\nA 2009settlementagreement, unsealed in 2022, showed that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop a case without any admission of liability or fault.\n\nPrior to that, Epsteinpleaded guiltyin 2008 to state prostitution charges, one involving a 14-year-old girl, and served 13 months in prison under a controversial plea deal.\n\nHis ex-girlfriendGhislaineMaxwell was arrested in 2020 and accused of facilitating Epstein’s abuse scheme. A jury in 2021convicted her on five federal counts, including sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy. She was sentenced to20 yearsin jail a year later.\n\nGiuffre wasnot one of the four womenwho testified in the trial that they had been abused.\n\nHelp is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.

I will miss her beyond words. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.\"\n\nIn a statement released on Friday Giuffre's family said:\"There are no words that can express the grave loss we feel today with the passing of our sweet Virginia.

We know that she is with the angels.\"\n\nHer attorney, Sigrid McCawley, told People in a statement,\"Virginia was much more than a client to me; she was a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims.
