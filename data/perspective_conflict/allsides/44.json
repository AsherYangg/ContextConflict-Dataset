        "source_1": "The Trump administration has released records of the FBI’s surveillance ofMartin Luther King Jr.,despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate’s family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination.\n\nThe release involves more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977, when the FBI first gathered the records and turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Monday, King’s two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father’s killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.”\n\nThe Kings got advance access to the records and had their own teams reviewing them. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. Among the documents are leads the FBI received after King’s assassination and details of the CIA’s fixation on King’s pivot to international anti-war and anti-poverty movements in the years before he was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King’s life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder.\n\n“As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met — an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family’s continuing grief.”\n\nThey also repeated the family’s long-held contention thatJames Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.\n\nBernice King was 5 years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.\n\nA statement from the office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the disclosure “unprecedented” and said many of the records had been digitized for the first time. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue.\n\nTrump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed anexecutive orderto declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy’s and King’s 1968 assassinations.\n\nThe governmentunsealed the JFK recordsin March anddisclosed some RFK filesin April.\n\nThe announcement from Gabbard’s office included a statement from Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s niece, who is an outspoken conservative and has broken from King’s children on various topics — including the FBI files. Alveda King said she was “grateful to President Trump” for his “transparency.”\n\nSeparately, Attorney GeneralPam Bondi’ssocial media account featured a picture of the attorney general with Alveda King.\n\nBesides fulfilling the intent of his January executive order, the latest release serves as another alternative headline for Trump as he tries to mollify supporters angry over his administration’s handling of records concerning the sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself behind bars while awaiting trial in 2019, during Trump’s first presidency. Trump last Friday ordered the Justice Department to releasegrand jury testimonybut stopped short of unsealing the entire case file.\n\nBernice King and Martin Luther King III did not mention Trump in their statement Monday. But Bernice King later posted on her personal Instagram account a black-and-white photo of her father, looking annoyed, with the caption “Now, do the Epstein files.”\n\nAnd some civil rights activists did not spare the president.\n\n“Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It’s a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base.”\n\nThe King Center, founded by King’s widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction — but from more than short-term political controversy.\n\n“It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK’s efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”\n\nThe King records, meanwhile, were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until Justice Department attorneysasked a federal judgeto lift the sealing order ahead of its expiration date. Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents to find new information about his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThe Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King co-founded in 1957 as the Civil Rights Movement blossomed, opposed the release. They, along with King’s family, argued that the FBI illegally surveilled King and other civil rights figures, tapping their offices and phone lines with the aim of discrediting them and their movement.\n\nIt has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others that he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover’s bureau wiretapped King’s telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to get information against him.\n\n“He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated byJ. Edgar Hooverthrough the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),” the King children said in their statement.\n\n“The intent of the government’s COINTELPRO campaign was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King’s reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”\n\nThe Kings said they “support transparency and historical accountability” but “object to any attacks on our father’s legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.”\n\nOpposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Right Act of 1964 and the Voting Right Act of 1965. After those landmark victories, King turned much of his attention to economic justice and international peace. He was an outspoken critic of rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King argued that political rights alone were not enough in an uneven economy. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat.\n\nKing was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice.\n\nRaypleaded guilty to assassinating King. He later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.\n\nKing family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno’s Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.”\n\nIn their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. had been the target of a conspiracy.\n\n“As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

A statement from his two living children condemned \"any attempts to misuse these documents in ways intended to undermine our father's legacy\".\n\nKing, the country's most famous civil rights activist, was shot in Memphis on 4 April 1968, at age 39. James Earl Ray, a career criminal, pleaded guilty to the killing, but later renounced his plea.\n\nTrump's critics noted the release comes as the administration is accused of a lack of transparency over files relating to influential sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose 2019 jail death was ruled a suicide.\n\nCivil rights leader Al Sharpton said the disclosure of the King files was \"a desperate attempt to distract\" from \"the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility\".\n\nKing Jr's two living children, Martin III and Bernice, who were notified ahead of time about the release, said in a statement on Monday: \"We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.\n\n\"The release of these files must be viewed within their full historical context.\n\n\"During our father's lifetime, he was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\"\n\nThe statement said the government's surveillance had denied King the \"dignity and freedoms of private citizens\".\n\nThe family also cited a jury verdict in a 1999 wrongful death civil lawsuit that found the civil rights leader was the victim not of a lone racist gunman, but of a vast conspiracy.\n\nIn January, Trump ordered that documents from the assassinations of King and former President John F Kennedy be declassified, along with the records in the assassination of Robert F Kennedy.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) said in a press release on Monday that the King files had \"sat collecting dust in facilities across the federal government for decades, until today\".\n\nThe documents include \"internal FBI memos\" and \"never-before-seen CIA records\" behind the hunt for King's assassin, the DNI said.\n\nThe release was co-ordinated with the FBI, Department of Justice, National Archives and CIA.\n\n\"The American people deserve answers decades after the horrific assassination of one of our nation's great leaders,\" US Attorney General Pamela Bondi said.\n\nBut experts  say the files contain little information beyond what is already known.\n\n\"There is nothing new or notable in what was released yesterday,\" David Garrow, a historian and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography on MLK Jr, told the BBC.\n\nMr Garrow added that many of the files contain details that have been in the public domain for over 40 years.\n\nNot all of King's family was upset about the release.\n\nReferring to the civil rights leader as \"my uncle\", Alveda King said: \"I am grateful to President Trump and DNI Gabbard for delivering on their pledge of transparency.\n\n\"While we continue to mourn his death, the declassification and release of these documents are a historic step towards the truth that the American people deserve.\"\n\nBefore his arrest, King's convicted assassin, James Earl Ray, fled the country to Canada, Portugal and the UK,where he raided a bank.\n\nExtradited to Memphis, he entered a guilty plea in 1969 and was sentenced to 99 years in prison.\n\nHe later claimed he had been framed by shadowy conspirators and tried to recant his guilty plea, but it was repeatedly upheld by the courts. Ray died in 1998 at 70.\n\nOn 14 August 2003, 22 years ago this week, the electricity cut out for more than 50 million people in the US and Canada.
