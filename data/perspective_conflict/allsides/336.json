    "question": "How might Trump’s portrayal of a Ukraine minerals deal as a de facto security backstop, his openness to the Chagos lease arrangement, and his tariff stance toward Europe with a possible carve‑out for the UK influence the next phase of US‑UK cooperation and European security planning?",

        "source_1": "Britain’s prime minister is potentially one of the European leaders best placed to handle the mercurial president\n\nKeir Starmer’s meeting withDonald Trumpthis week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador the US, has called this one of the “most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war”.\n\nCan the “special relationship” between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of “America first”? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises toraise defense spendingand negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?\n\nTrump is notoriously mercurial. His decisions are said to be influenced by the last person with whom he spoke. On Thursday, that person will be Starmer, who comes to the White House on the heels of France’sEmmanuel Macronto try his best to argue Europe’s case to the new US president.\n\nHere are six takeaways as Thursday’s meeting at the White House gets under way.\n\nTrump greeted Starmer amicably as the UK prime minister arrived at the White House, where the US president said that the two got along “famously” and called the US-UK relationship “tremendous”.\n\nIn an opening gambit, Starmer produceda letter from King Charles inviting Trump to visit the UK. “It’s an invitation for a second state visit. This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented,” Starmer said. Trump mused of Charles: “He’s a really great gentleman.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Starmer thanked Trump for making peace possible in Ukraine in a sign that the prime minister will limit his criticism of Trump’s sharp diplomatic turn away from Europe and the previous administration’s support for Ukraine.\n\n“Thank you for changing the conversation to bring about the possibility that now we can have a peace deal,” Starmer said. “And we want to work with you to make sure that peace deal is enduring, that it lasts, that it’s a deal that goes down to, historic deal that nobody reaches. And we’ll work with you to make sure that that absolutely happens.”\n\nTrump’s remarks following the meeting indicated that his views may have shifted ever-so-slightly on Ukraine following the meeting with Starmer. He did not repeat his statement that Zelenskyy was a “dictator”, said that he respected the Ukrainian leader, and added that Ukrainians had “fought very bravely ... somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave”.\n\nTrump also appeared to be shifting in his opening remarks when he said that his plan to sign a rare earth minerals deal with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday is “really going to get us into that country”. He indicated that the presence of American workers in Ukraine would provide a security guarantee for Ukraine because “we’ll be working there”.\n\n“We’ll have a lot of people working and so in that sense, it’s very good,” he said. “It’s a backstop. You could say, I don’t think anybody’s going to play around if we’re there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.”\n\nThat is not the kind of security guarantee that Ukrainian, French or British officials have envisioned as backing European peacekeepers in the country in the event that a ceasefire deal is reached. But it is the closest that Trump has come to saying that the US would engage in Ukraine’s security and provide a deterrent threat against Russia restarting the war if a ceasefire were signed.\n\nThere were positive signs for Starmer that Trump would not slap harsh tariffs on trade with the UK, as Trump praised his lobbying and said Starmer “earned whatever the hell they pay him over there”.\n\n“I think there’s a very good chance that, in the case of these two great friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn’t be necessary,” Trump said. “We’ll see.”\n\nTrump also offered Starmer an early win by saying that he would likely support a plan for the UK to cede control over the strategic Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius but then lease them back to maintain control over a strategic airbase used by the US and the UK.\n\nThe proposal to cede control over the archipelago had been mired in uncertainty after a general election led to a change of government in Mauritius and Starmer faced criticism at home for the deal to cede control over the series of atolls in the Indian Ocean that have been described as Britain’s last African colony. On the eve of the summit, David Lammy admitted that Trump had an effective veto over the deal, saying: “If President Trump doesn’t like the deal, the deal will not go forward.”\n\n“We’re going to have some discussions about that very soon, and I have a feeling it’s going to work out very well,” said Trump. “They’re talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years. Actually, that’s a long time, and I think we’ll be inclined to go along with your country. We have to be given the details, but it doesn’t sound bad.”\n\nThe key pledge that Starmer has made en route to Washington is to raise defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027, and then to 3% by 2035. He has called it the “biggest sustainedincrease in defense spendingsince the end of the cold war”.\n\nThat firm commitment is seen as the enticement to convince Trump to provide a “backstop” to a European security guarantee to Ukraine that would restrain Russia from breaking a potential ceasefire. “The security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin,” Starmer told reporters on his plane en route to Washington.\n\nBut in remarks at the British ambassador’s residence on Thursday, Starmer and his ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, also focused on the economic ties and opportunities for investment that exist between the UK and US. “We’re determined to help US innovators thrive in the United Kingdom so my message is we want to work with you, we want to welcome you to Britain, we want a new partnership because history shows that when we work together, great things happen,” Starmer said.\n\nUltimately, Starmer will need to convince Trump that support forUkraineandNatois a good deal, and he will argue his position as a win-win transaction rather than an obligation or duty to world security that previous leaders in the United States used to believe.\n\nStarmer followed Macron’s lead in his visit earlier this week by correcting Trump during his remarks to say that Europe had mainly gifted its financial support to Ukraine and had not given most of the aid in the form of loans.\n\n“We wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had,” Trump said of his decision to demand Ukraine pay back the US for it support. “They get their money back by giving money, we don’t get our money back.”\n\n“We’re not getting all of ours, quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given. There were some loans but mainly it was gifted actually,” Starmer said.\n\nStarmer trumpeted the “special relationship” between the United Kingdom and the US in defense and in business, but also directed some good-natured barbs at current administration officials, wryly commenting on the “buzz” in Washington these days and speaking about a new leader in Washington whom some love and others “love to hate”. (He joked that this was the new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, but the oblique reference to Trump was lost on few.)\n\n“We share the view that our best days lie ahead. And, you know, taking out a chainsaw isn’t quite my style,” said Starmer, clearly referring to Elon Musk, who has riled the British establishment by speaking out in favour of the far-right Reform UK party. “But we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy. We are reforming permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth. And we’re open for business.”\n\nLike Emmanuel Macron, Starmer needs to show the US president that he can stand up to him – and also show his constituency that he isn’t willing to sacrifice his values in order to make a deal.Macron walked that tightrope earlier this week, but it didn’t yield the main prize: the promise of a US backstop to European defense against Russia. Perhaps Starmer will have better luck with a concrete offer on defense spending.\n\nThe strains betweenVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Trump are evident, particularly as the US strong-arms the embattled leader into signing a rare earths mineral deal that Zelenskyy initially refused to endorse; in the ensuing days, Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections”.\n\nA report in French media on Thursday said that Trump even sought to cancel his meeting with Zelenskyy this week until Macron stepped in and convinced Trump to receive the Ukrainian leader at the White House on Friday. If true, that could be a crucial intervention to prevent a breakdown in talks between the US and Ukraine as the country’s fate hangs in the balance.\n\nOn Sunday, Starmer will host a meeting of European leaders that will include Zelenskyy. While the leader’s future appears uncertain, he may rely on European leaders such as Macron and Starmer to argue his side when his own relationship with Trump remains on shaky ground.",

He also claims that Zelensky wants to come back to the White House \"right now\" but that is not convenient for Trump.\n\nHe adds that a ceasefire could take place \"immediately\".\n\n\"We're not going to keep fighting, were going to get the war done or let them go and see what happens, let them fight it out,\" the president tells reporters.\n\nReporters have crushed onto the White House driveway to hear Trump's parting words before he boards a helicopter and heads for his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIt's hard to hear, but we're getting some lines on what he is saying.\n\nAs he describes the meeting with Zelensky - which he says \"did not turn out great\" - he repeats many of the same lines that we heard from the Oval Office.\n\nPrimarily, he says he wants to end the war soon. He says he wants peace and not a protracted war.\n\nHe adds that Zelensky \"overplayed his hand\" and \"wants to fight, fight, fight\".\n\nâThe prime minister has tonight spoken to both President Trump and President Zelensky.\n\nâHe retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine.\n\nâThe prime minister looks forward to hosting international leaders on Sunday including President Zelensky.â\n\nHere's a look at some of the latest Ukrainian reaction to the tense meeting in the White House.\n\nPolitical commentator Volodymyr Fesenko tells Ukrainian TV: âPresident Zelenskyâs nerves probably failed him. He should have been more restrained and flexible, especially reacting to JD Vance. And itâs best not to argue with Trumpâ.\n\nUkrainian journalist Illia Ponomarenko also weighs in: \"It's just shameful. They are shamelessly bending over backward to find anythingâanything at allâto pick at in Zelensky,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"And all of this is happening in front of the entire world, before the global press, live on air.They are trying everything on earth to break Zelensky\".\n\nOfficials in Ukraine have also responded. Maksym Kozytsky, head of regional administration in western Lviv region, writes: âIâve been watching the events in Washington closely.England had Richard the Lionheart, we have Volodymyr the Lionheart.â\n\nMyroslava Petsa and Daniel WittenbergBBC Ukrainian, in the Oval Office\n\nThe day began with the same cordial routine the White House reserves for visiting foreign dignitaries.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was welcomed by President Donald Trump at the door of the West Wing with an honour guard, and the leaders shook hands politely.\n\nWe were in the Oval Office as part of Ukrainian media pool, witnessing the well-rehearsed formalities.\n\nZelensky presented President Trump with the championship belt of Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk.\n\nBut minutes later, what erupted was unprecedented to say the least. The genial tone devolved into acrimony and chaos. Voices were raised, eyes-rolled, aspersions cast - and all in front of the world's TV cameras.\n\nJournalists in the room watched with gaping mouths, as extraordinary exchanges followed.\n\nAfterwards, our American colleagues remarked that they had never seen anything like it. \"A scene like this was simply unimaginable in the White House,\" one told me.\n\nContinue reading:What it was like in the room during the shouting match\n\nAfter being told by Donald Trump during their meeting earlier todayto \"be thankful\", Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have sent out countless messages of thanks to world leaders who have publicly reiterated their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe message: \"Thank you for your support\" has been posted by Zelensky on X at least 20 times in response posts from leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Poland's Donald Tusk and the Netherlands' Dick Schoof.\n\nIn an earlier message on X, Zelensky thanked his US counterpart - and Americans -several times over.\n\nThe relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky\nwas bad enough before the shouting match in the Oval Office. Now itâs in\npieces.\n\nThe public breakdown also signals a major crisis looming\nbetween European members of Nato and the US. Question marks about the US commitment to Europe are now redoubled.\n\nPresident Trump has put heavy pressure on Ukraine while\noffering big concessions to Russia.\n\nIt appears to be evidence that his priority is mending\nrelations with Russia â and concessions from Ukraine are a price heâs prepared\nto pay.\n\nIf Trump follows the breakdown of talks with a freeze on\nmilitary aid Ukraine will fight on. The doubts are how effectively, and for how\nlong.\n\nConversations Iâve had in Kyiv indicate that Ukraine is\nhoping that its European allies will take up the slack. There are also\nquestions about how much power Russia can deploy, having lost so many men and\nmachines.\n\nWe've already brought you commentsfrom Zelenskyandthe White Housein response to today's meeting, but other world leaders are now reacting too.\n\nA number of Ukraine's key European allies were quick to confirm their continued support for the country. French PresidentEmmanuel Macronsaid: \"Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people. I think we were all right to help Ukraine... and to continue to do so.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a post on X directed towards Zelensky, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyensaid: \"You are never alone dear president... we will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace\".\n\nTrump, howeverwas praisedby the deputy head of the Russian security council,Dmitry Medvedev, who said Zelensky \"finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office\".\n\nSimilarly, HungarianPrime MinisterViktor Orbansaid the US president \"stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest\".\n\nUS President Donald TrumpandUkrainian President\nVolodymyr Zelenskywere locked in a testy exchange in the Oval Office earlier\ntoday - which led to Zelensky being told to leave the White House.\n\nIt's a lot to take in, so we've rounded up the key points you may have missed.\n\nSome Russian officials are coming to Trump's defence following the meeting in the Oval Office earlier today.\n\nIn a post on X shortly after the exchange between Trump, Vance and Zelensky, Russian security council deputy headDmitry Medvedevwrote that Zelensky \"finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'\"\n\nDuring the confrontation, Trump made the same remark to Zelensky about the threat of a third World War.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham spoke outside the Oval Office a few moments ago - and it's clear his views on Zelensky have shifted.\n\nGraham, a formerly staunch defender of Ukraine, just told reporters that Zelensky needs to resign or someone else needs to take over negotiations.\n\nThe senator added that he did not believe Zelensky should have brought up ceasefires or security concerns ahead of the deal.\n\nHe's also called on Zelensky to \"apologise\" to Americans during his Fox News interview, which is expected later tonight.\n\nWatch: 'Complete, utter disaster' - Lindsey Graham reacts to Zelensky meeting\n\nThe spilling over we saw in the\nOval Office today reflected what's at stake for Zelensky and his\ncountry.\n\nThis is not\njust about minerals or money; it's about making sure three years of bloody\nfighting hasn't been for nothing. Itâs about the future existence of Ukraine in\nthe face of an existential war.\n\nShould\nhe have stayed calmer? Perhaps, but Ukraineâs leader wears this war, it is part\nof his political being. Clearly this mineral proposal was not as enticing for\nKyiv as Washington made out.\n\nUkrainians\nfeel any ceasefire - without a guarantee from the US that it would step in if\nwar reignited - would not be worth the paper it was written on.\n\nThe\nworrying signs were there when Zelensky folded his arms in a defensive way as\nhe came under an almost coordinated shouting assault from US president and\nvice-president.\n\nThat is a\nworrying symptom of a White House not really fixating on the realities of the\nwar and the cost Ukraine has paid, especially when Zelensky had to remind Trump\nof the year it started.\n\nSuch a visible deterioration\nbetween two allies has been a difficult and shocking sight here. Donald Trump\ncould yet come to Ukraineâs aid, or today could have been the moment he cut\nties with it, to Russiaâs delight.\n\nWe can now bring you more detail about the moments just after Zelensky and Trump's tense meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to our US partner CBS, the Ukrainian delegation left the Oval Office to a \"separated room\".\n\nThere, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave the White House.\n\nAs we reported earlier, a scheduled press conference with Zelensky and Trump wascancelled shortlyafter the Oval Office meeting. We also watched live as the Ukrainian president exited the White House into a waiting vehicle.\n\nThe White House says Trump and Vice-President JD Vance \"will never allow the American people to be taken advantage of\".\n\nIn a statement released shortly after their meeting with Zelensky, the White House says the pair \"will always stand up for the interests of the American people and those who respect the United Statesâ position in the world\".\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha says Volodymyr Zelensky \"has the bravery and strength to stand up for what is right,\" in a post on X, following the president's early departure from the White House.\n\n\"He stands up for Ukraine and the goal of a just and lasting peace,\" Sybiha continues, adding that Ukraine has \"always been and will continue to be grateful to America for its support\".\n\nWe're now seeing photos of the podiums and tables that were set up for the anticipated news conference and deal-signing ceremony between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe event in the East Room of the White House was abruptly cancelled after the explosive exchange between the two leaders.\n\nIn his first comments after meeting with Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanks his US counterpart - and Americans - several times over.\n\n(For context:Trump earlier told Zelensky he should be \"thankful\" for US support, while Vice-President JD Vance accused him of not saying thank you during the meeting.)\n\n\"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.\"\n\n\"Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. \nUkraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\n\nThough some Republican lawmakers have criticised Trump and Vance for their confrontation with Zelensky, other allies are rushing to their defence.\n\nRepresentativeRick Scottof Florida writes on X: \"Thank you President Trump for standing up for America\".\n\nSenate foreign relations memberMike Leerepeats Scott's remarks and also thanks the two for \"putting America first\".\n\nFar-right representativeMarjorie Taylor-Greenesays: \"Putting Zelensky in his place while he disrespects the U.S. in the Oval Office is exactly what American leadership should look like.\"\n\nJust as the rest of us digest the astonishing exchanges\nin the White House, so do people in government.\n\nJaws are dropping there just as they are elsewhere.\n\nJust 24 hours ago, I stood in the Oval Office as the prime\nminister exchanged warm words with President Trump.\n\nThe atmosphere tonight couldnât have been more different.\n\nThe summit on Sunday, hosted by the prime minister, takes\non an even greater significance, as Europe collectively tries to work out how\nit responds to the very public breakdown in the relationship between Washington\nand Kyiv.\n\nEuropean leaders are just now beginning to respond to the tense exchange between Trump, Vance and Zelensky.\n\nIn a post on X, Polish Prime Minister and former president of the European CouncilDonald Tuskaddressed Zelensky and said \"dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone\".\n\nAsked about the confrontation while in Portugal, French PresidentEmmanuel Macrontells French media that Russia is the aggressor and the Ukrainian people are those one being attacked.\n\nHe adds that European countries and other allies were right to help Ukraine three years ago and to sanction Russia and to continue to do so.\n\nHe adds that it's important to \"respect\" those who have been fighting since the start for their dignity, rights and the security of Europe.",

Sir Keir interjected that the US had a slightly positive trade balance with Britain.\n\nAnd he suggested he would support theChagos dealwith Mauritius, in an apparent win for the PM.\n\nSir Keir said the UK and US had the 'closest relationship of any two countries when it comes to prosperity and security'.\n\nBut the PM is facing a diplomatic high-wire act as he appeals for Mr Trump to stop VladimirPutin'coming again' after a rushedUkrainepeace deal, arguing America must help guarantee the terms.\n\nMr Trump claimed not to remember that he had described VolodymyrZelenskyas a 'dictator', acknowledging that things had got 'testy' despite their good relationship.\n\nAt one point he insisted that Kyiv joining Nato is 'not going to happen', echoing a Russian talking point by claiming that Joe Biden raising the prospect was what 'started this whole thing'.\n\nIn one flicker of tensions, vice presidentJD Vanceswiped at 'infringements on free speech' in the UK while answering a question.\n\nSir Keir shot back: 'We have had free speech for a very long time in the UK.

I shall happily take that back to His Majesty.'\n\nAsked if he could be persuaded to provide a backstop security position as part of a Ukraine peace settlement, Mr Trump said: 'President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday, Friday morning, and we're going to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides, because it's really going to get us into that country.'\n\nHe added: 'It's a backstop, you could say, I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.\n\n'We appreciate it very much and I look forward to seeing him. We'll be talking about it and we'll also be talking about that today with the Prime Minister.'\n\nReminded of his comment about Mr Zelensky being a 'dictator', Mr Trump said: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question, please go ahead.'\n\nThe US President said he was able to 'get along with both' Mr Zelensky and Putin.\n\nHe added: 'I have a very good relationship with President Putin. I think I have a very good relationship with President Zelensky.'\n\nHe said: 'It maybe got a little bit testy because we wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had. You know, they they get their money back by giving money, we don't get the money back. Biden made a deal. He put in 350 billion dollars and I thought it was a very unfair situation.'\n\nSir Keir intervened to say: 'We're not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. It was given. There were some loans, but mainly it was gifted actually.'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron corrected Mr Trump on the same point during his visit to Washington earlier this week.\n\nMr Trump said he would 'always be with the British' if they needed help. 'You know, I've always found about the British – they don't need much help,' he said.\n\n'It sounds like it's evasive but it's not evasive. You know, the British have been incredible soldiers, incredible military, and they can take care of themselves.\n\n'But if they need help, I'll always be with the British, OK? I'll always be with them – but they don't need help.'\n\nMr Trump seemed to contradict himself later when Sir Keir was talking about how the US and UK had always 'absolutely backed each other up'.\n\n'Could you take on Russia by yourselves?' Mr Trump said.\n\nGrilled on threats of 'beautiful' tariffs of up to 25 per cent on imports to the US, Mr Trump said he would need to 'take a look' at the UK's arrangements.\n\nMr Trump said: 'I can say that … we're here for a different reason – we're talking about a very different place.\n\n'I have investments there, I own Turnberry, I own Aberdeen, and I own a great place called Doonbeg in Ireland.\n\nSir Keir Starmer then said: 'And our trade, obviously, is fair and balanced and, in fact, you've got a bit of surplus.\n\n'So, we're in a different position there – and obviously we contributed hugely in relation to Ukraine.'\n\nAsked if there will not be any sanctions on the UK, Mr Trump said: 'Well, I have to take a look.'\n\nOn the deal to hand the British territory of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, and pay to lease back the UK-US Diego Garcia military base - which has been causing increasing alarm in the UK - Mr Trump seemed ready to support it.\n\n'We're going to have some discussions about that very soon and I have a feeling it's going to work out very well,' he said.\n\n'They're talking about a very long-term, powerful lease, a very strong lease, about 140 years, actually. It's a long time.\n\n'I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country.'\n\nHe added: 'It's a little bit early, we have to yet be given the details, but it doesn't sound bad.'\n\nMr Trump singled out Sir Keir's wife Victoria during the on-camera chat, saying he was 'very impressed'.\n\n'I think we have just a great relationship. We actually had a good relationship before. We've met a couple of times and I'm very impressed with him, and very impressed with his wife,' he said.\n\nMr Trump continued: 'And I said, 'you're very lucky'. He's very lucky. And, no, we've had a very good relationship.'\n\nChallenged if the UK would jeopardise its relationship with the US by seeking closer ties with the EU, Mr Trump said: 'No, I don't worry about that.'\n\nThe premier was given a boost before the encounter as US officials praised the UK's commitment to hike spending on defence to 2.5 per cent of GDP, and the offer of troops for any Ukraine settlement.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said this afternoon: 'We're very pleased with Prime Minister Starmer's announcement to increase spending to 2.5 per cent of the UK is GDP.\n\n'President Trump does continue to urge ourNATOallies to increase their spending even further toward 5 per cent to address years of underfunding in the defense capabilities of NATO.\n\n'We appreciate President Starmer's leadership, also in his recent discussions committing British troops to help enforce peace once a deal is reached.'\n\nHowever, eagle-eyed observers also noted that the Union Flag was being flown upside down at the Blair House residence where Sir Keir has been staying as a guest of the US - traditionally a distress signal.\n\nMr Trump has insisted 25 per cent tariffs will be imposed on the EU, which he has said was formed to 'screw' the US.\n\nBritain is currently facing tariffs on steel exports, and the threat of 'reciprocal' tariffs to offsetVAT- even though that is a general sales tax rather than a charge on imports.\n\nSpeaking to reporters en route to Washington last night, Sir Keir confirmed he is ready to send thousands of British troops to keep the peace in Ukraine if Mr Trump secures a truce in the three-year-old war.\n\nA fawning Sir Keir handed Mr Trump the invite for a state visit saying it was 'historic'\n\nSir Keir was walking a diplomatic tightrope in his exchanges with the president\n\nSir Keir posted on social media about his discussions with Mr Trump\n\nBut he warned it would be an impossible mission unless the United States provides a military 'backstop' to British and European forces.\n\nThe PM said Putin would inevitably 'come again' unless the West is united in securing Ukraine's future - potentially plunging the continent into war.\n\n'The reason I say the backstop is so important is that the security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again,' he said.\n\n'My concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.'\n\nHe added: 'I'm considering how we preserve peace in Europe and how we get a lasting peace in Ukraine.'\n\n'And I'm absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen we need security guarantees.\n\n'Precisely what that layers up to, what that looks like, is obviously a subject of intense discussion.\n\n'We will play our part and I've been clear that we will need a US backstop of some sort.'\n\nThe PM's visit to the White House today is part of a frantic European effort to persuade President Trump not to abandon Ukraine and Europe.\n\nThe diplomatic push began with a visit by Emmanuel Macron to the White House on Monday and will continue when President Volodymyr Zelensky visits Washington tomorrow to discuss what security guarantees the US is prepared to offer in return for a share of valuable rare minerals.\n\nAll three leaders are expected to review progress at an emergency summit on European security in London on Sunday.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said the proposed deal on rare minerals 'may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?'\n\nThe PM faces a diplomatic tightrope as he tries to avoid antagonising a President whose claim that President Zelensky is a 'dictator' and recent statements on issues like Nato and Gaza have horrified and alarmed senior ministers.\n\nSir Keir with the new ambassador to the US Lord Mandelson at the UK embassy earlier today\n\nSir Keir has been appealing for Mr Trump to stop Vladimir Putin (pictured) 'coming again' after a rushed peace deal, arguing America must help guarantee the terms\n\nThe diplomatic push began with a visit by Emmanuel Macron to the White House on Monday and will continue when President Volodymyr Zelensky (pictured right in Dublin today) visits Washington tomorrow\n\nYesterday Sir Keir pointedly referred to President Zelensky as Ukraine's 'democratically elected' leader.\n\nAnd Downing Street said he would push Mr Trump to agree that Ukraine's leader must be involved in any peace talks on the future of his country.\n\nBut government sources acknowledged he is anxious to avoid a public row with the President, whose return to the White House last month has upended the post-war world order.\n\nAt a reception attended by Sir Keir last night, new ambassador to the US Lord Mandelson praised Mr Trump as a 'very consequential president'.\n\nThe peer said it was a 'very significant moment for our lives, between our two countries and indeed for all the freedom-loving democracies in the world'.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy has admitted there will be 'no deal' on handing over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius - and then paying to lease back the military base on Diego Garcia - unless Mr Trump agrees.\n\nAhead of Sir Keir's talks with Mr Trump, a Cabinet minister suggested the PM would not be 'fact-checking'.\n\nIn an apparent swipe at Mr Macron - who attempted to correct Mr Trump on Ukraine funding during his own visit to Washington DC this week - Environment Secretary Steve Reed said Sir Keir did not need to be 'performative'.\n\nHe told reporters during a Westminster lunch event: 'I don't think it is for the Prime Minister on any visit to be fact-checking, as you put it, his host - wherever that might be.\n\n'It's for the British Prime Minister to advocate for the interests of the UK in a way that is most likely to secure the outcomes that we want. That is the approach the Prime Minister will be taking.\n\n'It's not performative, it's extremely serious about getting the outcomes we need, whether that would be on trade, on security, or on any other issues that might come up during those kinds of meetings.'\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article."
