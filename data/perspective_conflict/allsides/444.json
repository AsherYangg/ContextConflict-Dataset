        "source_1": "President Joe Biden’s pardon ofHunter Bidenended the nearly decade-long prosecution of his only surviving son and immediately provoked the expected storm of criticism. The criticism, whether from Republicans or Democrats is unjustified. As pardons go, this one was well within norms, righteous, and gives us a glimpse of how this ultimate exercise of executive power can potentially be used to heal and even protect.\n\nThe Presidential pardon powersmacksof Kings and rulers, not democratic leaders. English history dates pardons back to King Ine of Wessex in the 7th Century.\n\nCommon sense informs that it dates back to the first “leader” wielding the biggest club. Contrary to Alexander Hamilton’s surprisingly naïveviewthat giving the President sole power was preferable because “a single person would be “a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of the government than a body of men,” there is no legitimate reason to give so much discretion to the executive with no accountability.\n\nRecent efforts to lessen the Kingly stench of pardons with a the perfume of objective process have included creating an Office of the Pardon Attorney within the Department of Justice (OPA) with an application process.\n\nThe OPA has traditionally done extensive due diligence on such applications before making recommendations to the Attorney General who in turn presents these to the President. The OPA process was abandoned altogether during the firstTrumppresidency as Trump depended more on social media influencers likeKim Kardashianfor his vetting process on pardons or simply pardoned family likeCharles Kushner—Jared’s dad—who is now nominated to be the next ambassador to France.\n\nBut Trump was hardly an outlier here. President Clinton pardoned his ownbrotherRoger, as well as giving an infamous midnight hour pardon to financierMarc Rich. Jimmy Carter pardoned his brother, and President Lincolnpardonedhis sister-in-law.\n\nHunter Bidenfalls well within in the norms for familial pardons. His crimes were modest, consisting of tax evasion for which he paid back the taxes and buying a gun while addicted to cocaine—a gun he never used in any crime and only owned for 11-days. Indeed, a pretty much unanimous universe of legal experts agree that criminal prosecution for these crimes is extremely rare and likely due to the fact that Hunter’s father was President of the United States.\n\nWhat makes his pardon unusual is how President Biden consistently claimed he would not grant one as well as the unusual specificity that Biden made public for why hechangedhis mind.\n\nCriticism from Republicanshasbeen immediate and predictably hyperbolically wrong. Rep. James Comer: “Not only has he [President Biden] falsely claimed that he never met with his son’s foreign business associates and that his son did nothing wrong, but he also lied when he said he would not pardon Hunter Biden…[t]he charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people.”\n\nHolding aside the comical equating of supposed lying about enormous political corruption with lying about intentions to pardon a relative, Comer continues to misunderstand that Hunter Biden was neither charged nor convicted of corruption and no evidence of it exists.\n\nCriticismfrom Democrats also misses the mark, conflating as they do President Biden’s concern for his son with whether the pardon power was properly used. Colorado Governor Polis said: “This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation” and “Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) said on X: “I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically-motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers.”\n\nSuch comments reflect woeful ignorance of the pardon power. There is no such thing as “precedent” for the pardon power—it can be used any way a President feels. Nor is disagreement over whether the prosecution was politically motivated relevant because no such requirement exists either.\n\nBut the fact that President Biden made plain his belief that the prosecution was politically motivated is deeply significant. Rarely are the factors underlying a pardon so fully public. Even under the OPA system much of the basis for a recommendation of clemency remain confidential in a way reminiscent of pre-sentence reports prepared for a judge. The critics can say what they want but the reasons for Hunter being pardoned are now memorialized. The pardon itself is impossible to circumvent as the time period covers the last ten years—making any older potential charges time-barred.\n\nThe reasons are righteous. This was a prosecution born under the political pressure of Trump’s political henchman Bill Barr and then allowed to continue under Merrick Garland’s passivity—it would have died a natural death with a plea bargain that faltered in court but could have been revived but for Republican political pressure.\n\nThat political heat seemingly caused Garland to elevate Weiss to Special Counsel status, giving Weiss a proverbialiron rice bowlof job security. If Garland lacked the will to end it then it was proper for his boss to do so.\n\nPresident Biden can’t spare us from the consequences of a second Trump term with the same ease. But, as suggested by former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean, there is more good Biden can do with the pardon power before he leaves. He could pardon all of the targets of the Trump regime like Special Counsel Jack Smith, Liz Cheney, and all those threatened by Trump’s vengeance.\n\nDean thensuggestsBiden could pardon Trump. President Gerald Ford pardoned Dean’s old boss in an effort to end a national nightmare. It didn’t. But Dean’s suggestion to Biden might come much closer to accomplishing that goal. I might add to Dean’s suggestion that Biden pardon the many enablers of Trump’s schemes, including the members of Congress that Garland’s DOJ never charged and maybe even Trump’s chief-of-staff—new and old.\n\nThe chances in the future of any these being charged is now near zero so little would be lost. But much could be gained by illuminating more clearly those who deserve the protection of pardons, and those who should have needed them.",

Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresidentJoe Biden's decision to pardon his son,Hunter Biden, less than two weeks before his sentencing was, in my view, the right thing to do. It was an act of compassion and a practical solution to a legal case that had become hopelessly entangled in partisan politics.\n\nBut while the pardon itself may have been justified, the president's repeated and unequivocal denials that he would ever consider such a move were deeply damaging. It was obvious to anyone following the situation closely that he would eventually issue the pardon. By refusing to admit the possibility beforehand, Biden contributed to the pervasive erosion of trust in politics and politicians.\n\nLet's first address why the pardon was the right decision. Hunter Biden's legal troubles, while serious, were not particularly extraordinary in the grand scheme of federal prosecutions. He faced charges of failing to pay taxes on time and illegally owning a firearm while struggling with addiction. While these offenses are not trivial, they hardly make him the criminal mastermindRepublicanshave portrayed him to be.\n\nWhat set Hunter's case apart was not the nature of his crimes but the context in which they unfolded. The president's son has long been a lightning rod for partisan attacks, used as a stand-in for every baseless accusation of corruption or impropriety hurled at Joe Biden. Under such circumstances, it understandable why so many loud voices argued that the Hunter Biden proceedings were less about his actions and more about the political theater surrounding them.\n\nThere is also a historical and moral precedent for such an act of clemency. Presidents have often used pardons to temper justice with mercy, even in politically fraught circumstances. GeraldFord's pardon of Richard Nixon, though controversial at the time, is now widely seen as a necessary step to help the country move past the Watergate scandal. More recently,Barack Obamacommuted the sentences of nonviolent drug offenders to rectify systemic injustices in the criminal justice system. In this context, Biden's pardon of his son can be viewed as a similarly humane and pragmatic decision.\n\nBut the decision to pardon Hunter was not purely altruistic; it was also politically astute. One of the less-discussed dynamics of this situation is the omnipresent specter of the next president—Donald Trump.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine a scenario in which Trump, returning to the presidency, could have seized on the case to embarrass the Biden family further. Imagine how much worse it would have looked if Trump had pardoned Hunter himself—gleefully painting Joe Biden as too weak or too politically impotent to protect his own son. Such a spectacle would have been far more damaging to the presidency than Biden's decision to issue the pardon himself. In some ways, Biden acted preemptively, not just to spare his son but also to avoid handing Trump yet another political cudgel.\n\nAnd yet, Biden's handling of the matter was far from perfect. For months, the president publicly and unequivocally insisted that he would never pardon his son. \"Hunter will be treated like any other citizen,\" he said repeatedly, as if this declaration alone could insulate him from criticism.\n\nAs I wrote before, these denials were, at best, implausible. From the moment charges were brought against Hunter, it was clear that his case presented a unique challenge to the president—one that would force him to weigh his responsibilities as a father against his duties as commander-in-chief. That Biden would ultimately choose to pardon his son should not have surprised anyone paying attention.\n\nThis pattern of denial is emblematic of a larger problem in American politics: the pervasive belief among politicians that they cannot afford to be honest with the public. Biden's repeated denials did not shield him from criticism; they only made his eventual decision appear calculated and cynical. Had he been upfront—acknowledging the extraordinary circumstances of his son's case and the difficult choices it posed—he might have turned the pardon into a moment of candor and humanity. Instead, his denials gave the impression of a leader trying to have it both ways: insisting on impartiality while preparing to act out of loyalty.\n\nThis kind of dishonesty is not unique to Biden, of course. Politicians across the ideological spectrum seem to operate on the assumption that the public cannot handle the truth. They spin, evade, and obfuscate, convinced that transparency will only make them more vulnerable.\n\nBut in doing so, they have profoundly deepened the public's cynicism and eroded trust in the institutions they are supposed to uphold. Americans are not naive. They can see through the spin, and they are tired of being treated like gullible bystanders in a political drama where the outcomes are all but predetermined.\n\nBiden's handling of Hunter's case underscores the steep cost of this dishonesty. When leaders consistently deny what is plainly true—whether it's about pardoning a family member or addressing larger issues like climate change or economic inequality—they reinforce the perception that politics is little more than a game of manipulation.\n\nThis disillusionment has far-reaching consequences. It drives voters toward populists and demagogues who promise to \"tell it like it is,\" even when their words are laced with lies. It fosters apathy, leaving many citizens disengaged and disenchanted. And it undermines democracy itself, which depends on a basic level of trust between leaders and the people they serve.\n\nWhat the country needs now, more than ever, is leaders who are willing to level with the public—even when the truth is complicated or politically inconvenient. Americans don't expect their politicians to be perfect, but they should be able to expect them to be honest. By failing to meet that standard, Biden missed a chance to build trust at a time when trust is in desperately short supply. His pardon of Hunter was an act of mercy, but his handling of it was a reminder of just how far our politics still has to go.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize-nominated writer, Aron Solomon, JD, is the chief strategy officer forAmplify.

        "source_3": "We always knew Joe Biden would pardon his troubled son Hunter, no matter how many times he promised he wouldn’t.\n\nSo it is fitting that one of the final acts of this mendacious president before leaving office was to break yet another promise to the American people.\n\nThus on Sunday night, the president issued a statement from the White House declaring that he had just signed a “Full and Unconditional Pardon”for Robert Hunter Biden, 54.\n\nThe pardon Joe vowed he would never give comes just days before Hunter was due to be sentenced over a felony gun conviction in Delaware in June and California felony tax fraud charges in September to which he pleaded guilty on the first day of trial.\n\nJoe claims that Hunter was “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently … singled out only because he is my son.”\n\nIn an amusing twist, the president explained away all his lies to the American people by lying about his lying: “For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth.”\n\nJoe told reporters in June after Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges in Delaware that he definitelywould not pardon his son.\n\n“I said I abide by the jury decision,” he said at the G7 summit in Italy. “I will do that. And I will not pardon him.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked, “Do you plan on commuting your son’s sentence?,” Joe, 82, said, “No.”\n\nWith a truthful president, that would be the end of it, but with the fabulist, plagiarist Pinocchio currently in that job, it meant little.\n\nThe same for the repeated assurances of the perennial know-nothing Karine Jean-Pierre from the White House podium that no pardon would be forthcoming.\n\nNo wonder Hunterlooked so smug over the weekendwhen he was photographed out and about in Nantucket with his dad and the rest of the Biden clan.\n\nFor a guy facing two prison sentences, he was chewing gum and acting like he didn’t have a care in the world.\n\nHours after Joe and Hunter dined at a Nantucket restaurant named, appropriately enough, the Brotherhood of Thieves, the Washington Post published excerpts Saturday from a document written by the first son’s lawyers that made the emotional case for his pardon.\n\nSince his father was the only person on the planet with the power to pardon Hunter, at least until his presidency ends on Jan. 20, the 52-page paper would seem to have been written for an audience of one — the Oval Office guy vacationing with his family on Nantucket.\n\nBut why would Hunter and his lawyers feel the need to leak the heartstrings-tugging document when he was right there with his dad every day, hanging out in the borrowed mansion of private equity billionaire David Rubenstein, poking around in bookstores buying anti-Israeli books and watching the town Christmas tree lighting?\n\nClearly the document was a carefully crafted excuse created to help Joe fool the American people into believing that Hunter was a victim of political persecution, who suffered due to his father’s power and influence.\n\nIf you read the excerpts of his lawyers’ mournful missive, titled “The political prosecutions of Hunter Biden,” you would see echoes in Joe’s Sunday night statement. You would see that they hold grave fears for Hunter’s future now that thedreaded Donald Trump is taking power.\n\n“With the election now decided, the threat against Hunter is real,” the lawyers wrote.\n\n“There is no disputing that Trump has said his enemies list includes Hunter … The prospect that Trump will turn his vengeance on the Special Counsel prosecutors if they fail to take a harder line against Hunter no doubt exerts considerable pressure on them.”\n\nHunter’s pricey lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell, described the opus in dramatic terms as “the complete and reprehensible history of the political persecution of Hunter Biden … a seven-year saga propelled by an unrelenting political desire to use a son to hurt his father.”\n\nIt is “a wild and terrifying story … a stark warning of what is to come as some of the same Republicans who targeted Hunter prepare to resume power and have stated their intention to use the government’s vast power to pursue their perceived enemies.”\n\nHunter knowingly committed the crimes for which he has been pardoned and he did so in the arrogant belief that his father’s power made him untouchable.\n\nAnd despite Lowell’s excuse that Hunter was “in the throes of serious drug addiction,” Hunter was sober at the time he committed the tax fraud, according to his own timeline he presented in court.\n\nHunter’s father and lawyers have spun a fictional narrative expecting that most people won’t know the whole story.\n\nThe truth is that Hunter’s legal team bullied the DOJ into not charging Hunter and did so by invoking Joe’s name.\n\nThey would have succeeded if not for IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joe Ziegler, who told Congress the truth about the years-long political obstruction of their investigation to favor Hunter and hide Joe’s involvement in the family influence-peddling schemes.\n\n“We haven’t seen this ‘report’ yet, but Hunter Biden’s legal team has consistently gone to extremes to attack us for doing our duty as career law enforcement agents,” Shapley and Ziegler said Saturday.\n\n“No amount of lies or spin can hide the simple truth that the Justice Department nearly let the President’s son off the hook for multiple felonies.\n\n“We did our duty, told the truth, and followed the law. Anyone reading his lawyers’ excuses now should remember that Mr. Biden admitted to his tax crimes in federal court, that his attorneys are targeting us for our lawful whistleblower disclosures, and that we are suing one of those attorneys for smearing us with false accusations.”\n\nSign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine\n\nBy clicking above you agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\n\nThe Bidens are correct when they say that the legal system was “corrupted by political leaders in this country,” or as Joe puts it, “that raw politics has infected this process” — but not in the way they pretend.\n\nHunter got an unfair advantage because of his father’s power. He broke laws with impunity and knew that nobody would ever stop him from doing exactly what he wanted. Every time he slipped up, his father and his minions in the FBI, DOJ, IRS, State Department and CIA intervened to get him off the hook.\n\nThe corrupted investigation in Delaware was just the tip of the iceberg. Hunter didn’t even have to worry about legal fees and living expenses to support his lavish lifestyle. Daddy’s donors always came through.\n\nThe person who corrupted the legal system in this country is Joe Biden. He weaponized it against his political nemesis Donald Trump, and Trump’s supporters. Trump is the victim of unjust prosecution, not Hunter.\n\nBut the American people understand that, as they proved on Election Day when they elected Trump in a landslide, despite the lawfare.\n\nThat’s why the news of Hunter’s pardon is the least surprising news of the decade. Nobody believes the word of a Biden."
