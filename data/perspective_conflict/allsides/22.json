(AP) — A city councilman in Virginia was seriously injured Wednesday when a man stormed into his office at a local magazine, doused him in gasoline and set him on fire — an attack that authorities say was rooted in a personal dispute, not politics.\n\nLee Vogler, 38, who has served on the Danville City Council for more than a decade, was taken by medical helicopter to a burn unit in North Carolina after the attack. Police said the assailant, 29-year-old Shotsie Michael Buck Hayes, forced his way into Vogler’s office at Showcase Magazine, confronted him, then chased him outside and set him ablaze.\n\nHayes was arrested at the scene on charges of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated malicious wounding.\n\nInvestigators stressed that the motive appeared personal and unrelated to Vogler’s work as a public official. Still, the assault added to growing unease overviolence and harassment aimed at elected officialsacross the country, particularly as the boundaries blur between their public roles and private lives.\n\n“There is no justification for lashing out,” said Andrew Scott Brooks, publisher of the magazine. “This type of act of senseless violence needs to stop.”\n\nTwo employees were in the building when the attack occurred, Brooks said. According to police and witnesses, Vogler ran through the office yelling for help after being doused in gasoline. A colleague called for help as Hayes chased Vogler outside and ignited the fire, the publisher said.\n\n▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.\n\n“Our door is locked,” Brooks said. “They forced their way into the office, and went to Lee. The next thing, Lee is running through the office covered in gasoline, yelling for our officemate to call 911.”\n\nHayes was being held without bond in the Danville City Jail, police said. A message left with a phone number listed for the suspect wasn’t immediately returned. A message was left with the Danville Public Defender Office asking whether they will be representing the suspect.\n\nShowcase Magazine is a monthly publication about southwest Virginia and North Carolina. The magazine shares a small two-story building with several other businesses in Danville.\n\nA woman who answered the door at the Vogler residence and identified herself as the sister of Vogler’s wife declined to comment. A man at an address listed for Hayes also declined comment.\n\nElected officials and politicians throughout Virginia quickly condemned the attack.\n\n“Our prayers go out to Danville City Councilman Lee Vogler who was violently attacked at his workplace earlier today,”Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkinsaid in a statement. “We pray for a swift recovery for Lee and for peace to be on the entire Danville community.”\n\nBrooks said he had no indication that Vogler felt unsafe at work or elsewhere. Vogler is a salesperson at the magazine, though at the small-city media company, everyone does a bit a bit of everything.\n\n“He makes sales, but he also writes stories about our community,” Brooks said.\n\n“His passion is being on the city council,” Brooks said. “He loves when people call them with a concern that he can help them with, and he has been an asset to the community for much of his adult life. He was young when he got on city council, early 20s. He has made that his life.”\n\nBrooks said outside of work, Vogler is dedicated parent to his two kids.\n\n“He’s the one who coaches their sports teams,” Brooks said.\n\nDanville is about 140 miles (227 kilometers) north of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nDiaz reported from Richmond, Virginia.

        "source_3": "A city councilman in Virginia was savagely set on fire by a lunatic who stormed into his workplace carrying gallons of fuel and ignited the lawmaker Wednesday morning in the latest sickening attack against an American elected official.\n\nDanville City Councilman Lee Vogler was allegedly set on fire after Shotsie Michael Buck Hayes, 29, barged into Showcase Magazine, a local monthly publication, and dumped a five-gallon bucket of gasoline on the pol around 11:30 a.m., according to the Danville Police Department and the outlet’s publisher, Andrew Brooks.\n\nVogler, a 38-year-old married father of two, managed to escape the office and ran to the front of the building, but the monster followed him and torched him.\n\n“This type of senseless act of violence has to stop,” Brookssaid in an emotional video published on Facebook Wednesday morning, where he described the horrifying moment Hayes “forced his way” into their offices and drenched the councilman with the fire accelerant.\n\n“You do not have the right as a human being to get upset with someone enough to lash out and attempt to harm them in any way, much less this way.”\n\nFirst responders rendered aid to the pol, who identified his suspected attacker at the harrowing scene, before he was airlifted to a hospital in North Carolina.\n\nThe extent of Vogler’s injuries is unknown, but Brooks noted he was awake and talking following the terrifying incident and was being taken to a burn center in Lynchburg.\n\n“Urgent prayers are needed for my son Lee Vogler,” his devastated mom, Rhonda,wrote on Facebook, mere hours afterhonoring the 8th anniversaryof her own mother’s death.\n\n“I believe in the power of prayer. I told Lee God’s got him and we’re praying for him. I appreciate all of you and your prayers.”\n\nHayes, a Danville resident, initially fled the horrific scene and was captured in his vehicle several blocks from where he allegedly lit the local politician ablaze, according to police.\n\nAuthorities said Vogler and Hayes are known to each other, but added the attack stems from a personal matter that is not related to the councilman’s elected position or political affiliation.\n\nThe deranged arsonist has been charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated malicious wounding,police said.\n\nHe is being held without bond at the Danville City Jail.\n\n“Our prayers go out to Danville City Councilman Lee Vogler who was violently attacked at his workplace earlier today,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkinposted on X.\n\n“We pray for a swift recovery Lee and for peace to be on the entire Danville community.”\n\nDanville Mayor Alonzo Jones thanked first responders for their swift action but noted that city officials are “hurting” in the wake of Vogler’s vicious attack.\n\n“Lee is a member of our City Council family. And today, that family is hurting,” Jonessaid in a statement.\n\n“Our Council is close. We’ve worked through challenges together – and now, we face this heartbreak together. Please continue to pray for Lee and his family. We’re standing with him – and with each other.”\n\nVogler was elected to the Danville City Council in May 2012, becoming the youngest person ever elected to that position at the age of 24,according to his bio.\n\nThe four-term councilman graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and is the managing partner for Andrew Brooks Media Group.\n\nThe Danville native also serves on the Virginia Small Business Commission, a position Youngkin appointed him to in July 2022, accordingto his Linkedin, and is a member of the Virginia Young Republicans.\n\n“The Young Republican Federation of Virginia is shocked and deeply saddened by the brutal attack on our friend, fellow young Republican, and dedicated public servant, Councilman Lee Vogler,”  the conservative organizationsaid in a statement.\n\n“Lee has been a tireless advocate for his city and for the Commonwealth, and we know the strength of his spirit will carry him through this difficult time. Political differences or personal grievances should never escalate to violence. We condemn this heinous act in the strongest possible terms and call for swift justice.”\n\nVogler, who is deeply committed to Danville’s youth, also attends Compassion Church with his wife, Blair, and his two kids, Kingston and Ava,according to his re-election site, which states he campaigned last year on lowering taxes, supporting small business and better pay for police, firefighters and first responders.\n\nWednesday’s attack is the latest in a disturbing wave of violence targeting elected officials, including President Trump,who narrowly escaped deathwhen a would-be assassin fired at him during a 2024 campaign rally in Butler, Pa. The then-candidate was struck in the ear before the 20-year-old gunman was taken out by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nLast month, former Minnesota Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark and beloved family dog, Gilbert,were gunned down and killedin their Minneapolis home in a twisted, politically motivated attack. Alleged assassin, Vance Boelter, is also accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who both survived.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’shome was firebombed overnight during Passover in Aprilby a deranged attacker allegedly motivated by antisemitism while the Jewish lawmaker and his family slept.\n\nDemocratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wasalso the victim of a domestic terror schemeaimed at abducting the lawmaker and overthrowing the state government in 2020."
