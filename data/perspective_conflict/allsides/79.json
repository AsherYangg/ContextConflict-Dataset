        "source_1": "The 'Big, Beautiful Bill' is massively unpopular, Trump debates deporting Musk, July 4 protests, and more\n\nAfter several hours of deliberation,the Senate narrowly passedPresident Donald Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill on Tuesday, sending it back to the House. The outcome was the exact opposite of what Elon Musk, Trump’s one-time ally and the country’s biggest Republican donor, had hoped for. Ahead of the vote, Musk continued his long-time opposition to the bill, and vowed to create a new rival political party, titled the America Party, should the Republicans pass it.\n\n“If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uni-party, so that the people actually have a voice,”Musk said via his social media platform, X, on Monday evening.\n\nThe former lead of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), who had a big falling out with Trump after leaving the position a few weeks ago, maintained his stance on Tuesday, as hereposted a Kalshi betting pollthat stated the “odds of Musk creating a new political party in 2025 surge to 41%.”\n\nRead More:Senate Narrowly Passes Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill,’ Sending It Back to House\n\nDuring the series of posts shared with his more than 220 million followers, Musk seemingly committed tocampaigning against any Republicansthat showed their support for the bill. “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame,”he said. “And they will lose their primary next year, if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”\n\nMusk also ramped up his support, and donated towards the re-election campaign, of Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who hasincurred the wrath of Trumpdue to being one of the bill’s key critics.\n\nThis all comes afterMusk, in June, saidthe “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” He took things a step further by telling his millions of followers to “call your Senator, call your Congressman… kill the bill!”\n\nIt’s a sharp turnaround for Musk, who actively campaigned for Trump in 2024 and shared the stage with him at significant rallies. Musk’s super political action committee (PAC), America PAC, reportedly spentaround $200 millionto help elect Trump, making the Tesla CEO Trump’s largest, and most prominent, donor in the 2024 election.\n\nIn response to Musk’s most recent opposition to his bill, Trump delivered a stark warning to his former ally on Tuesday morning.\n\nWhenasked by reportersif he is going to deport Musk, who has U.S. and South African citizenship, Trump replied: “I don’t know, we’ll have to take a look.”\n\n“We might have to put DOGE on Elon. The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible?” Trump teased, seemingly referring to the contracts and subsidies that Musk’s prominent businesses have from the federal government.\n\nMusk initially floated the idea of establishing a new political party in the U.S. in early June, during the height of hisfeud with Trump, that took a personal turn when it crossed over into social media.\n\nAmid posts critical of the policy bill and Trump himself, Musk hadasked X usersto vote in a poll as to whether a new political party should be established that “actually represents the 80% in the middle.”\n\n80% of respondents voted yes, leading Musk to say: “The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!”\n\nAside from saying his new political party would “represent” the middle, and more recently suggesting he will back primary challengers against Republicans in Congress who supported the bill, Musk has yet to share any specific proposed policies or highlight what the core tenets of his party would be.\n\nRead More:Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Faces Opposition From Musk and Some RepublicansAttempts to establish a successful third party in U.S. politics have long proven to be difficult and near-impossible.Andrew Yang has pushed for representationbeyond the two-party system, but the former2020 Democratic presidential primary candidatehas arguably had limited success with his Forward Party.\n\nHowever, in light of Musk’s eagerness to create a new third party, Yang is keen to join forces with the Tesla CEO.\n\n“Elon has built world-class companies from nothing more than an idea multiple times, and in this instance, you have the vast majority of Americans who are hungry for a new approach,” Yang said in aninterview with Politico in June. “I’m happy to spell it out for Elon, or anyone else who wants to head down this road. A third party can succeed very quickly.”\n\nMeanwhile, in 2021, in response to the Jan. 6 Capitol Riots, over a hundred anti-Trump Republicans threatened to breakaway and form a party of their own, should the GOP not distance itself from Trump. But the idea failedto gain any significant momentum.",

BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!\"\n\nThe tech billionaire wrote in reply: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"\n\nMusk has repeatedly criticised Trump's so-called \"big, beautiful bill\", suggesting that it undermines the work he undertook to cut government spending.\n\nA row between Trump and Musk first blew up last month, with the pair trading barbs publicly before Musk backtracked on some of his attacks.\n\nCongress is currently voting on Trump's bill. The president's Republican Party holds majorities in both chambers, though some lawmakers in the party have voted against it - siding with opposition Democrats.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes increased spending for border security, defence and energy production that would be partially offset by controversial cuts to healthcare and food-support programmes.\n\nMusk was in charge of Doge (the Department of Government Efficiency), which has been tasked with finding ways of cutting government spending, until his acrimonious White House departure over the \"big, beautiful bill\".\n\nTrump has suggested that the dissent from the Tesla and SpaceX owner relates to a part of his bill that would remove incentives to buy electric vehicles, such as those Musk produces.\n\nThe president has also threatened to remove government subsidies from which Musk's companies benefit.\n\n\"He's upset that he's losing his EV mandate, he's very upset, he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you that,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Doge is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. He gets a lot of subsidies,\" he added.\n\nMusk, however, has argued he is ideologically committed to cutting government spending. If passed, Trump's bill would add an estimated $3.3tn (£2.4tn) to the national debt.\n\nAmong a string of posts on his social media platform X while voting took place, Musk shared a graph showing US debt over time with the caption: \"When are they going to flatten this curve?\"\n\nIn another, he wrote: \"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\"\n\nMusk said he would make sure these lawmakers lost their primary races next year. The billionaire businessman - who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump's re-election bid last year - has even touted the idea establishing a new party to run against both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nIn an apparent response to Trump's claim about EV incentives, Musk reposted a clip from an interview in which he said removing them would see Tesla's \"competitive position would improve significantly\".\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",

And, you know, you go back and look at what happened in 2017 when we lowered rates and created a good atmosphere to create jobs, then we saw millions of jobs get created. And we're at the point again today where the economy is waiting for this bill.\"\n\nMusk, who criticized the House version of the bill before appearing to back off, has launched another tirade against the legislation this week while it's being pushed through the Senate.\n\nSENATE REPUBLICANS RAM TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' THROUGH KEY TEST VOTE\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, left, said Elon Musk's criticism has \"no basis.\"(Getty Images)\n\n\"It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS, that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!! Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people,\" Musk posted on X.\n\nBut Scalise told Fox News Digital, \"We're moving fast to get it done because of the positive impacts it will have on our economy.\"\n\nThe Senate is expected to pass the legislation sometime Wednesday, after which it is poised to move back to theHouse of Representatives.\n\nAn earlier version passed the House in late May by just one vote, but the two chambers must now sync up to get a bill on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.\n\nTwo sources told Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning that House GOP leaders are still planning for a 12 p.m. House Rules Committee meeting to advance the bill.\n\nThe House Rules Committee is the final gateway before most legislation gets a chamber-wide vote.\n\nPresident Trump's agenda on tax, border, energy, defense and the national debt is being advanced in the bill.(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\n\nThat could tee up a procedural vote on the bill as early as Wednesday morning, and final passage by Wednesday evening or Thursday.\n\n\"I've always said failure's not an option because, you know, there have been many times where the bill could have fallen apart. And it didn't, because we always stayed focused on getting it done,\" Scalise said. \"And that's that's where all the focus needs to be right now.\"\n\nBut the Senate's various modifications to the bill have angered both moderate and conservative Republicans.\n\nDEM DELAY TACTIC ENDS, DEBATE BEGINS ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\n\nModerates are wary of the Senate measures that would shift more Medicaid costs to states that expanded their programs under ObamaCare, while conservatives have saidthose cuts are not enoughto offset the additional spending in other parts of the bill.\n\n\"We're having a lot of conversations with our members, and we are following what changes are being made to the bill because some could help fix some of those issues,\" Scalise said.\n\n\"We're definitely aware of the concerns from our members. But there are a lot of other members that do want to get this bill passed for the president and recognize that the bulk of what we sent over to them is still intact.\"\n\nAsked if he was optimistic about the timeline as of early Monday evening, Scalise said, \"The plan is still to bring members back and have votes as early as Wednesday morning.\"\n\nThe legislation is a 940-page bill advancing Trump's agenda on taxes, the border, defense, energy and the national debt.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Musk for comment via email to Tesla.\n\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.
