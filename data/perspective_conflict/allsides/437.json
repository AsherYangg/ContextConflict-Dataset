        "source_1": "NEW YORK − A judge in Daniel Penny's case on Friday dismissed a charge of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Jordan Neely, leaving the jury to consider a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. Prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the first more serious count after jurors remained deadlocked Friday afternoon.\n\nNeely, anunarmed homeless man, died after former Marine Penny placed him in a chokehold on a crowded subway car last year. Neely had beenscreaming at passengers.\n\nA jury began deliberations this week after hearing more than a month's worth of witness testimonies and evidence presented by lawyers. They sent a note to the judge Friday morning saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict on the charge of manslaughter, defense attorney Steve Raiser told USA TODAY. The judge responded with instructions to keep deliberating, Raiser said.\n\nCourt was adjourned late Friday afternoon and the jury will continue deliberating Monday, Raiser said.\n\nVideo ofNeely's death gained national attention and sparked days of protest in New York after police questioned Penny and initially released him from custody after the killing on May 1, 2023. Neely, a Michael Jackson tribute artist, waswell-known in and around Times Square, where he danced dressed up like the pop icon.\n\nPenny told responding officers that Neely, 30, \"came on the train threatening people. I put him out\" to keep him from harming fellow subway riders, according to court documents.\n\nDuring the trial, which began with jury selection Oct. 21, Penny, 26, was accused ofrecklessly disregarding the riskhis chokehold would lead to Neely's death that day on the train car floor.\n\nPenny's charge of second-degree manslaughter would have carried a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and the conviction of criminally negligent homicide could carry a sentence of up to four years, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said. But there is no minimum prison sentence, and if he's found guilty, the judge could decide on a sentence that involves no prison time, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran argued Penny should have known Neely's life was at risk as the approximately 6-minute-long chokehold starved the 30-year-old Black man of oxygen. Yoran also argued Penny was unnecessarily reckless when he continued to hold Neely's neck long after Neely stopped posing a threat to passengers.\n\nPenny's defense argued Neely was acting \"psychotic\" and threatened to kill people in the subway car. Penny stepped in to protect all the people onboard, several of whom Neely lunged at before Penny placed him in the chokehold, defense attorney Thomas Kenniff said. Passengers had no way of knowing Neely did not have a weapon on him, Kenniff said, and several passengers feared for their life.\n\nThe defense team also argued Penny's chokehold alone could not have caused Neely's death, and that Neely's blood suffered an extreme sickle cell crisis on the train floor, blocking the flow of oxygen. However, a medical examiner testified Neely's death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" and not other health issues.\n\nWho was Jordan Neely?A 'young man in real crisis,' advocates say\n\nThe prosecution argued Penny did not hesitate before placing Neely in a chokehold and failed to try to defuse the situation another way. Another bystander who came to Penny's aid offered to hold Neely's arms down so Penny could let go of Neely's neck, but instead Penny kept tight hold even after Neely's body went limp, Yoran told jurors.\n\n\"He used far too much force for far too long,\" Yoran said.\n\nThroughout the trial, about a dozen protesters gathered outside the Manhattan Criminal Court most mornings,demanding justice for Neely and his family. The demonstrators' chants could be heard from the street below inside the 13th floor courtroom, and on the first day of the trial, Judge Max Wiley instructed the jury to ignore the noise and focus on the evidence presented by lawyers.\n\nNeely experienced mental health problems throughout his life, according to court records, and was homeless off and on since he was a teenager, when his mother was brutally murdered by her boyfriend in the family's home in New Jersey.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Neely entered the F subway train in Lower Manhattan and immediately began yelling, saying he was ready to go to jail for life, court records show. Kenniff also pointed to evidence that Neely suffered from schizophrenia and was high on K2, a synthetic cannabinoid, at the time of the incident.\n\nJurors' personal experiences with violent crime, mental illness and drug use in the nation's largest city − particularly on the subway − likely play a major role in their deliberations, said David Barnard, a lawyer and director of jury selection at Magna Legal Services who has studied the case.\n\nDuring jury selection, prospective jurors were asked about their experiences riding the transit system. Some who were selected said they ride the subway regularly and saw outbursts like that of Neely, said Barnard, who was not involved in the case.\n\n\"Some people can see outbursts and say this is typical, run-of-the-mill New York City,\" said Barnard, who lives in Brooklyn. At the same time, many New Yorkers may feel the massive subway system is unsafe and out-of-control, Barnard said.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe jury in Daniel Penny's case will continue deliberations on Monday after they had trouble coming to a verdict this week.\n\nNew York Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the 26-year-old's manslaughter charge on Friday after the jury wasdeadlockedafter nearly20 hours of deliberations. This will allow them to focus on whether Penny is guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe jury is tasked with determining whether Penny is guilty of killing Jordan Neely, 30, a homeless man, with achokeholdon a New York City subway in 2023.\n\nEarlier Friday, Wiley instructed the jury to continue deliberations and denied a request by Penny's defense attorneys to declare a mistrial.\n\n\"It's not time for a mistrial,\" Wiley told the attorneys without the jury present,CNNreported, adding that a new trial may be required on the lesser charge if no agreement is reached on the top count.\n\nThe verdict must be unanimous. If the jurors can't all agree—a hung jury—the judge will have to declare a mistrial. At that point, the case is not dismissed but may be retried with a new jury. The prosecution will decide whether to proceed based on factors such as the severity of the issues in the original trial and the chances of a clear outcome in a new trial.\n\nAndrew C. McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, predicted the jury would be unable to reach a decision. In an article for the National Review, he noted the decision to retry Penny would be up to Manhattan District AttorneyAlvin Bragg.\n\nMcCarthy said retrying Penny would likely please the progressive base that helped get Bragg elected in New York City. But Penny's trial has sparked backlash, as some see him as a person who was defending others on the train and is being improperly prosecuted. So if Bragg has his sights set on a statewide office, it might be more beneficial to him to drop the case if there is a mistrial because of a hung jury.\n\nIn 1996,Erik and Lyle Menendez'sfirst trial for the murder of their parents ended in a hung jury, leading to a retrial in which they were eventually convicted.\n\nBill Cosby'sfirst sexual assault trial in 2004 ended in a mistrial after the jury could not reach a verdict. In 2017, he was retried on charges related to the sexual assault of Andrea Constand and found guilty.\n\nPenny was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death. Before the judge dismissed the top charge, the jury could only consider the criminally negligent homicide charge if they found Penny not guilty of manslaughter.\n\nAfter four days and 20 hours of deliberation, the jury remained deadlocked. Penny pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.\n\nIf convicted, Penny could face up to 15 years for manslaughter or up to four years for criminally negligent homicide, though the judge may opt for no prison time.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachary,filed a civil lawsuitagainst Penny for negligence and assault, which Penny's legal team criticized as \"unfortunate\" while awaiting a verdict.\n\nPenny's defense claims Neely reportedly behaved erratically and yelled threats at passengers on the F train on May 1, 2023. The confrontation lasted several minutes and was partially captured on video, sparking widespread public debate.\n\nHis defense argues that Penny acted to protect fellow passengers, citing his Marine Corps training and Neely's perceived threat. They dispute the city medical examiner's office's conclusion that the chokehold is what caused Neely's death. They say it resulted from a combination of synthetic marijuana use (\"K2\"), schizophrenia, a genetic condition, and his physical altercation with Penny, as testified by a defense pathologist.\n\nProsecutors contend Penny used excessive force, noting that Neely had not physically attacked anyone and that the prolonged chokehold led to his death.\n\nUpdated, 12/6/24 at 4:57 p.m. ET: New details and information were added.\n\nDo you have a storyNewsweekshould be covering?

        "source_3": "Manhattan prosecutors were forced to take the drastic step of tossing the top charge against Daniel Penny Friday after jurors twice said they couldn’t agree on a verdict in the highly watched subway chokehold case.The note from jurors stating that they were deadlocked on the count of manslaughter in the second-degree sparked a dizzying and dramatic back-and-forth that ended with Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley agreeing to dismiss the rap.\n\n“I’ll take a chance and grant the people’s application,” Wiley said, instructing the jury to return Monday and deliberate the charge of criminally negligent homicide, which carries a lighter sentence.\n\n“Whether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea. But I’m going to direct you to focus your deliberations on count two,” he said with a touch of deadpan humor — before telling them: “Go home and think about something else.”\n\nThe decision came hours after jurors’ first note saying they couldn’t agree on whether to convict Penny, 26, of manslaughter for putting the troubled 30-year-old homeless man in a six-minute chokehold during the May 2023 encounter on a Manhattan F train.\n\nThe 12-person panel had been instructed by Wiley that they first needed to reach a verdict on the top count before they could consider the lesser criminally negligent homicide rap.\n\nDeliberations began on Tuesday afternoon in the lightning-rod case that has sparked fierce debate over whether Penny was justified in grabbing and holding Neely by the neck after he got on the car yelling and scaring passengers.\n\nManslaughter, which carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison, requires prosecutors proving that a person recklessly caused someone else’s death. The second count, which carries a sentence of probation to four years behind bars, is when a person acts with “criminal negligence” by failing to perceive the risk of their actions but going through with it anyway.\n\nJurors had also requested shortly before the lunch break that the judge clarify the term “reasonable person” — a concept that applies to Penny’s justification defense.\n\nTo acquit him on justification grounds, the jury would have to decide that if the Marine veteran used deadly physical force, it was necessary for him to do so to defend himself and others on the subway — and whether a “reasonable person” in Penny’s shoes would have acted the same way.\n\n“Ultimately what a reasonable person is is up to you to decide,” the judge said, adding: “Hope that helps.”\n\nThey also sent two notes saying that they were at an impasse in deciding whether Penny “recklessly” caused Neely’s death.\n\nThe judge suggested that he might consider ordering a mistrial in the whole case rather than order one on just the top charge as jurors considered weighing the second. Wiley said he would have done this so as not to lead to a “compromise verdict,” which New York state courts try to avoid.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said that “it would be a crazy result” for the case to end in a mistrial without first seeing if the jury might reach a verdict on the lesser count.\n\nShe could then be seen pacing around the courtroom on her cell phone and talking to District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office staff in the front row of the gallery.\n\nThe veteran homicide prosecutor left the room, but returned minutes later alongside Steven Wu, the chief of the DA’s office’s appeals bureau. Wu then argued to the judge that axing the manslaughter charge would eliminate the threat of a compromised split verdict.\n\nPenny’s defense attorneys still objected to the judge dropping the top count, slamming the move as a possible ploy to “coerce” jurors to reach what they called a “compromise” verdict.\n\n“The law is clear that compromised verdicts are to be avoided,” attorney Thomas Kenniff told the court. “This is essentially elbowing the 12 members of the jury to do just that.”\n\nWiley sided with the prosecutors, despite Kenniff pleading that “I am not aware of any case where this has been permitted.”\n\n“I think the defense has correctly stated what the law is, but the DA’s proposal would eliminate the issue that you are citing,” the judge said.\n\nThe dismissal means that Bragg’s office cannot retry Penny on the stiffer charge, no matter what the jury decides to do when they pick up deliberations on Monday.\n\nBefore dismissing the jury for the weekend, Wiley informed them that the court had tossed the manslaughter charge — without explaining the unusual series of events that had led to the dismissal.\n\nBoth counts deal with the question of justification, but jurors can convict on criminally negligent homicide if they find that Penny failed to identify the risk that his chokehold could kill the troubled homeless man, and that he should have known that Neely could have died.\n\nPenny’s lawyers have said theLong Island native and aspiring architect was justifiedin protecting passengers from a man who witnesses said yelled, “Someone’s going to die today!” and who said he was ready to go to jail after boarding the uptown F train.\n\nBut prosecutors have stressed thatno witness testified that Neely threatened anyone specifically, touched anyone, or brandished a weapon. Police later found only a muffin in his pocket.\n\nThe case has spawned contentious debate and led to scrutiny over how Neely fell through the cracks of a broken city mental health system despite reporting his mental illness to authorities during more than a dozen prior run-ins with cops.\n\nPenny now faces up to four years in prison on the lesser charge, but it’s unclear how stiff a sentence Bragg’s office would ask for if he’s convicted."
