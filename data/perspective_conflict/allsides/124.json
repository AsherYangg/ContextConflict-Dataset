Our earlier reporting is below.\n\nU.S. officials have been told Israel is fullyready to launchan operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News.\n\nThe U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S.advised some Americans to leavethe region earlier Wednesday. The State Departmentorderednon-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to \"heightened regional tensions,\" and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations throughout the Middle East, a defense official told CBS News.\n\nPresident Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.\n\nA reporter asked Mr. Trump Thursday if an Israeli strike on Iran is imminent. \"Well, I don't want to say imminent, but it looks like it's something that could very well happen,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump spoke about Iran at an appearance at the Kennedy Center Wednesday evening, telling reporters Americans were advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump also reiterated the U.S. did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, saying: \"We're not going to allow that.\"\n\nWhen asked at the White House why dependents of military personnel were allowed to voluntarily leave the region, Mr. Trump said, \"You'll have to see.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters Wednesday that if nuclear talks fail and \"a conflict is imposed on us,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"will target all U.S. bases in the host countries.\"\n\nA source familiar with the situation and a U.S. official told CBS News that the Trump administration was weighing options regarding how to support Israeli military action without leading it. Those options could include aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but the U.S. official was unaware of any commitment.\n\nThe source familiar said the options are unlikely to include direct participation by U.S. B-2 bombers that carry the type of bombs that can penetrate Iran's deep underground fortified uranium enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Without that type of strike by U.S. B-2 bombers, it is unlikely Israeli military action could destroy the underground portions of Iran's program, and thus solo military action by Israel is presumed to be limited in its capability to fully eliminate the program.\n\nThe U.S. official said the U.S. could help defend Israel against Iranian ballistic missiles in case of a counterattack, as it did during the two tit-for-tat episodes between Iran and Israel inApril 2024andOctober 2024.\n\nThe U.K. Maritime Trade Organization on Wednesdayadvised shipsto exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman — three key waterways for the global oil trade — due to \"increased tensions within the region which could lead to an escalation of military activity.\"\n\nIsraeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment.\n\nThe Trump administrationhas sought a dealwith Iran to limit the country's nuclear program, asinternational watchdogssay the country has continued to enrich uranium to near-weapons level. The talks are delicate, and it's unclear how close the two sides are to a deal: Mr. Trump hassaidhe will not accept any uranium enrichment by Iran, but Iranian leaders haveindicatedthey won't accept those terms, the president said earlier this week.\n\nFor years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's officesaysIsrael has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trumpsaid publiclyhe had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.\n\n\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nIran's nuclear programdates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.\n\nIn 2015, former President Barack Obama struck a deal with Iranlimiting the scopeof the country's uranium enrichment program, over the objections of Netanyahu, who alleged Iran is unreliable and hadcovertly violatedthe agreement. Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern countryexpanded its stockpileof highly enriched uranium.\n\nIn areporttwo weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated Iran had enriched 408.6 kilograms of uranium up to 60% purity — which is very close to the 90% enrichment level required to build a nuclear weapon. That's a significant jump from the 274.8-kilogram stockpile the United Nations agency had estimated in February.\n\nIn testimony on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, \"There are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nOlivia  Gazis,Sara  CookandKhaled  Wassefcontributed to this report.\n\nJennifer Jacobs is a senior White House reporter at CBS News.",
        "source_2": "Non-essential US embassy staff and their dependants in Baghdad are to be evacuated from Iraq due to heightened security risks, US government sources have said.\n\nOfficials did not say exactly what prompted the removal, but have been told Israel was ready to launch an operation into Iran, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.\n\nThis was part of the reason some Americans were advised to leave the region, officials said, adding that they anticipated Iran could retaliate on certain US sites in Iraq. US officials have also restricted the movements of staff within Israel itself.\n\nIt comes as US talks over Iran's nuclear programme appear to have stalled in recent days.\n\nUS Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning on holding talks with Iran about its nuclear programme on Sunday, officials told CBS.\n\nWitkoff will meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Muscat, Axios reported.\n\nA US state department official told the BBC: \"We are constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all our embassies.\n\n\"Based on our latest analysis, we decided to reduce the footprint of our mission in Iraq.\"\n\nThe department later said it was also restricting US government staff from travelling within Israel outside the areas of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Be'er Sheva - due to what it called \"increased regional tensions\".\n\nSpeaking at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on Wednesday evening, US President Donald Trump told reporters Americans had been advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens\".\n\nTrump also reiterated that the US did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. \"We're not going to allow that,\" he said.\n\nThe president has hoped to strike a deal to stop Tehran developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nEarlier this week, he held a 40-minute phone call, which was said to be \"tense\", with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long argued for a military rather than diplomatic approach.\n\nOn Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) board of governors began a meeting in Vienna to discuss Iran's nuclear programme and other issues.\n\nIt comes after the IAEA released a report criticising the \"less than satisfactory\" co-operation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.\n\nIran described the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying that it relied on \"forged documents\" provided by Israel.\n\nWith the nuclear talks at a critical moment, it is not yet clear how much the US announcement is about signalling as opposed to genuine concern.\n\nBut Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said his country would retaliate against US bases in the region if talks failed and Trump ordered military strikes against the Islamic Republic.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also approved the voluntary departure of families of American military personnel from countries across the Middle East, including Kuwait and Bahrain, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nTestifying in front of a congressional panel on Wednesday, the Pentagon said he believed there were \"plenty of indications\" that Iran was \"moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon\".\n\nIran says its uranium enrichment programme was for civilian energy generation and that it was not trying to build an atomic bomb.\n\nThe UK's Maritime Trade Operations organisation - part of the Royal Navy - warned on Wednesday that increased military tensions in the Middle East could affect shipping.\n\nThe price of oil initially increased more than 4% when news of the US evacuation broke, in anticipation of regional insecurity potentially leading to supply problems.\n\nAround 2,500 US troops are based in Iraq, according to the defence department.\n\nIn January 2020, Iranfired missiles at air bases housing US forcesin Iraq in retaliation for the US strike that killed top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nNo US military personnel stationed at the base were killed, but dozens were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

        "source_3": "We could soon see an attack from Israel against Iran,as CBS News is reporting, citing \"multiple sources.\" This comes as, Stephen Green at our sister site of PJ Mediareported earlier, the United States has been anticipating heightened tensions and the Trump administration, via Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has \"authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East.\"\n\nAccording to CBS News, U.S. officials have been told Israel is now “fully ready” to launch an operation into Iran, with this being a primary reason for the announced evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and General Consulate in Erbil, as well as the departure of military…pic.twitter.com/YjGQBClFhv\n\nU.S. officials have been told Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News.\n\nThe U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region earlier Wednesday, with the State Departmentorderingnon-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to \"heightened regional tensions.\"\n\nPresident Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.\n\nGreene explained the authorizations more fully in his piece, though such a piece came earlier in the day and also later included an update:\n\n\"Authorized\" in this case means that State or Defense will provide and pay for transportation, if requested. It isn't like an embassy spouse isn't allowed to travel without permission.\n\nAnother anonymous U.S. official told the Independent that the Pentagon is on alert to support any potential bugout: \"The State Department is set to have an ordered departure for (the) U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The intent is to do it through commercial means, but the U.S. military is standing by if help is requested.\"\n\nSo while today's news isn't the most comforting stuff you'll read today, pulling our people out of various Middle East embassies doesn't mean that war is about to break out — aside from the war in Gaza, the civil war in Yemen, whatever it is you want to call the situation in Syria, Turkey's war against various Kurdish groups, etc.\n\nCome to think of it, it's almost a miracle we bother having embassy people in those places at all. If Trump could even the score with Soleimani by remote control, wouldn't it be a lot safer (and less expensive) to wage most of our Middle East diplomacy via Zoom calls?\n\nI'm mostly kidding, of course, but it's no laughing matter to the families and staff constantly going on alert. Wash, rinse, evacuate — in the Middle East, the cycle never ends.\n\nAs for what President Donald Trump and his administration have to say, there's been reminders about what \"a dangerous place\" the Middle East can be.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who along with First Lady Melania Trump and Vice President JD Vance as well as Second Lady Usha Vance are at the Kennedy Center for the opening night ofLes Misérables,did speak to the press about how Americans were advised to leave the region, \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Trump, according to the report, also reiterated \"we're not going to allow that\" when it comes to Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Trump has been strongly against the idea since he started running for president.\n\nThe CBS News report did also note that \"Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment.\"\n\nIf Israel were to strike Iran, this looks like it would reportedly be against Trump's wishes. \"Trump tells Netanyahu to end Gaza war and stop Iran threats, source says, as US ramps up pressure on Israel,\" read a headline from CNN earlier on Wednesday."
