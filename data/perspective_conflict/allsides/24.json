The first-quarter drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports — which are subtracted from GDP — as businesses scrambled to bring in foreign goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAP business correspondent Damian Troise reports the U.S. second quarter GDP showed an unexpected economic rebound.\n\nThe bounceback was expected but its strength was a surprise: Economists had forecast 2% growth from April through June.\n\nFrom April through June, a drop in imports — the biggest since the COVID-19 outbreak — added more than 5 percentage points to growth. Consumer spending registered lackluster growth of 1.4%, though it was an improvement over the first quarter’s 0.5%.\n\nPrivate investment fell at a 15.6% annual pace, biggest drop since COVID-19 slammed the economy. A drop in inventories — as businesses worked down goods they’d stockpiled in the first quarter — shaved 3.2 percentage points off second-quarter growth.\n\nA category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength weakened in the second quarter, expanding at a 1.2% annual pace, down from 1.9% from January through March and the weakest since the end of 2022. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.\n\nFederal government spending and investment fell at a 3.7% annual rate on top of a 4.6% drop in the first quarter.\n\nWednesday’s GDP report showed inflationary pressure easing in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge – the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index – rose at an annual rate of 2.1% in the second quarter, down from 3.7% in the first. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation rose 2.5%, down from 3.5% in the first quarter.\n\nOn his Truth Social media platform, Trump heralded the GDP gain and stepped up his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates: “2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED! “Too Late” MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!’'\n\nTrump sees tariffs as a way toprotect American industry, lure factories back to the United States and help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\nBut mainstream economists — viewed with disdain by Trump and his advisers — say that his tariffswill damage the economy, raising costs and making protected U.S. companies less efficient. They note that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. Therefore, tariffs can be inflationary — though their impact so far has been modest.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

        "source_3": "So much for that imports-driven mini recession in Q1.\n\nOne quarter after liberal economists cried with delight when the US economy contracted as a result of a surge in imports (even as consumption remained solid) and which they said was the definitive confirmation Trump is the antichrist and the US economy is headed for another Great Depression, moments ago the Bureau of Econ Analysis reported that the first estimate of Q2 GDP came in at an unexpectedly brisk 3.0%, a complete reversal of the -0.5% decline in Q1...\n\n... and well above the 2.6% estimate, if inside the 1-sigma upper distribution band.\n\nThe increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP (and thus boosted bottom-line GDP), and an increase in consumer spending. These movements were partly offset by decreases in investment and exports.\n\nCompared to the first quarter, the upturn in real GDP in the second quarterreflected a downturn in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partly offset by a downturn in investment.Looking at the contribution of various components, we find the following:\n\nWhile Personal Consumption was a tad weaker than expected, printing at an annualized 1.4%, below the 1.5% estimate, but above the 0.5% in Q1...\n\n... it was the fixed investment print of just 0.1% that was concerning: why were no Data Centers counted?\n\nAnd another somewhat troubling update: real final sales to private domestic purchasers, the sum of consumer spending and gross private fixed investment, increased 1.2% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 1.9% in the first quarter.\n\nOn the inflation side, the data came in mixed, with the GDP price index printing 2.0%, down from 3.8% in Q1 and below the 2.2% expected, while core PCE printed 2.5%, down from 3.5% but above the 2.3% expected. It is now up to the Fed to decide what to do with this data later today.\n\nCommetning on the data, TradeStation head of market strategy David Russell said that \"the economy rebounded as trade normalized in Q2. Investors will be happy to see the stronger growth, but core PCE is still running on the high side. This is an inconclusive number for the market overall, with continued red flags on inflation – especially with companies citing the impact of tariffs on earnings. The Fed could remain on guard against rising price pressures.\"\n\nOverall, this was a stronger than expected print, yet one which merely normalizes for all the trade/tariff noise from Q1, and one which should probably be looked at as an average between the Q1 and Q2 prints,in which case the US economy is probably growing somewhere around 1.3-1.4%,  similar to what the (slowing) Real Final Sales indicate.\n\nMoments after the report, Trump blasted on Truth Social that 2Q GDP was \"WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED! “Too Late” MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE.\"\n\nActually, GDP coming in hot means the Fed should not cut rates, and instead what Trump should be focusing on is the slow down in Real Final Sales.\n\nIn any case, since the Fed will not cut today, expect some very angry Double Bolded, Underlined and ALL CAPS tweets at exactly 2:01pm today."
