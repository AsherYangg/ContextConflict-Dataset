        "source_1": "Special counsel Jack Smith isdropping the federal election subversionand the mishandling of classified documents cases against President-electDonald Trump, seeking the cases’ dismissal in court filings Monday.\n\nTrump has said he would fire Smith once he retook the office, shattering previous norms around special counsel investigations.\n\nLive updatesThe latest on Trump’s presidential transition\n\n“The (Justice) Department’s position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,” Smith wrote of the election subversion case in a six-page filing with US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC. “This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant.”\n\nChutkanformally dismissed the case without prejudiceMonday afternoon.\n\nSmith’s criminal pursuit of Trump over the last two years for trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election and his mishandling of classified documents represented a unique chapter in American history: Never before has a former occupant of the White House faced federal criminal charges.\n\nThough the election subversion case culminated this summer in alandmark Supreme Court rulingthat said Trump enjoyed some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, Trump’s strategy of delay in the case ensured that a trial never got underway before the November election.\n\nIn the election case Trump faced in Washington, DC, Smith charged the former president over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, a plot that culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n“The Government’s position on the merits of the defendant’s prosecution has not changed,” Smith said in the filing.\n\nRelated articleExclusive: The inside story of John Roberts and Trump’s immunity win at the Supreme Court\n\nChutkan had been deciding how much of Trump’s conduct at the center of the case was shielded by immunity after prosecutors last month laid out their arguments for why the Supreme Court’s ruling should have no impact on the case. After Trump won reelection this month, prosecutors asked Chutkan to pause a series of postelection deadlines in the case as they weighed their next steps.\n\nIn the documents case brought in Florida, Trump was indicted for allegedly taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all charges in both cases.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung in a statement called the move “a major victory for the rule of law.”\n\n“The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country,” Cheung added.\n\nSmith,in a filingwith a federal appeals court, said that prosecutors were keeping their case on mishandling classified documents alive against two of Trump’s employees.\n\nThe case is before the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is reviewingJudge Aileen Cannon’s orderdismissing all charges.\n\nThe co-defendants are Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, who work for Trump and are accused of helping the former president obstruct a federal investigation into sensitive government documents taken from his first administration. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\n“The special counsel’s decision to proceed in this case, even after dismissing it against President Trump, is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,” John Irving, a defense attorney for De Oliveira, said. “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that’s fine with us.”\n\nA lawyer for Nauta, Stanley Woodward, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSmith said he was seeking to drop the charges against the president-elect “without prejudice,” which would keep the door open for charges to be brought again in the future, calling the presidential immunity Trump will have as “temporary.”\n\nSmith said he consulted with Justice Department lawyers on the question and that they also weighed the possibility of pausing the case until Trump no longer had the immunity of the presidency protecting him.\n\nUltimately, however, the department’s Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the bar on prosecuting sitting presidents is “categorial,” including for indictments handed up before a defendant enters office.\n\n“Accordingly, the Department’s position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated. And although the Constitution requires dismissal in this context, consistent with the temporary nature of the immunity afforded a sitting President, it does not require dismissal with prejudice,” Smith wrote.\n\nIn her ruling on Monday, Chutkan noted the unusual circumstances.\n\n“Dismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the Government’s understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office,” the judge wrote.\n\nAs president, Trump will not have the power to interfere with the prosecutions brought against him by state authorities in Georgia and New York. However, the courts in those cases will still have to work out immunity questions and issues raised by his return to the White House.\n\nLast week, the judge overseeing Trump’s criminal hush money case in New Yorkpostponed his sentencingindefinitely. A jury in the state convicted Trump earlier this yearon 34 countsof falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during the 2016 campaign to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged a prior affair with the president-elect. (Trump denies the affair.)\n\nAnd Trump is still working to stave off prosecution in Georgia, where he is a defendant in a sprawling case that accuses him and several allies of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the Peach State.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "source_3": "Special Counsel Jack Smith is winding down both federal criminal cases he brought against President-elect Donald Trump before they go to trial.\n\nSmith, on Monday,fileda motion to dismiss the election interference case against Trump in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, marking a major victory for the president-elect:\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Department has determined that OLC’s prior opinions concerning the Constitution’s prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting President apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\n\nMoreover, Smith thenfileda motion in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to dismiss an appeal in the documents case, which “will leave in place the district court’s order dismissing the indictment without prejudice as to him.” Smith cites the reasoning laid out in his motion to dismiss the election interference case:\n\nFor the reasons set forth in United States v. Trump, No. 23-cr-57, ECF No. 281 (D.D.C.) (filed Nov. 25, 2024) (moving to dismiss criminal prosecution as to defendant Trump in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia), the United States of America moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42 and Eleventh Circuit Rule 42-1, to dismiss the appeal in this case as to defendant Trump.\n\nTaken together, the moves mark the end of the federal prosecutions against the president-elect, leaving two remaining cases at the state level in Georgia and New York.\n\n“Now even Jack Smith admits the Left’s lawfare against President Trump has failed,” David Bossie, president of Citizens United, said. “When President Trump returns to the White House on January 20, the rule of law will return with him.”\n\nSteven Cheung, the incoming White House communications director, touted the enormous legal victories in a statement shared with Breitbart News on Monday, shortly after Smith’s filings.\n\n“The American People re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to Make America Great Again. Today’s decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law,” Cheung said.\n\n“The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country,” he added.\n\nBreitbart News senior legal contributor Ken Klukowski also underscored the gravity of Smith’s actions.\n\n“This is a huge victory for President Trump and the rule of law,” said Klukowski, who filed briefs supporting President Trump on behalf of former U.S. Attorneys General Ed Meese and Michael Mukasey and also Citizens United. “Jack Smith’s appointment as Special Counsel was unconstitutional from the outset, and Smith’s surrender here is long overdue.”\n\nThe decisions by Smith and the DOJ will also have animpactin the New York business records case against Trump. Judge Juan Merchan has granted Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove a December 2 deadline to file a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nBlanche and Bove noted in a letter to Merchan last week that they would address the positions the DOJ takes in the federal cases in their filing.\n\nThe cases areUnited States v. Trump,No. 23-cr-257 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia andUnited States v. Trump, No. 24-12311-J in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit."
