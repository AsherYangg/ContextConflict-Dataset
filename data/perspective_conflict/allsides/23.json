        "source_1": "The \"missing minute\" from the surveillance video at the Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center where Jeffrey Epstein died in 2019 may not be missing after all, CBS News has learned.\n\nWhen theJustice Department and FBIreleased nearly 11 hours of footage earlier this month, the time code on the screen jumped forward one minute just before midnight, prompting questions about the one-minute gap. The video shows part of the area near the cell where Epstein was being held the night hediedin what the medical examinerruled a suicide.\n\nA government source familiar with the investigation says the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice inspector general are all in possession of a copy of the video that does not cut from just before 11:59 p.m. to midnight of the night Epstein died by suicide in his cell.\n\nWhat is unclear is why that section was missing when the FBI released what it said was raw footage from inside the Special Housing Unit the night Epstein died, Aug. 9-10, 2019. The recording came from what officials said was the only relevant video camera that was recording its footage in the unit. This video has been cited by multiple government officials as akey piece of evidencein the determination that Epstein died by suicide.\n\nEpstein's death, as with many aspects of his high-profilesex trafficking case, has become fodder for conspiracy theories. The missing minute added to the conjecture after the release of the video, when news organizations and amateur sleuths who reviewed the video quickly noticed that onscreen jump in the time stamp.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi was questioned about the gap during a July 8 Cabinet meeting with President Trump. She said the missing minute was the result of a nightly reset of the video that caused the recording system to miss one recording minute every night, and attributed that information to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\n\"There was a minute that was off that counter and what we learned from [the] Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,\" Bondi said. The equipment was old — \"from like 1999, so every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute,\" she said.\n\nBondi said the department would share other video that showed the same thing happened every night when the video system reset. That video, however, has not yet been released.\n\nExperts in surveillance video, including video forensic professionals, told CBS News that a nightly reset would have been unusual and was not something they encountered in most video systems.\n\nOne thing that is clear, forensic experts say, is that the version of the recording released by the FBI was edited and not raw, as the government stated. Bondi, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and others have said publicly that the video would be released unaltered.\n\nWhen the DOJ and FBI shared the video with the public, they said in anews releasethat it was the \"full raw\" video, and that \"anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage.\"\n\nJim Stafford was one of several video forensic analysts who looked at the video for CBS News using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata. He said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a \"screen capture, not an actual export\" of the raw file.\n\nHe also told CBS News the metadata showed that the video was in fact two separate videos stitched together. It was also slightly sped up, so the video covering 11 hours runs approximately 10 hours and 53 minutes in length.\n\nCBS asked the FBI and Justice Department for a response, but they declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons said they \"had no additional information to provide.\"",
        "source_2": "The \"missing minute\" in surveillance video near Jeffrey Epstein’s cell the night of his death may not be missing at all, according to a new report.\n\nThe revelation comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi said a minute was missing every night from the video surveillance recordings because of a video system reset.\n\nVideo forensic analysts have cast doubt on Bondi’s claims and also noted it appears the footage is not raw as previously claimed by government officials.\n\nThat “missing minute” from the security camera at the Manhattan Metropolitan Correction Center, where Jeffrey Epstein died nearly six years ago, may not be missing at all, as first reported byCBS News. Conspiracies began swirling after the Department of Justice and FBI released nearly 11 hours of surveillance footage earlier this month, since the time code on the video jumped ahead one minute just before midnight.\n\nThe video has raised questions about the missing minute, in which footage shows part of the area near Epstein’s cell where he died by suicide, according to the medical examiner.\n\nDownload the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts™.\n\nA government source familiar with the investigation told CBS News that the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the DOJ inspector general have obtained a copy of the video that does not have the one-minute gap.\n\nStill, the revelation doesn’t answer why the minute was missing in the first place. The FBI said it released raw footage from inside the special housing unit the night of Epstein’s death on Aug. 9, 2019. The surveillance footage came from what officials cited as the only relevant video camera that recorded footage in the unit. Several government officials have identified the video as key evidence that supports the conclusion that Epstein’s death was a suicide.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi was pressed about the gap in coverage earlier this month. She stated the missing minute was because of a nightly reset of the video that led to the recording system missing one recording minute each night and said the information came from the Bureau of Prisons.\n\n“There was a minute that was off that counter and what we learned from (the) Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,” said Bondi. She added the equipment was “from like 1999, so every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute.”\n\nBondi pledged her department would share more video that revealed the same thing occurred every night when the video system reset. However, that video has yet to be released.\n\nVideo forensic professionals told CBS News that a nightly reset is abnormal and was not something they’d experienced with most video systems. The analysts also noted that the recording released by the FBI was edited and not raw, as government officials claimed. Bondi, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and others are on the record publicly saying the video would be released without alterations.\n\nWhen the DOJ and FBI released the footage to the public, they noted in apress releasethat it was the “full raw” recording and “anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein’s cell was located from SHU common area would have been captured on the footage.”\n\nJim Stafford, one of the video forensic analysts who reviewed the video for CBS News, said metadata revealed that the file was first created on May 23 and that it is probably a “screen capture, not an actual export” of the raw recording. He said the metadata shows that the footage was two separate videos spliced together. The footage was also sped up slightly — with the video reportedly running 11 hours, but coming in at a time of 10 hours and 53 minutes.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ declined to comment on the report. The Bureau of Prisons stated they “had no additional information to provide.”\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate finding on Tuesday,The Washington Postreported it texted nearly 1,100 Americans to get their opinions about President Donald Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nThe Post reports that fewer than 2 in 10 Americans approve of the way the president is handling the files, while nearly 6 in 10 disapprove. More than two in 10 had no opinion.\n\nSome expressed the belief that they believe Trump has something to hide by failing to release the files. While some said they didn’t care and others expressed confidence that Trump would eventually release the findings.\n\nMeanwhile, about 1 in 7 Americans (15%) believe Epstein died by suicide. While nearly three times as many (44%) believe he was murdered. Forty-two percent said they were unsure about how he died.\n\nA NEW FINDING REPORTED BY C-B-S NEWS, CITING GOVERNMENT SOURCES, REVEALS THERE IS NO MISSING MINUTE FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE AT THE MANHATTAN METROPOLITAN CORRECTION CENTER WHERE JEFFREY EPSTEIN DIED IN 2019..\n\nWHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND F-B-I RELEASED NEARLY 11 HOURS OF SURVEILLANCE VIDEO EARLIER THIS MONTH– THE TIMECODE ON THE SCREEN JUMPED AHEAD ONE MINUTE JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT.\n\nTHE VIDEO RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MISSING MINUTE. THE FOOTAGE SHOWS PART OF THE AREA NEAR EPSTEIN’S CELL WHERE HE DIED BY SUICIDE, ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER.\n\nA GOVERNMENT SOURCE TELLS C-B-S NEWS THE F-B-I, D-OJ INSPECTOR GENERAL AND BUREAU OF PRISONS OBTAINED A COPY OF THE VIDEO THAT DOESN’T HAVE THE ONE-MINUTE GAP JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE NIGHT EPSTEIN DIED.\n\nSTILL, THE REVELATION DOESN’T CLEAR UP WHY THE MINUTE WAS MISSING TO BEGIN WITH. THE F-B-I SAYS IT HAS RELEASED RAW FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE THE SPECIAL HOUSING UNIT THE NIGHT OF EPSTEIN’S DEATH. THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE CAME FROM WHAT OFFICIALS CITED AS THE ONLY RELEVANT VIDEO CAMERA THAT RECORDED FOOTAGE IN THE UNIT. THE VIDEO HAS BEEN DECLARED BY MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN RULING EPSTEIN’S DEATH A SUICIDE.\n\nEPSTEIN’S DEATH HAS BECOME THE CENTER OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THE MISSING MINUTE IS ADDING TO THE ALLEGED MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE HIGH-PROFILE FINANCIER.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI WAS PRESSED ABOUT THE GAP IN COVERAGE EARLIER THIS MONTH. SHE STATED THE MISSING MINUTE WAS BECAUSE OF A NIGHTLY RESET OF THE VIDEO THAT LED TO THE RECORDING SYSTEM MISSING ONE RECORDING MINUTE EVERY NIGHT.\n\nTHERE WAS A MINUTE THAT WAS OFF THAT COUNTER AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM BUREAU OF PRISONS WAS EVERY YEAR, EVERY NIGHT, THEY REDO THAT VIDEO. IT’S ALL FROM LIKE 1999, SO EVERY NIGHT IS RESET, SO EVERY NIGHT SHOULD HAVE THAT SAME MISSING MINUTE.”\n\nBONDI VOWED HER DEPARTMENT WOULD SHARE MORE VIDEO SHOWING THE SAME THING OCCURRED EVERY NIGHT.  HOWEVER, THAT FOOTAGE HAS YET TO BE RELEASED.\n\nVIDEO FORENSICS ANALYSTS TELL C-B-S NEWS A NIGHTLY RESET IS UNUSUAL AND WAS NOT SOMETHING THEY’D EXPERIENCED WITH MOST VIDEO SYSTEMS. THEY ALSO NOTED, THE FOOTAGE DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE RAW BUT TWO VIDEOS EDITED TOGETHER. BONDI AND THE F-B-I DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAVE CLAIMED THE FOOTAGE IS RAW AND WAS RELEASED WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS. THEY ALSO STATED THE FULL RAW RECORDING WOULD’VE CAPTURED ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE TIER WHERE EPSTEIN’S CELL WAS LOCATED.\n\nONE ANALYST SAYS THE FILE WAS CREATED ON MAY 23RD OF THIS YEAR AND IT IS LIKELY A SCREEN CAPTURE NOT AN ACTUAL EXPORT. HE USED METADATA TO COME TO HIS THEORY. HE ALSO SAYS THE VIDEO APPEARS TO BE SPED-UP SLIGHTLY AND ONLY RUNS A LITTLE UNDER THE 11 HOURS STATED– AT 10 MINUTES 53 SECONDS.\n\nTHE F-B-I AND D-O-J DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE REPORT.\n\nFOR MORE ON THIS STORY– DOWNLOAD THE STRAIGHT ARROW NEWS APP OR VISIT SAN DOT COM.\n\nQuestions regarding the integrity and completeness of surveillance footage from Jeffrey Epstein's cell raise concerns about transparency and trust in the investigation of his death, with public skepticism fueled by unexplained missing video and official statements. Public perception and handling of related evidence continue to shape debate over accountability and institutional reliability.\n\nThe ambiguity surrounding the \"missing minute\" of video and whether the footage was edited or uncut is central to concerns about transparency and the thoroughness of the investigations into Epstein's death.\n\nConflicting official statements and delayed release of explanations contribute to ongoing skepticism regarding the performance and openness of agencies involved in managing Epstein's incarceration and subsequent investigation.\n\nPolling shows notable public doubt about the official narrative of Epstein's death and the handling of related evidence, reflecting broader debates about trust in institutional processes and transparency.",
