        "source_1": "The collapse of the Assad regime has prompted a punishing military response from Israel, which has launched airstrikes at military targetsacross Syria and deployed ground troops both into and beyond a demilitarized buffer zone for the first time in 50 years.\n\nThe Israeli military on Tuesday said it had carried out about 480 strikes across the country over the past two days, hitting most of Syria’s strategic weapon stockpiles, while Defense Minister Israel Katz said the Israeli navy had destroyed the Syrian fleet overnight, hailing the operation as “a great success.”\n\nJust a day earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had hailed the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime as “a new and dramatic chapter.”\n\n“The collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows with which we have struck Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran,” he said during a rare press conference Monday. “The axis has not yet disappeared but as I promised – we are changing the face of the Middle East.”\n\nIsraeli officials have reveled in the downfall of Assad, a staunch ally of Iran who allowed his country to be used as a resupply route for Hezbollah in Lebanon. But they also fear what could come from radical Islamists governing Syria, which borders Israel in the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told journalists on Monday that Israel was bombing Syrian military facilities housing chemical weapons stocks and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling “into the hands of extremists.”\n\n“With regard to what will be in the future, I’m not a prophet,” he said. “It is important right now to take all necessary steps in the context of the security of Israel.”\n\nA CNN team in Damascus heard loud explosions throughout the early hours on Tuesday, a continuation of strikes that began over the weekend. Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group, said the overnight bombing campaign was “the most violent in Damascus in 15 years.”\n\nOf the 480 strikes carried out by the Israeli Air Force, about 350 were manned aircraft strikes targeting airfields, anti-aircraft batteries, missiles, drones, fighter jets, tanks and weapon production sites in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The rest of the strikes were in support of ground operations that targeted weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions.\n\nThe IDF also said its ships struck two Syrian naval facilities, where 15 vessels were docked. Dozens of sea-to-sea missiles were said to have been destroyed.\n\nImages captured by AFP photographers showed large scale destruction of military vessels at the Syrian naval port in Latakia and destroyed Syrian military helicopters at the Mezzeh Air Base southwest of Damascus.\n\nMeanwhile, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab.\n\nThe Arab League, a grouping of Arab nations, said Israel was “taking advantage of the developments in the internal situation in Syria,” and Egypt said its moves “constitute an exploitation of the state of fluidity and vacuum… to occupy more Syrian territories.”\n\nNadav Shoshani, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus, but acknowledged they were operating in Syria beyond the buffer zone. The Israeli military has insisted that it “is not interfering with the internal events in Syria.”\n\nKatz said in a statement on Monday that Israel was creating a “security zone free of heavy strategic weapons and terrorist infrastructures” in southern Syria, “beyond the buffer zone.”\n\nVoice of the Capital said on Tuesday that Israeli forces had advanced as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital and several kilometers beyond the Syrian side of the buffer zone. CNN could not independently confirm that claim, but the village lies in the Syrian foothills of Mount Hermon, which Israeli forces captured on Sunday. Mount Hermon is a strategic high point that sits on the border between Syria, Lebanon, and the Golan Heights.\n\nIsraeli ground forces entered Syrian territory after Netanyahu on Sunday ordered the military to seize that demilitarized “area of separation” between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. That zone was established in 1974, after Israeli forces – responding to a Syrian attack – captured the Golan Heights in 1967. Israel annexed the territory in 1981, but it is still considered to be occupied Syria under international law.\n\nIsraeli officials have refused to give details on how far Israeli forces will advance, or how long they will stay there. Danny Dannon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council in a letter on Monday that his country had “deployed temporarily in few points.” He said they were “limited and temporary measures to counter any further threat to its citizens.”\n\nEyad Kourdi and Dana Karni contributed to this report.",

our actions are solely focused on safeguarding our security,” he wrote in a letter to the 15-member council, adding that Israel remained committed to the framework of a 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement.\n\nتغطية صحفية: لحظة شن طائرات الاحتلال غارات على مدينة درعا السورية ومحيطهاpic.twitter.com/udYN2eUDco\n\nThe United States was also taking advantage of the new reality in Syria, carrying out dozens of strikes on Islamic State targets in central Syria on Sunday.\n\nAmerican warplanes struck more than 75 Islamic State targets hitting the group’s leaders, operatives and camps, the US military said.\n\nThe Syrian government fell early Sunday in a stunning end to the 50-year rule of the Assad family, after a sudden rebel offensive sprinted across government-held territory and entered the capital in 10 days.\n\nSyria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad’s rule, dragged in major outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world, and sent millions of refugees into neighboring states.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest rebel group, is the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria regarded by the US and others as a terrorist organization, and many Syrians remain fearful it will impose draconian Islamist rule.\n\nHTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has tried to reassure minorities that he will not interfere with them and the international community that he opposes Islamist attacks abroad. In Aleppo, which the rebels captured a week ago, there have not been reports of reprisals.\n\nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

        "source_3": "The Israel Defense Forces has conducted 300 strikes in Syria since Sunday’s ouster of Bashar Assad, Israeli media reported on Tuesday, marking the heaviest air campaign in the country since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nIsrael’sYnetnews outlet cited Western intelligence sources late Monday night as confirming the figure, saying that the aerial assault is mainly targeting air force bases, including entire squadrons of fighter jets.\n\nIt is believed that the Syrian Air Force could be destroyed in its entirety “within a few days,”Ynetnoted, which would substantially reduce the threat posed to the Jewish state by the incoming Syrian government.\n\nThe last time Israel destroyed an entire air force was in 1967, when the Egyptian Air Force was wiped out in the first hours of the Six-Day War.\n\nLocal security sources toldReuterson Monday that the Israeli Air Force had attacked at least three army bases that housed dozens of helicopters and jets in the largest wave of strikes on the Syrian Air Force since Assad was toppled.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor with links to the Syrian opposition, was cited byAFPas confirming that Israel carried out more than 100 strikes on Monday, including on a suspectedchemical weaponsproduction site. The IDF did not immediately comment on the strikes.\n\nEarly on Tuesday morning,AFPandAl Jazeerareported loud blasts in Damascus, with the latter outlet attributing the explosions to Israel.\n\nOn Sunday, Syrian President Bashar Assadfled Damascusas a coalition of rebel groups stormed the capital, ending his family’s five-decade rule.\n\n“The tyrant Bashar Assad has been overthrown,” a rebel spokesperson declared in a statement carried on state television on Sunday morning.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli Foreign MinisterGideon Sa’arconfirmed that the IAF had struck sites used to produce chemical weapons and long-range missiles in an attempt to prevent them from falling into hostile hands.\n\n“We attacked strategic weapons systems, like for example remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists,” Sa’ar told theAssociated Press.\n\n“The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,” he reiterated in his remarks to the wire agency. The top diplomat did not provide details about when or where the airstrikes were conducted.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said earlier on Monday morning that he had ordered the continued destruction by the IDF of strategic weapons that were previously held by the Syrian regime and Iranian-backed militias, to prevent their falling into the hands of terrorist groups.\n\nAmong the arms taken out by the IDF were “surface-to-air missiles, air defense systems, surface-to-surface missiles, cruise missiles, long-range rockets and coast-to-sea missiles,” the Defense Ministry stated.\n\nKatz has also ordered the military to set up a secure area free of strategic weapons and terror infrastructure inside Syrian territory, beyond the buffer zone on the Israel-Syria border. The 210th “Bashan” Division began proactive operations on Sunday to ensure “the protection of the residents of the Golan Heights in light of the internal events in Syria,” the IDF said.\n\nKatz said he had also instructed the military to establish full control over the once-demilitarizedbuffer zonein the Golan, which was established under the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Damascus and Jerusalem that ended the Yom Kippur War.\n\nAccording to Lebanon’sAl Mayadeenoutlet, which is closely affiliated with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror organization, IDF tanks have reached positions 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the town of Qatana, which is located some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the outskirts of Damascus.\n\nThree security sources, one in Syria and two in the region, confirmed the report, tellingReuterson Tuesday that IDF soldiers had reached Qatana.\n\nAn IDF spokespersondeniedthe reports later on Tuesday, tellingReutersthat Israeli ground forces “have not left the buffer zone.”\n\nJerusalem reportedly informed the United States that its activities in Syria constitute “temporary and tactical operations” to protect civilians in its north. A U.S. government source signaled Washington’s approval for the move in a conversation with Israel’sKan Newsbroadcaster, saying that “no nation can tolerate terror groups on its doorstep.”\n\n“Since the Syrian army abandoned its positions in and around the Israeli-Syrian buffer zone, Israel has declared that Syria’s enforcement of the 1974 ceasefire agreement has collapsed. Israel has taken temporary measures to stabilize the buffer zone and prevent an invasion of Israeli territory,” the American source told the Israeli public broadcaster.\n\n“We hope that, in the future, we will see the area return to stability,” added the source.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the details of the conversations toldKan Newsthat Jerusalem had informed the Biden administration of its intention to take control of the Syrian part of Mount Hermon and the buffer zones. Washington has not expressed public opposition to the moves."
