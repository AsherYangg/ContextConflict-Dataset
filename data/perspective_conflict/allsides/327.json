        "source_1": "HONG KONG —ChinaandCanadamoved swiftly on Tuesday to retaliate against newly imposed U.S. tariffs, announcing their own levies on U.S. goods that could further disrupt the United States’ trade with its top three trading partners.\n\nA 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.\n\nChina will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both “tariff and nontariff measures.”\n\nThe new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.\n\nChina says that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.\n\n“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\n“Pressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.”\n\nLin also said that China had “taken strong measures” to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which PresidentDonald Trumphas cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the United States was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.\n\nIn addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its “unreliable entity” list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.\n\nBeijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.\n\nThe combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by President Joe Biden.\n\nCanada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in U.S. goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.\n\nTariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeausaid in a statementlate Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.\n\n“Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,” Trudeau said. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”\n\nTrump, who had beenthreatening tariffs against Canada and Mexicosince November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.\n\nWhile precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid that is then smuggled into the United States, Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.\n\nAccording to U.S. customs data,only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanylseized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.\n\nTrudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in a further drop of 97% in fentanyl seizures from Canada from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.\n\nThe tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed Feb. 1, had beenput on hold for 30 daysafter the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.\n\nU.S. stocks tumbledMonday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with theDow Jones Industrial Averagefalling 650 points, or 1.48%, and theS&P 500dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.\n\nIn Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%,CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.\n\nChinese leaders and lawmakers gather in Beijing this week for the country’sbiggest political event of the year, the National People’s Congress, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party will signal its priorities and goals for the year, including its approach to the Trump administration.\n\nThough China spared U.S. agriculture inits response to the first 10% tariff, “Trump’s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus” and the U.S. farming sector “should start to feel the pinch,” said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.\n\n“Sounds like it’s telling the U.S. that ‘we’re really going to hit you hard if you don’t stop,’” he said in an email.\n\nIn Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday on NBC’s “Meet the Press NOW” that Canada would “respond like they’ve never seen before.”\n\nHe said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the United States, as well as shipments of nickel, which “will shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.”\n\n“I’m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,” Ford said. “I apologize, but he’s giving us no choice.”\n\nJennifer Jett is the Asia Digital Editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.\n\nPeter Guo is a fellow on NBC’s Asia Desk, based in Hong Kong.",

        "source_3": "The Claman Countdown panelists Kenny Polcari and Simeon Hyman analyze how the markets will respond to a tariff on Canada and Mexico.\n\nPresidentDonald Trump'snew tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico took effect at midnight Tuesday morning, increasing the taxes that U.S. importers will pay on certain goods when they enter the country.\n\nEffective Tuesday, U.S. imports from China, the third-largest U.S. trading partner, will be subject to a new 10% tariff on top of the initial 10% tariff he imposed on Chinese goods last month.\n\nTariffs on imported goodsfrom Canada and Mexico – America's two largest bilateral trading partners, according to Census Bureau data – are also set to rise, with 25% tariffs levied on all imports from the two countries. The tariffs include a carve-out for a lower 10% tariff on Canadian oil imports.\n\nPresident Trump was asked on Monday whether there was room left for any room left for Canada or Mexico to make a deal to avoid tariffs and he replied, \"No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow.\"\n\nWARREN BUFFETT SAYS TARIFFS ARE AN ECONOMIC 'ACT OF WAR': 'TOOTH FAIRY DOESN'T PAY 'EM'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports took effect Tuesday, as did an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nShortly after taking office in January, Trump announced he would impose tariffs on the three countries and cited the flows of illegal fentanyl shipments across the Mexican and Canadian borders, as well as precursor chemicals for fentanyl shipped from China. He cited authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nWhile theChina tariffswere implemented on schedule, the president delayed the Canada and Mexico tariffs for a month after the two countries announced border security measures.\n\n\"Just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10%, so it's 10 plus 10. And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that's a very important thing to say,\" Trump said during Monday's press conference.\n\nWHO GETS STUCK WITH THE BILL FOR TARIFFS ON IMPORTED CANADIAN OIL?\n\nU.S. agricultural products will face retaliatory tariffs imposed by America's trading partners.(Ben Brewer/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nU.S. trading partners have already signaled they will retaliate through their own tariffs on American exports, as well as potential non-tariff trade barriers that would be aimed at U.S. firms.\n\nCanada announced that it will impose a 25% tariff on a wide variety of American exports, including machinery, auto parts, apparel products, alcohol and tobacco, sports equipment, plastic products, construction materials, lumber, agricultural products, appliances, furniture, chemicals and more.\n\nIt also plans additional tariffs on other U.S.-made products that are expected to includecars, trucks, buses, electric vehicles (EVs), recreational vehicles, steel and aluminum products, fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.\n\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY WITH BIGGEST MONTHLY DROP IN NEARLY 4 YEARS\n\nThe U.S. auto industry is expected to face retaliatory tariffs for auto parts and potentially finished vehicles.(Photographer: Emily Elconin/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nMexico's governmentsignaled in February that it is planning retaliatory tariffs it would implement if Trump imposed tariffs on Mexico, though it didn't specify those measures at the time. A report by Reuters citing sources familiar with the matter suggested the potential tariffs could range from 5% to 20% on U.S. pork, cheese, produce, and manufactured steel and aluminum.\n\nChina retaliated against the initial tariffs by imposing 15% tariffs onU.S. energy exports, including coal, natural gas and petroleum; as well as 10% tariffs on manufactured goods, including trucks and agricultural machinery, a Brookings Institution analysis noted.\n\nThe newly imposed tariffs are expected to elicit more retaliation from China, as the AP reported that the Chinese government is eyeing tariffs on U.S.agricultural exports and food productsas targets.\n\nAnanalysis by the Tax Foundationfound that the tariffs imposed on imports from China would reduce long-run GDP by 0.1%, while the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods would deal a bigger blow to economic output, reducing GDP by 0.3%. Those figures are before accounting for retaliation by those countries against American products.\n\nThe Tax Foundation's analysis noted that the U.S. imported $292 billion of non-energy products from Canada in 2024, as well as $120 billion in energy products. Imports from Mexico totaled $504 billion last year, while those from China totaled $430 billion plus additional imports shipped using the \"de minimis\" loophole.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
