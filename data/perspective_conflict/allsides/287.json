        "source_1": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is prohibited by the Constitution under the 22nd Amendment, saying in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarifying that he was “not joking.”\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a Sunday-morning phone call with NBC News, referring to his allies. “But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.”\n\n“I’m focused on the current,” Trump added, in some of his most extensive comments to date about serving a third term.\n\nWhen asked whether he wanted another term, the president responded, “I like working.”\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump said, when asked to clarify. “But I’m not — it is far too early to think about it.”\n\nWhen asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.”\n\nNBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method.\n\nAsked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nAmending the Constitution to abolish thetwo-term limitwould be exceedingly difficult, requiring either a two-thirds vote of Congress or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose changes. Either route would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.\n\nThe president pointed to his poll numbers, saying that “a lot of people would like me to” hold office for a third term.\n\nTrump has previously commented on running for a third term in office, though Republicans have seen thesecomments as jokesor the president trolling his critics.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., crafted a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits, which would allow Trump to seek another term in office.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump ally Steve Bannon said in an interviewon News Nationthat he believes Trump will “run and win again in 2028.” Bannon said in the same interview that he thought “we’ll have a couple of alternatives” in determining how Trump could seek a third term despite the two-term maximum for holding the presidency.\n\nThe White House has amplified Trump’s comments likening himself to royalty, posting a picture of a fake magazine cover depicting the president with a crown after the administration shot down congestion pricing in New York City.\n\nThe White House’s post to X quoted Trump’s previous comments on Truth Social: “LONG LIVE THE KING!”\n\nKristen Welker is the moderator of \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresidentDonald Trumphas said that he has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term, even though that is prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNewsweeksought email comment from the office of Attorney GeneralPam Bondion Monday.\n\nA legal expert toldNewsweekthere are a number of routes that Trump could take to legally take a third term. He could become the first U.S. president to serve a third term since the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951. That set a two-term limit on all U.S. presidents.\n\nIn a phone interview withNBCNews on March 30, Trump said there were methodsthat would allow him to serve a third termand added that he was \"not joking.\"\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it. But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know; it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nAsked if wanted a third term, Trump replied: \"I like working.\"\n\n\"I'm not joking. But I'm not—it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\n\"There are methods [by] which you could do it,\" he later added.\n\nStephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University,toldNewsweekthat there are a number of methods by whichTrump could seek another term, using the assistance of Vice PresidentJD Vance.\n\n\"Trump can be nominated as vice president with Vance nominated to be president, Gillers said. \"If the Vance-Trump ticket wins, Vance resigns and Trump becomes president. He then chooses Vance to be his vice president. TheSenatewould have to confirm Vance,\" he added.\n\n\"There is one possible problem with this tactic. The last sentence of the 12th amendment says: 'But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of vice president of the United States,'\" Gillers said.\n\n\"However, it was written long before the 22nd amendment's two-term limit and probably refers to [minimum] age, 35 years old, and citizenship, naturally born in the U.S., which were and are the constitutional eligibility requirements.\n\n\"Further, the 22nd amendment prohibits Trump from 'being elected' president more than twice. But in this sequence, Trump is not being 'elected' president, but vice president.\"\n\n\"The second workaround is this: Vance runs for president and someone else is on the ticket for vice president, maybe Don Jr. They win. Don Jr. quits and Vance picks Trump to be vice president with Senate confirmation,\" Gillers said.\n\n\"So Trump is not 'elected' to anything, not even vice president. Then Vance quits, Trump becomes president, though not through election. He chooses Vance as his vice president with Senate confirmation.\"\n\nGillers stressed that he is \"just identifying these paths, not endorsing them.\"\n\nTrump could seek to change the U.S. Constitution's ban on a third presidential term.\n\nAccording to theOffice of the Federal Register, \"an amendment may be proposed either by theCongresswith a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani toldNewsweek: \"Politically, Trump doesn't have the votes to repeal the 22nd Amendment, either in Congress or the states.\"\n\nTrump said in his NBC interview that he is focused on his current presidential term and that it is too early to decide if he will seek a third term.\n\nHowever, he was familiar with the method by which Vance could be elected president and resign to make way for Trump.\n\nTrump will likely consider several options, and gauge public opinion, before deciding whether to seek another term.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSean O'Driscoll is a Newsweek Senior Crime and Courts Reporter based in Ireland.

        "source_3": "President Donald Trump revealed he’s “not joking” about running for a third term during a Sunday phone call with NBC News’s Kristen Welker.\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump reportedlytoldWelker, vaguely referring to allies. “But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go. You know, it’s very early in the administration.”\n\n“I’m focused on the current,” the president continued.\n\n“I’m not joking,”Trumpclarified. “But I’m not — it is far too early to think about it.”\n\n“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump added, responding to a question on if he has embraced plans to seekreelectionfor a third term. Seeking a third term, however, is prohibited by the 22nd Amendment of theConstitution.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” the amendmentstates.\n\nTrump was also reportedly asked if it was possibleVice President JD Vancewouldrunfor president and later pass the role onto Trump, to which Trump said, “That’s one” method.(RELATED: ‘Heir Apparent’: Here’s How JD Vance’s New RNC Role Puts Him In Pole Position For 2028)\n\n“But there are others, too,” the president reportedly added without elaboration.\n\nTrump has previously made severalremarksabout running for office again.\n\n“I’ve raised a lot of money for the next race that I assume I can’t use for myself, but I’m not 100% sure,” hesaidto House Republicans days after emerging victorious in the 2024 general election. “I think I’m not allowed to run again.”\n\nDemocratic New YorkRep.Dan Goldmanannouncedin November 2024 a “resolution which would re-affirm that the 22nd Amendment is explicit in prohibiting Presidents who have served two full terms from running for the Presidency again.”\n\nGoldman wanted to further “condemn [then-] President-Elect Donald Trump’s frequent statements suggesting he could serve past the end of his most recent term.”\n\nGoldmanalso included an example of Trump’s comments in the announcement, quoting the president’ saying, “I suspect I won’t be running again unless you say, ‘He’s so good we’ve got to figure something else out.'”\n\n“The Constitution is clear that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and any attempt for Donald Trump to circumvent the 22nd Amendment is blatantly unconstitutional. I call on all of my colleagues – Democrat and Republican alike – to stand by the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and confirm the Congress’ commitment to this principle,” Goldman said in the statement."
