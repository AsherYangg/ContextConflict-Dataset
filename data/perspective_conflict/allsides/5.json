    "question": "How might the open letter from 550 former Israeli security officials urging President Donald Trump to push for an end to the Gaza war, and asserting Hamas is no longer a strategic threat, shape Israel’s military objectives, hostage negotiations, and international pressure on Netanyahu’s plans?",

        "source_1": "Ami Ayalon says his desire to end the war in Gaza is both professional and personal.\n\nAyalon — the former head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency — has signedan open letter on behalf of 550 former Israeli security officialscalling for an end to Israel's military campaign in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the signatories, Ayalon says Israel long ago achieved its stated military goal of dismantling Hamas, and must now strike a deal to bring its remaining hostages home.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of himself, he says his country also has a moral imperative to end the suffering of Gazans.\n\n\"We wrote the letter as a result of the way we understand the war, and not because of the moral point of view,\" Ayalon, a former Labor Party lawmaker and Israeli navy commander-in-chief, toldAs It Happensguest host Rebecca Zandbergen.\n\n\"But I'm telling you the truth. Personally, I am ashamed of what we are doing in Gaza.\"\n\nThe letter, shared on social media and addressed to the U.S. President Donald Trump, is from an organization called Commanders for Israel's Security.\n\n\"It is our professional judgment that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel, and our experience tells us Israel has all it takes to deal with its residual terror capabilities, remotely or otherwise,\" it reads.\n\nIt was signed by Ayalon, former chief of the Mossad intelligence agency Tamir Pardo, former Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) chief Matan Vilnai, former Israeli ambassador Jeremy Issacharoff and former Israeli police commissioner Assaf Hefetz.\n\nAyalon says the only path to security for Israel now is to pursue a two-state solution with Palestinians.\n\n\"If we really want to defeat Hamas, we have to defeat its ideology and the only way is to present a better ideology,\" he said. \"And the only better ideology is to present the political horizon, which is a state alongside Israel.\"\n\nThe letter comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increased pressure, both at home and abroad, to cease hostilities in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment from CBC, but the prime minister is reportedlypushing for a full takeover of the Gaza Stripagainst the urging of his own military chief, according to a Reuters report that cites three confidential Israeli officials.\n\nIsrael expanding Gaza operations risks 'catastrophic consequences,' UN official says\n\nIn a recent social media videoalongside Ayalon, Yoram Cohen, also a former head of Shin Bet, called Netanyahu's objectives \"a fantasy.\"\n\n\"If anyone imagines that we can reach every terrorist and every pit and every weapon and in parallel bring our hostages home, I think it is impossible,\" he said.\n\nAyalon says he believes Netanyahu, who heads a right-wing coalition government, is motivated by solely by a desire to cling to power.\n\n\"The idea is to maintain his coalition and to make sure that this war will not end because the moment that this war will end, he is losing his coalition,\" Ayalon said.\n\nBut the letter is not addressed to Netanyahu; it's addressed to Trump.\n\n\"It is a regional crisis with an impact on the international community, and we believe that the international community should interfere,\" Ayalon said.\n\n\"I'm not a psychologist and I don't want to pretend to understand the behaviour of Donald Trump. But the way I understand it, he was elected in order to end wars and not to start wars.\"\n\nPressed by reporters earlier this week, Trump declined to say whether the U.S., Israel's closest military ally, supported Netanyahu's plans to occupy Gaza.\n\n\"I know that we are there now trying to get people fed,\" Trump said. As far as the rest of it, I really can't say. That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.\"\n\nAsked for comment on the letter, the U.S. State Department pointed CBC toSecretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks in a July 21 interview on Fox Newswith Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n\"We're optimistic and hopeful that any day now we will have a ceasefire agreement,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians over the last two years, according to Palestinian health authorities, and razed huge swaths of Gaza to the ground.\n\nThe military campaign in Gaza is retaliation for Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 251.\n\nMost of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Of the 50 still held in Gaza, around 20 are believed to be alive.\n\nHuman rights organizations, includingAmnesty International,B'TselemandPhysicians for Human Rights Israel, have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, something Israel fiercely denies. The International Court of Justice is pursuing a genocide case against the country, brought forward by South Africa.\n\nMore recently, aid groups,including Human Rights Watch, have accused Israel of intentionally starving Gazans by blocking aid andshooting Palestinians who are lining up for food.\n\nLate last month, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, which monitors hunger around the world,issued a famine alert for the Palestinian enclave.\n\nSome 188 Palestinians, including 94 children, have died from hunger since the war began, according to Gaza authorities, many of them in recent weeks.\n\nIsrael denies using forced starvation against Gazans and has repeatedly claimed,without evidence, that Hamas is stealing food.\n\nLast month, Salma Altaweel, a mother of four in Gaza,told CBCshe doesn't have \"even one gram of flour\" in her home, and her children keep asking why kids in other parts of the world can have all the food they want while they starve.\n\n\"I know parents that are not able to feed their kids for many days. One lady told me that she ties the stomachs of her kids at night to make them sleep. Others are trying to eat anything, things that we were not able to eat, like the leaves of the trees,\" she said.\n\n\"Other people are falling, literally, they are falling in the streets.\"\n\nWith files from The Associated Press.

        "source_2": "A group of some 600 retired Israeli security officials, including former heads of intelligence agencies, have written to US President Donald Trump to pressure Israel to immediately end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,\" the officials said.\n\n\"Your credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: End the war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,\" they wrote.\n\nTheir appeal comes amid reports that Netanyahu is pushing to expand military operations in Gaza as indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas have stalled.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating war in Gaza following Hamas's attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken into Gaza as hostages.\n\nMore than 60,000 people have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nOn Monday, the ministry reported that at least 94 people had been killed in Gaza in the past day, including dozens it said had died in Israeli strikes.\n\nAt least 24 people had been killed while seeking aid, it added. Such reports have become almost daily in recent months but are hard to verify as international journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently.\n\nThe territory is also experiencing mass deprivation as a result of heavy restrictions imposed by Israel on what is allowed into Gaza. The ministry says 180 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition since the start of the war.\n\nUN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza.\n\nThe latest intervention by the top former Israeli officials came after videos of two emaciated Israeli hostages were released by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants.\n\nThe videos were widely condemned by Israeli and Western leaders.\n\nAfter the videos were released, Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".\n\nBut an Israeli official - widely quoted by local media - said Netanyahu was working to free the hostages through \"the military defeat of Hamas\".\n\nThe possibility of a new escalation in Gaza may further anger Israel's allies which have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire as reports of Palestinians dying from starvation or malnutrition cause shock around the world.\n\nThe main group supporting hostages' families condemned the idea of a new military offensive saying: \"Netanyahu is leading Israel and the hostages to doom.\"\n\nThat view was pointedly made in the letter to Trump by former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, Ami Ayalon, former chief of Shin Bet - Israel's domestic secret service agency - former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and former Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon among others.\n\n\"At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,\" said Ayalon.\n\nThe former top leaders head the Commanders for Israel's Security (CIS) group, which has urged the government in the past to focus on securing the return of the hostages.\n\n\"Stop the Gaza War! On behalf of CIS, Israel's largest group of former IDF generals and Mossad, Shin Bet, Police, and Diplomatic Corps equivalents, we urge you to end the Gaza war. You did it in Lebanon. Time to do it in Gaza as well,\" they wrote to the US president.\n\nIsrael has faced growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.\n\nPolls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on Western leaders to act.\n\nBut it is not clear what pressure, if any, Trump will choose to exert on the Israeli prime minister.\n\nThe US president has consistently backed his ally, even though he publicly acknowledged last week that there was \"real starvation\" in Gaza after Netanyahu insisted there was no such thing.\n\nIsrael said it targeted well known reporter Anas al-Sharif and alleged he was part of Hamas, which Al Jazeera has denied.\n\nIt follows similar moves by the UK, France and Canada.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".\n\nProtesters call for the release of hostages still being held in Gaza as they voice support for Israel.",
        "source_3": "The Israel Defense Forces’ top commander is pushing back against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan forfull military control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring a tense, three-hour meeting Tuesday night, IDF chief of staff Eyal Zamir warned the premier that occupying Gaza would only threatenthe lives of the remaining hostages and his soldiers, three Israeli officials briefed on the meeting told Reuters.\n\nDespite pushback from current and former Israeli security officials, Netanyahu has maintained that military pressure is the only way to free the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza and finish Hamas off for good.\n\nThe Jewish state currently controls about 75% of the Gaza Strip, with Netanyahu preparing to order the IDF to launch a full-scale invasion of the remaining territory to pressure Hamas to accepta cease-fire, according to Israeli media.\n\nThe call was made without Zamir’s input, withthe Jerusalem Post reportingthat an internal memo was sent out Monday calling on the chief of staff to fall in line or resign.\n\nThe IDF had previously rejected a takeover plan, warning Israeli leadership that a full occupation of Gaza — requiring a military presence in crowded civilian areas and the few cities spared from the fighting — would lead to years of sifting through the population to smoke out Hamas’ remaining cells.\n\nThe hostages, no more than 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, are thought to be held in the few areas of Gaza untouched by the conflict, including the city of Deir al-Balah.\n\nFamilies of the captives fear any military action would put their loved ones in grave danger after Hamas reportedly put out an order to execute the hostages if Israeli soldiers are spotted nearby.\n\nZamir’s opposition has been echoed by 19 former top Israeli military, intelligence and police officials, who also objected to the plan and accused Netanyahu of trying to appease members of his far-right coalition, some of whom had threatened to topple the government if the war doesn’t escalate.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid also spoke with Netanyahu on Wednesday, warning the premier that he would face severe backlash at home if a full military takeover of Gaza goes ahead.\n\nIsrael has also faced condemnation abroad over the plan, with the United Nations calling the takeover prospect “deeply alarming.”\n\nNetanyahu’s push for full military pressure came after Hamas published videos last week of twoemaciated hostagessuffering inside the terror group’s vast, underground tunnel network.\n\nThe haunting images renewed calls to end the war, which was started by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel."
