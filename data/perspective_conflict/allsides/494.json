The drop was especially pronounced in the Western Balkans and Central Mediterranean.\n\nIn the US, the number of migrants stopped at the border with Mexico areat their lowest levelsince 2020.\n\nThe trends reflect a global political movement â across the ideological spectrum â to curb illegal immigration.\n\nMigration has dominated European politics for months: Germany implementednew border checks, Italy beganshipping migrantsto Albania, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen madeborder patrol staffinga priority for her new term. Governments taking a tougher stance on the issue âall face pressure from far-right parties that arelaser-focused on migrationâ or have recently lost elections to them,â Politico wrote. The shifts in posture mean that Hungaryâs populist leader Viktor OrbÃ¡n, who has long called for staunch crackdowns, is no longer an outlier in this regard, The Guardian wrote: âTheOrbÃ¡nisation of European migration policyis well under way.â\n\nImmigration is atop voter priorityin the US election, even as it has declined this year. Republican Donald Trump has sought to portray Vice President Kamala Harris as a failed âborder czar,â leaning into âfearmongering, falsehoods and stereotypes,â The Washington Post wrote. Harris, meanwhile, has blasted Trump for opposing a bipartisan bill to boost border security.Unprecedented cooperationbetween the US and Mexico has been central to the decline, The Wall Street Journal wrote: Mexico added patrols and security checkpoints, and the US has disqualified migrants from gaining asylum if they enter illegally. âNot that Democrats are going to win on this issue, but that chaos at the border wonât be on the front pages anymore,â the head of an immigration think tank said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.",
        "source_2": "After reaching a record high at the end of 2023, the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol encounters with migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico has plummeted so far in 2024.\n\nThe Border Patrol recorded 58,038 encounters with migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in August, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of thelatest available government statistics. That was a 77% decline from 249,741 encounters in December 2023, the most ever recorded in a single month.\n\nThis Pew Research Center analysis examines migration patterns at the U.S.-Mexico border usingcurrentandhistorical datafrom U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency that includes the U.S. Border Patrol. The analysis is based on a metric known as migrant encounters.\n\nThe term “encounters”can refer to different types of events. In this analysis, it refers to Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants who cross into the United States without authorization. These migrants are taken into custody, at least temporarily, to await a decision on whether they can remain in the U.S. legally, such as by being granted asylum. Migrants who are not granted asylum are typically deported.\n\nIt is important to note that encounters refer to events, not people, and that some migrants are encountered more than once. As a result, the overall number of encounters is higher than the number of distinct individuals involved.\n\nThis analysis is limited to monthly encountersbetweenports of entry involving the Border Patrol. It excludes encountersatports of entry involving the Office of Field Operations, a federal law enforcement agency within Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPublic opinion data in this analysis comes from Center surveys conducted inJanuary 2024andAugust 2024. Methodological information about these surveys, including their field dates and sample sizes, is available by following the links in the text.\n\nThe decline in encounters has come amidpolicy changes on both sides of the border. Authorities in Mexico havestepped up enforcementto prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. border. And U.S. President Joe Bidenissued an executive order in Junethat makes it much more difficult for migrants who enter the U.S. without legal permission to seek asylum and remain in the country.\n\nThe term “encounters”can refer to different types of events.

These migrants are taken into custody, at least temporarily, to await a decision on whether they can remain in the U.S. legally, such as by being granted asylum. Migrants who are not granted asylum are typically deported.\n\nThe dramatic increase in migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border at the end of 2023 drew widespread criticism from the American public about the government’s handling of the situation,according to a Center survey conducted in early 2024. At the time, 78% of U.S. adults said the large number of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico was either a crisis or a major problem. A similar share (80%) said the U.S. government was doing a bad job dealing with the situation.\n\nSince the end of 2023, however, the monthly number of encounters has declined sharply, including large decreases in encounters with citizens of Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These nations have been among the most common origin countries for migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years.\n\nThere have also been sharp decreases in encounters with citizens of other countries, including some that historically havenotbeen common origin nations for migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn August, 69% of encounters involved migrants from Mexico or the Northern Triangle region. That was a shift from December 2023, when only 46% did.\n\nThe majority of encounters continue to involve single adults. In August, 62% of all encounters involved single adults, while 27% involved people traveling in families and 11% involved unaccompanied minors. In December 2023, a slightly smaller share of encounters (54%) involved single adults, while 41% involved people traveling in families and 5% involved unaccompanied minors.\n\nDespite the large decrease in migrant encounters this year, border security remains a key issue in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, according to aCenter survey fielded in August.\n\nIn fact, 88% of registered voters strongly or somewhat favor improving security along the country’s borders. That includes 96% of voters who support former President Donald Trump and 80% of voters who support Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on March 15, 2021.\n\nJohn Gramlichis an associate director at Pew Research Center.",
        "source_3": "Illegal migrants continue to flood into the U.S. despite a recent decline in border crossings due to the prevalence of alternative modes of entry under the Biden-Harris administration, masquerading the true scope of the border crisis.\n\nThe number of recorded illegal border crossings has dropped significantly in the past few months following an executive order from President Joe Biden capping border entries, the most recent Customs and Border Protection (CBP)data show. Despite the apparent easing, illegal migrants have continued to enter the U.S. through other means, such as the CBP One app and the CHNV program.(RELATED: Sex Trafficking Of Migrant Girls Has Exploded Under Biden-Harris Admin, Human Trafficking Expert Says)\n\n“A lot of people are saying migration has halted. I dare say this is not the case,” stated Enrique Valenzuela, head of the Chihuahua Population Council,according toBorder Report. “Here on this border, we find ourselves at somewhat of an impasse, where it would appear the flow of people stopped.”\n\n“But we see there is more interest in coming in through CBP One,” Valenzuela continued, referencing an app that allows a large number of foreign nationals to apply for asylum daily. “We know because people come to us seeking help with the application.”\n\nMEXICO CITY, MEXICO – JANUARY 09: U.S. President Joe Biden and President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador shake hands during a welcome ceremony as part of the ‘2023 North American Leaders’ Summit at Palacio Nacional on January 09, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/Getty Images)\n\nThe CBP One app was first established in October 2020, with the Biden-Harris administrationexpanding its usein January 2023. The app enables migrants to schedule appointments in order to obtain exemptions at ports of entry, and permits them to submit biometric data to federal immigration authorities in order to apply for travel authorization and obtain parole.\n\nMore than 800,000 foreign nationals scheduled appointments through the CBP One app from January 2023 through the end of August 2024,according toCBP. The number of those being allowed in via the app almost rivals the number of Border Patrol encounters, with roughly 58,000 migrant apprehensions in August and 44,700 processed via the app that same month.\n\n“All those people who make appointments with the CBP One app have no right to be in the United States,” Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, stated to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Biden-Harris administration has decided to allow in 1,400 of those people per day make those appointments.”\n\n“And we know from congressional disclosures that 95.8% of everybody who uses the app ends up getting released into the country on parole and they’re placed into removal proceedings,” Arthur continued. “If you’re placed into removal proceedings with a Notice to Appear, you’re here illegally. That is the allegation that the government is making — you are removable from the United States.”\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has also flown in more thanhalf a million foreign nationalsinto the country via an initiative known as CHNV — a program that grants two-year parole to Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan nationals. The White Houseannouncedin October that those enrolled in the CHNV program, which has been plagued with widespread fraud, would not have their parole renewed.\n\nRoughly30,000 migrantswere being flown into the U.S. a month via the CHNV parole program.\n\nWhile these migrant initiatives have been taking place, the Biden-Harris administration has been enforcing an executive order first enacted in June thatcaps the numberof daily unlawful encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy appears to be keeping illegal border crossings down, with monthly Border Patrol encounters in September reaching their lowest levels since President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris entered office, according to CBP data.\n\nHouse Homeland Committee Chairman Mark Green, a frequent critic of the White House’s border policies, has referred to the CHNV program and the CBP One app as a “massive shell game” that has allowed the administration to tout lower border crossings while the number of otherwise inadmissible migrants entering the U.S. explodes.\n\nThe Mexican government, in the meantime, has been moreardently cracking downon U.S.-bound illegal migration through its country. However, critics remain skeptical of how long Mexican officials will continue to keep many of these migrants at bay.\n\nTodd Bensman, also of the Center for Immigration Studies, filmeda large groupof migrants in the southern Mexico city of Tapachula on Monday. He suggested that they are being kept away from the U.S. border for now, but may be making their way north after the election.\n\n“Biden-Harris did THIS for election optics, in December got Mexico to haul thousands of immigrants here in Tapachula and sardine-can trap them to claim low US crossings and keep them off US media during the campaign,” Bensman stated. “Been here five times and never seen so many as this. Stay tuned.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
