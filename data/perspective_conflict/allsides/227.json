Changing the US Constitution to allow a third presidential term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. An amendment would also need ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US states, another slim possibility.",
        "source_2": "The Trump Store, which is the official retail site of the Trump Organization, is selling a “Trump 2028” ballcap—just weeks after President Donald Trump told NBC News he is “not joking” about the possibility of running for a third term, which is not allowed under the Constitution.\n\nThe red, “Make America Great Again”-esque hats are selling for $50 on the Trump Sore website, and the product description reads: “Make a statement with this Made in America Trump 2028 hat.”\n\nThe hats’ description does not have any direct indication whether they’re meant to support a third term for Donald Trump, or have some other meaning, like the candidacy of one of his family members.\n\nEric Trump, one of the president’s sons and vice president of the Trump Organization, posted an Instagram story Thursday morning wearing the hat and linking to the website.\n\nTrump, who is serving his second term as president, hasnot ruled outthe possibility of running for a third term, saying “there are methods” that can make it possible, despite the Constitution saying no one can serve more than two terms as president.\n\nThe White House referred Forbes to the Trump Organization when asked to comment, and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts:We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.”\n\nOn March 30, Trump told NBC News, “I’m not joking. I’m not joking,” though he added: “It is far too early to think about it.” In the same interview, he said, “A lot of people want me to do it … But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.” The following day, Trump said he would “love” to run against former President Barack Obama—who also served two terms and cannot run for a third term—adding: “That would be a good one, I’d like that.” He quickly added he has “never looked into” whether he could run again, and said, “they do say there’s a way you can do it, but I don’t know about that … I want to do a fantastic job, we have four years, just about.” Months earlier, after he won reelection, TrumptoldHouse Republicans: “I suspect I won’t be running again unless you say, ‘He’s so good we’ve got to figure something else out.’”\n\nSteve Bannon, a key adviser from Trump’s first term,has saidin an interview on NewsNation he believes Trump will run again in the next election and suggested the Constitution may offer some possible loopholes, particularly around what constitutes a presidential term. When asked in her confirmation hearings whether Trump could run again, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “No, senator, not unless they change the Constitution”—though more recently she told Fox News she believes Trump will “be finished probably after this term,” and that if he wanted to run again they would “have to look at the Constitution,” which she described as “a heavy lift.” At least one House Republican has expressed support for Trump to run again andintroduceda House Joint Resolution to amend the Constitution so he could run for a third term.\n\nTrump’s Attorney General Says He ‘Probably’ Can’t Serve Third Term—What To Know(Forbes)\n\nTrump Says He Would ‘Love’ Running Against Obama For A Third Term(Forbes)",
        "source_3": "Weeks after President Trumpsaid he wanted to run for a third term, his namesake company is embracing the speculation by putting a red “Trump 2028” hat on sale.\n\n“The future looks bright! Rewrite the rules with the Trump 2028 high crown hat,” an initial description of the $50 item read on theTrump Org’s store website.\n\nThe description was later changed to read: “Make a statement with this Made in America Trump 2028 hat. Fully embroidered with a snap closure in the back, this will become your new go-to hat.”\n\nThe “rewrite the rules” come-on is likely a reference to the Constitution’s 22nd Amendment, which states that “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nThe Trump Organization has been run by the president’s two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, during their father’s presidencies.\n\nWhen asked by The Post why the company had put the potentially provocative headwear on sale, spokesperson Kimberly Benza responded: “Because it’s amazing.”\n\nLast month, Trumptold NBC Newshe was “not joking” about the possibility of another term, but added that “it is far too early to think about it.”\n\nOne potential loophole being floated by the president’s allies is having Vice President JD Vance run for the White House in 2028 with Trump as his running mate. Once elected, the theory goes, Vance could resign and have Trump step in.\n\nThe president agreed that that would be “one” method of getting around the 22nd Amendment, and said there are more ways he could skirt the rule.\n\n“A lot of people would like me to” be president again, Trump told the outlet in March.\n\nOthers suggest that Trump is floating the idea of seeking another term as an elaborate needling of Democrats.\n\n“You guys continue to ask the president this question about a third term and then he answers honestly and candidly with a smile and then everybody here melts down about his answer,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the White House last month.\n\nThe reason Americans are talking about another Trump term, she said, is because “people love the job this president is doing.”\n\nRep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) presented a constitutional amendment Jan. 23 that would edit the 22nd Amendment to allow a president to seek another term, as long as they were not elected in back-to-back cycles.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive term,” Ogles’ proposal read.\n\nShould Trump complete his current term in January 2029, he would be the oldest president in US history, breaking the record held by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Post."
