        "source_1": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced Friday that it will begin shutting down, weeks after Congress canceled previously approved funding for the nation's steward of public media access.\n\nThe CPBsaid in a statementthat it will begin an \"orderly wind-down\" of its operations after nearly 60 years with the support of the federal government.\n\nIt said that most staff positions will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. A small team of employees will remain through January 2026, it added. It did not specify how many people in total were being laid off.\n\n\"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,\" the corporation's president and CEO, Patricia Harrison, said in a statement. \"CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.\"\n\nThe announcement comes less than a month after Congresspassedapackage of spending cutsrequested by President Donald Trump that included stripping $1.1 billion in funding for the CPB.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the CPB should be stripped of funding despite objections from some Republican lawmakers whose districts include rural areas that rely on the local outlets.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly accused NPR and PBS of liberal bias, which the organizations have repeatedly denied.\n\n“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said.\n\nCurrently, the CPB helps support more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations.\n\nSome of the most revered national PBS and NPR programs are expected to remain on the air thanks to other sources of funding.\n\nKatherine Maher, president & CEO of NPR, said in a statement that NPR would support locally owned, nonprofit stations across the U.S. and “working to maintain public media’s promise of universal service.”\n\nShecharacterized the CPB\"as a vital source of funding for local stations, a champion of educational and cultural programming, and a bulwark for independent journalism.\" Maher called its closure \"an immediate consequence\" of the spending cuts.\n\nMaher said the CPB \"upheld the core values of the Public Broadcasting Act\" and said it allowed stations like NPR to \"deliver essential news and culture across the nation.\"\n\n\"The ripple effects of this closure will be felt across every public media organization and, more importantly, in every community across the country that relies on public broadcasting,\" Maher said.\n\nShortly after Congress passed the cuts, NPR announced that its editor-in-chief and senior vice president, Edith Chapin, had stepped down.\n\nPBS said in a statement that it remains \"committed to building on CPB’s legacy and maintaining our service to the American people for years to come.\"\n\nThe broadcaster also praised Harrison \"who for the last 20 years has ensured public television remained available and accessible to every American.\"\n\nIn the days after the cuts were finalized, \"PBS Newshour\" posted astatement on Xsaying the program \"is not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"We will continue our work without fear or favor, as we have for nearly five decades on the air,\" it said.",
