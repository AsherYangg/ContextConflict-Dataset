    "question": "How might Netanyahu’s pledge to continue the war until Israel has full control of Gaza, alongside his openness to a temporary ceasefire for hostage exchanges and his claim that Mohammed Sinwar is probably dead, shape the next phase of the conflict and the prospects for negotiations?",

        "source_1": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saysIsraelhas “probably” killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’ elusive de facto leader in Gaza.\n\n⁠“We have eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists,” said Netanyahu at a press conference on Wednesday evening. “We eliminated the leaders of the murderers Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and probablyMohammad Sinwar.”\n\nIsrael targeted Sinwar in a massive set of strikes on the European hospital in Khan Younis last week. The attack killed 28 Palestinians and wounded more than 50 others, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said after the strike.\n\nIf Sinwar’s death is confirmed, it would be the latest in a string of assassinations that have dealt a serious blow to the group’s top brass but are yet to break its grip on power.\n\nSinwar is the brother of former leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the Israeli military in southern Gaza in October.\n\nIn his first press conference in months, Netanyahu also vowed that Israel would not stop its newly launchedmilitary operationin Gaza.\n\nRelated articleIsrael targets Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in hospital strike in Gaza, sources say\n\n“Our forces are capturing more and more territory in Gaza,” he said. “At the end of the operation all areas of the Strip will be under Israeli security control.”\n\nNetanyahu said that Israel could agree to a temporary ceasefire that includes the release of hostages, but an end to the war would only come with a list of conditions, including the demilitarization of Gaza, the overthrow of Hamas, and the implementation of the US plan for voluntary emigration from the besieged enclave.\n\n“Gaza will be completely demilitarized, and we will carry out the Trump plan, which is so correct and so revolutionary, and it says something simple: The residents of Gaza who wish to leave – will be able to leave,” he said.\n\n“Anyone who calls on us to stop the war before these goals are achieved is calling on us to leave Hamas in power,” Netanyahu said.\n\nIn February, Trump put forward aproposal for the United States to “take over” Gaza, relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries, and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the “Riviera of the Middle East.”\n\nThe proposal was a stunningbreak with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and sent shockwaves through the region.\n\nNetanyahu also said there is “full coordination” with the United States on Iran as the Trump administration pursues a new nuclear deal with Tehran. He said any deal would have to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and stop the enrichment of uranium. CNN reported on Tuesday that US intelligence suggestsIsrael is preparing a possible strikeon Iran’s nuclear facilities.\n\n“The state of Israel maintains the right to defend itself against a regime that threatens to destroy it,” said Netanyahu.",

All the hostages return home, Hamas hands over its weapons and leaves power,” said Netanyahu at a press conference in Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu noted that Hamas’ leadership must all leave Gaza and Israel must ensure that the enclave is free of weapons. He also asserted that after all these conditions are met, Israel will move ahead and proceed with Trump’s proposed plan for the future of Gaza.\n\n“We [will] implement (President) Trump's plan, it is a good plan and makes a difference and it means something very simple, that the residents of Gaza who want to leave can leave.”\n\nTrump had previously floated the idea of resettling all of Gaza’s population in order for the US to “take ownership” of the land. The proposal was met with widespread regional and international disapproval, with many countries insisting that Gaza is Palestinian and should remain for the Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu also noted that he is open to a temporary truce with Hamas to release the remaining hostages. The Israeli leader added that Israeli intelligence suggests that 20 of the remaining 58 hostages still under Hamas captivity are believed to be alive.\n\nNetanyahu also slammed countries who’ve been calling out Israel over its actions and operations in Gaza. He stressed that the war will only end when Hamas is fully dismantled, adding that their disapproval of Israel’s war amounts to support for Hamas.\n\n“Anyone who calls us to end the war right before us achieving these goals, is actually calling for keeping Hamas in power.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the UK suspended free trade talks with Israel over its intensifying assault as the UK, Canada and France promised “concrete” steps to prompt Israel to halt the war.\n\nThe European Union was also reviewing an EU pact governing trade ties with Israel over its conduct of the war, according to its foreign policy chief.\n\nNetanyahu voiced his opposition to the recent developments.\n\n“I think this is a disgrace that Britain, instead of imposing sanctions on Hamas, imposes sanctions on a woman who is threatened daily on the roads of Judia and Samaria (the West Bank) by Hamas terrorists.\"\n\nHe also stated that US President Donald Trump remains on his side, laying rumours over a fractured relationship with Washington to rest.\n\n“Several days ago, maybe 10 days ago, or more, I spoke with Trump on the phone, and he told me, Bibi, I want you to know that I have an absolute commitment to you and I have an absolute commitment to Israel,” added Netanyahu.\n\nHamas says it is prepared to release the hostages in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory and an end to the war. It however rejects demands for exile and disarmament.",
        "source_3": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained defiant and came out swinging in a Wednesday press conference amid growing international isolation and pressure, even from allies.\n\nHedeclaredat a press conference in Jerusalem that Israelwill control all of Gaza when the military offensive ends, and this remains the ultimate goal - to fully and finally crush Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu described that it was days ago, upon the approval of Operation Gideon’s Chariots - the greatly expanded ground offensive in Gaza - that he made the decision to initiate the next stage of the war.\n\nHe asserted that\"At the end of this campaign, all of the territories of the Gaza Strip will be under Israel’s security control.\"\n\nHowever, he did also say that\"If there is an option for a temporary ceasefire to free hostages, we’ll be ready\"- this after calling back Israeli negotiators from Doha this week.\n\nHe further said in the televised news conference, which was his first since December, that \"We must avoid a humanitarian crisis in order to preserve our freedom of operational action.\"\n\nShortly after the address, regional headlines cited that dozens of aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip, which marks the end of an 80-day cutoff, and after intense pressure from allies to let aid flow, and amid fears of famine gripping the Palestinian population.\n\nThe BBC observed that Netanyahu's tone was one of defiance anddefensiveness:\n\nBenjamin Netanyahuwas in defensive mode, sticking to his guns and unfazed by critics- foreign and domestic - of his decision to step up the war in Gaza.\n\nOperation Gideon's Chariots is intended to “complete the war, the job”, said the Israeli Prime Minister at a rare press conference tonight to which only Israeli media were invited.\n\nDespite recent reports this week that President Trump is \"frustrated\" with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister believes he still has Washington'sfull backing:\n\nDespite growing calls from Israel’s European allies to end the war and address Gaza’s dire humanitarian needs,as long as he has the backing of the United States to continue the war in Gaza, Netanyahu indicated he will not change tack.\n\nHe said that his controversial aid plan for Gaza, which would bypass existing UN structures and facilities, would give Israel “another tool to win the war”. It’s a plan that has been widely condemned by the UN and foreign governments as akin to “weaponizing food aid”.\n\nBREAKING: Netanyahu: “I stand alone against the world — even against the self-haters in the Knesset — and I will not surrender. We will defeat Hamas.”pic.twitter.com/9FkUUyGxYv\n\n\"The president [Trump] isfrustrated about what is happening in Gaza.He wants the war to end, he wants the hostages to come home, he wants aid to go in and he wants to start rebuilding Gaza,\" one White House official said toAxios.\n\nYet, the reality is that US arms flow has shown no signs of slowing, nor has the billions in annual foreign aid doled out to Tel Aviv. Western leaders will likely continue their largely symbolic hand-wringing and expressions of 'frustration' - but nothing is likely to fundamentally change regarding the Israeli military's trajectory at this point. Gaza is being turned into a parking lot, essentially."
