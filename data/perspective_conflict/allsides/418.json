Read ourPrivacy notice\n\nPolice have arrested a 50-year-old manafter a car ploughed into a busyoutdoor Christmas market in Magdeburgon Friday evening,killing at least five peopleand injuring 200 others.\n\nAt least five people - including a nine-year-old boy and four women - were killed in the attack as the suspect is remanded in custody.\n\nFootage showed the vehicle breaking through barriers before speeding 400 metres through the crammed “fairytale-like” Magdeburg market.\n\nHere is everything we know about the suspect so far.\n\nThe suspect is a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia, named by German media as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen. On Saturday evening, he was remanded into custody after appearing in court.\n\n“The judge ordered pre-trial detention for five counts of murder, multiple attempted murder and multiple counts of dangerous bodily harm,” its statement said.\n\nAuthorities confirmed that he first came to Germany in 2006 and later gained refugee status in 2016.\n\nLocal media reported that he had shown support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), with a Saudi source tellingReutersthat the kingdom had warned German authorities about the attacker, who the source said had posted extremist views on his personal X account.\n\nA German security source told the news agency that tips sent by the Saudi authorities in 2023 and 2024 had been passed on to the relevant authorities. NewspaperDie Weltcited security sources as saying that a risk assessment conducted by state and federal investigators concluded that the man posed “no specific danger”.\n\nInterior minister Nancy Faeser told reporters on Saturday: “At this point, we can only say for sure that the perpetrator was evidently Islamophobic — we can confirm that. Everything else is a matter for further investigation and we have to wait.”\n\nIn the days since his arrest, an interview the suspect gave to the BBC in 2019 has resurfaced.\n\nIn the video, he is seen speaking about a website he designed to help former Muslims flee the Gulf region.\n\nHe worked as a psychiatric doctor in the nearby town of Bernburg, with his workplace issuing a statement describing their shock at the attack.\n\nPosting on Instagram, the Salus-Fachklinikum Bernburg clinic said it was “shocked to learn that the alleged perpetrator worked as a specialist doctor in our enforcement in Bernburg”.\n\nIt added that the suspect had been employed there as a psychiatric specialist since March 2020, but he had not been working since October due to illness and holiday.\n\nGerman public broadcaster MDR previously reported that police suspected there could be explosives in the suspect’s car, but police later confirmed none were found after closer inspection.\n\nAt least five people were killed in the shocking incident, authorities confirmed. One of those killed was a nine-year-old child.\n\nAuthorities confirmed on Saturday that 200 people have been injured, including 40 very seriously.\n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern about the condition of those injured. He told reporters: “Almost 40 are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.”\n\nMr Haseloff told reporters earlier that additional deaths could not be ruled out due to the number of people injured.",

        "source_3": "At least 5 people have died and more than 40 had life threatening injuries.\n\nGermanlaw enforcement officials were repeatedly warned by Saudi Arabia that a man who drove into 200+ people at a Christmas event in Germany on Friday night was dangerous — warnings that Germany’s leftist government ignored.\n\nCNN reported that the chief of the Magdeburg Public Prosecutor’s office, Horst Walter Nopens, said that 50-year-old doctor Taleb al-Abdulmohsen may have been “disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany.”\n\nHe is accused of driving a car down a road that was completely packed with people who were at a Christmas market in Magdeburg. At least 5 people have died and more than 40 had life threatening injuries.\n\nSaudi Arabiasentthree warnings about the suspect to the German government, warning that he had posted extremist views online and was a threat to their security. Saudi Arabia first warned Germany about the man in 2007, just one year after he entered the country, and requested in 2007 and 2008 that he be extradited back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMainstream publications latched onto statements that he made online where he claimed that he was aggressively anti-Islam and that he supported the country’s anti-immigration party, the AfD.\n\nHowever, there have been serious questions raised about whether he was being serious with his posts or if he was trying to deceive people on social media.\n\nSeveral Iranian dissidents suggested online that the suspect actually was an Islamic extremist and that he was lying about what he really believed.\n\nTaleb Al Abdulmohsen is not an atheist. He is a Shia extremist. Just because a Muslim self identifies as an Atheist or claims to have converted to Christianity – recent case in the UK – it doesn’t mean it’s truth.\n\nDespite claims made by the German press, Taleb Al Abdulmohsen is not an ex-Muslim atheist, nor is he a fan of the AfD or Elon Musk. While he may have spread this misinformation himself, it aligns with the practice of Taqqiye, an Islamic doctrine that permits lying and deception…pic.twitter.com/tU2tRS51Lr\n\nThe man who was arrested for the most recent terrorist attack on a Christmas market- this time in Magdeburg, Germany- is allegedly Saudi national Taleb Al Abdulmohsen. I’ve known him for years (online only) and he never seemed stable to me. He obsessively went after an ExMuslim…\n\n— Yasmine Mohammed 🦋 ياسمين محمد (@YasMohammedxx)December 21, 2024\n\nIf the suspect in the Christmas market attack is an ex-Muslim and an atheist then why was he screaming “Allahu Ukbar” (at 17 seconds into this video) when he was being arrested??pic.twitter.com/wHT7a3Hai8\n\nAccording to Germany’s Bild newspaper, police intervened and broke up a demonstration of right-wing Germans who protested after the attack.\n\nGerman publications called them “right-wing extremists” who shouted “disgusting slogans.”\n\nThe slogans that were shouted included, “Anyone who doesn’t love Germany should leave Germany,” “Migration kills,” “We must take back our cities, our villages and our homeland,” “Deport, deport, deport,”and “Resistance.”\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.
