        "source_1": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump‘s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday opened up with comedianTony Hinchcliffe—of the comedy podcast Kill Tony—calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” among other xenophobic and prejudiced punchlines. The ’quip' did not appear to land with the crowd in attendance.\n\nHinchcliffe continued by deploying a crass sexual slur for Latino immigrants—joking that they should all leave the country.\n\n“These Latinos, they love making babies, too, just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out,” he said. “They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country.”\n\nHe also delved into racist stereotypes for Black people and played into antisemitic tropes when addressing the Gaza-Israel war during a relatively short set.\n\nHuffPostreporter Christopher Mathias, among those in attendance,labeledit “shockingly racist even for a Trump rally.”\n\nThese people have no sense of humor. Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his “busy schedule” to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone…watch the whole set. I’m a…https://t.co/VFxHRcdv5k\n\nHinchcliffe justified the contents of his set by saying: “Republicans are the party with a good sense of humor.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who is Puerto Rican herself, punched back at the comments Sunday afternoon during a live-stream event with her party’s vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n“When you have some a-hole calling Puerto Rico ‘floating garbage,’ know that that’s what they think about you,” she said. “It’s what they think about anyone who makes less money than them.”\n\nHinchcliffe later lashed out at the pair in a post on X, saying that he was simply doing comedy—while claiming that he loves Puerto Rico because he vacations there.\n\n“These people have no sense of humor,” he wrote. “Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone…watch the whole set.\"\n\nKill Tony, Hinchcliffe’s comedy show with 1.8 million Youtube subscribers, features new and established comedians. Jokes commonly venture off into the raunchy side, where racist and sexist humor are regular.\n\n“Normally I don‘t make my political beliefs a known thing,” Hinchcliffe said at the rally. “It‘s divisive for a comedian to do that. But, just know I sleep well at night knowing who I’m voting for.”\n\n“It‘s just obvious to me who the right candidate is,” Hinchcliffe continued. He then called Trump’s shot to the ear “the best place to get shot.”",
        "source_2": "A comedian at a Donald Trump rally called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\", sparking fury from Republicans and Democrats and accusations of racism.\n\nThe comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was among the speakers at the Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday. He also made a series of jokes that leant on racist stereotypes.\n\nA Trump adviser distanced the former president from the Puerto Rico joke, which was also denounced by Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris. Harris herself was the target of another Trump warm-up speaker who also sparked controversy.\n\nThe furore came as one of the world's top Latin celebrities, Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, endorsed Harris for president.\n\nIn his joke, Hinchcliffe, known for his comedy podcast Kill Tony, said: \"There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe line appeared to meet a mixed reception. Two Republicans in the state of Florida, which has a prominent Puerto Rican population, were among those who called out the joke.\n\nUS congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said she was \"disgusted\" by the \"racist comment\". She said on X that it did not \"reflect the GOP values\", referring to the Republican Party, and noted thousands of Puerto Ricans served in the military.\n\nUS Senator Rick Scott said: \"The joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and it's not true.\" He added that \"Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans\".\n\nPuerto Rico is a US island territory in the Caribbean. Its residents are unable to vote in US presidential elections, but there is a large diaspora across the US who can.\n\nHinchcliffe also suggested Latinos \"loved making babies\".\n\nHe drew on racist tropes about black people and watermelons, which prompted groans from the audience - and he called Palestinians rock-throwers while in the same sentence suggested Jews would not spend money - invoking an antisemitic trope.\n\nAccording to the BBC's US partner CBS, a source familiar with the event confirmed that the Trump campaign vetted Hinchcliffe's list of jokes - but the comments about Puerto Rico, Latinos and black people were ad-libbed. The campaign also said it cut two profane jokes.\n\nTrump himself has remained silent on the row. He has faced calls to apologise from the archbishop of Puerto Rico and the head of the island's Republican Party, among others.\n\nMr Hinchcliffe defended his material after the backlash. \"These people have no sense of humour,\" he wrote on X in response to criticism from Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz.\n\nThe comedian added: \"I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone… watch the whole set.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded: \"You don't 'love Puerto Rico'. You like drinking piña coladas. There's a difference.\" She had earlier said Hinchcliffe's comments were \"super upsetting\", noting that her family was from Puerto Rico.\n\nThe night's other speakers courted controversy with their own remarks. David Rem, a childhood friend of Trump, called Harris \"the devil\" and \"the antichrist\".\n\nAnd Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani falsely claimed the Democratic candidate was \"on the side of the terrorists\" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAlthough much of the focus was on the comments by his guest speakers, Trump used the occasion to announce a plan for tax credits for those who take care of a parent or a loved one. \"It's about time that they were recognised,\" he said.\n\nHe also reiterated plans for a mass deportation for illegal migrants, speaking of his wish to \"rescue\" places that had been \"invaded and conquered\" by \"vicious and bloodthirsty criminals\".\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Harris unveiled policies aimed at helping those in Puerto Rico - garnering support from Jennifer Lopez, who has Puerto Rican parents, as well as Bad Bunny. Numerous other big-name celebrities have already backed her.\n\nBad Bunny posted multiple videos of Harris talking about the island, her ideas to help residents, and her attacks on how Trump handled Hurricane Maria as president when the deadly storm killed nearly 3,000 people there in 2017.\n\nA source close to Bad Bunny confirmed to CBS that this represented an endorsement of Harris, breaking his longstanding tradition of not weighing in on national politics.\n\nIn the last seven years, there has been an exodus from Puerto Rico, whose inhabitants have moved to the mainland US including Florida and swing states such as North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Puerto Ricans are now reportedly the second largest Latino subgroup in those states.\n\nBad Bunny's comments appeared to be pre-planned, and he did not address the remarks by Hinchcliffe. But fellow Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin did, telling his fans \"this is what they think of us\" and urging them to vote for Harris.\n\nThere are around 36 million Hispanic voters eligible to vote this year, according to the Pew Research centre. They have generally formed a key plank of the Democratic coalition but Republicans have been eating into that support.\n\nMadison Square Garden, near the heart of the city, is one of the most famous venues in the world and capable of seating about 20,000.\n\nIt is also in Trump's hometown, and the city in which he landed a historic criminal conviction earlier this year.\n\nNew York - viewed by some as a curious choice for the final week of campaigning - is a solid blue state and will not be decisive in the race for the White House.\n\nTony Hinchcliffe is a stand-up comedian based in Austin, Texas, known for his podcast Kill Tony, which offers stand up comedians the opportunity to audition for 60 seconds before Hinchcliffe and his co-host, Brian Redban.\n\nThe podcast has 1.89 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nThe comedian grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, and described himself as \"the class clown\".  He got his start in the comedy world working for Joe Rogan and writing jokes for celebrities on Comedy Central Roast.\n\nThis is not the first time some of his comments have made headlines for their offensive nature.\n\nIn 2021, he used a racial slur when referring to American-Chinese comedian Peng Deng during a comedy set and refused to apologise.\n\n\"I knew that what I had done was not wrong,” Hinchcliffe said when askedby Varietyabout that controversy.  \"It was so dumbfounding to me because it was a joke, and my stance is that comedians should never apologise for a joke.\"\n\nHinchcliffe was one of the comedians who appeared on former NFL star Tom Brady's Netflix comedy roast earlier this year.\n\nAdditional reporting by James FitzGerald and Ana Faguy\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.\n\nReaders in the UScan sign up here.Those in the UKcan sign up here.\n\nThe BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques.\n\nThe former US president says he has no regrets over his late withdrawal in the contest against Donald Trump.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe accused says his attorneys were not answering his questions and that they were \"a million miles apart\".\n\nJoe Biden's son directs expletive-filled accusations at the Hollywood actor for his part in the former president quitting the campaign.\n\nThe BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe former US president says he has no regrets over his late withdrawal in the contest against Donald Trump.",

It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them. It's what they think about the people who serve them food in a restaurant. It's what they think about the people who, who fold their clothes in a store,\" the Democrat from New York asserted.\n\nThe lawmaker's \"mother was born and raised in Puerto Rico,\" according to hercongressional website.\n\nHinchcliffe responded to the clip of Ocasio-Cortez and Walz, declaring in a post on X that he loves and vacations in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"These people have no sense of humor.

This isn't the comedy store. You're using your set to boost neo-Nazis like MTG & stripping women's rights to the Stone Age.

Ritchie Torres of New York also blasted the comedian.\n\n\"As a Puerto Rican, I'm tempted to call Tony Hinchcliffe racist garbage, but doing so would be an insult to garbage. When casting their ballots at the voting booth, Latinos should never forget the racism that Donald Trump seems all too willing to platform,\" the congressman tweeted.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., tweeted, \"This is not a joke. It’s completely classless & in poor taste.
