Photo: Wisam Hashlamoun/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nU.S. officials are extremely concerned about a potentially major security breach after two alleged U.S. intelligence documents about Israel's preparations for anattack on Iranwere published by a Telegram account affiliated with Iran.\n\nWhy it matters:The alleged leak comes as Israel completes weeks of preparations for a retaliation against Iran, which attacked Israel with abarrage of ballistic missileson Oct. 1.\n\nDriving the news:A Telegram channel by the name \"Middle East Spectator\" claimed on Friday that it had received documents from a source in the U.S. intelligence community about Israel's preparations for an attack on Iran.\n\nThe alleged report details measuresthat have been carried out in recent days at several Israeli Air Force bases, including the transfer of advanced munitions which, according to the report, were intended for an attack on Iran.\n\nBetween the lines:The report, if accurate, would suggest very close and detailed surveillance by U.S. intelligence of Israel's preparations for an attack on Iran, including the use of satellites to spy on operations carried out at Israeli Air Force bases.\n\nWhat they're saying:A U.S. official told Axios that the alleged leak is extremely concerning, but that he doesn't believe it would influence Israel's operational plans against Iran.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTop secret U.S. intelligence outlining Israel's plans for an attack on Iran appear to have been leaked online in what would constitute a significant security breach if proved authentic.\n\nAxios reported on Saturday that two alleged U.S. intelligence documents with details of Israeli preparations to hit back at Iran appeared on a Tehran-affiliated channel on messaging app Telegram. The channel's administrators said in a statement on Sunday that it was not linked to Iran, but run by a \"tight-knit team of fully independent journalists.\"\n\nThe documents were marked \"top secret,\" and dated October 15 to 16. The documents purport to show \"key munitions preparations and covert UAV [uncrewed aerial vehicle] activity\" and were described as being linked to a possible Israeli attack on Iran. At least one document appears to bear markings from the U.S.' National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency toldNewsweekthat they were \"looking into the reports,\" but would not comment on, or speculate on, \"alleged or actual intelligence matters.\" The Israeli Defense Ministry declined to comment when approached on Sunday.\n\nIsrael is still thought to be weighing up its response to Iran's attack at the start of October, when Tehran fired around 200 ballistic missiles at the country. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that there was some minor damage.\n\nIn April, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in its first-ever direct attack Israelis from Iranian territory. Tehran said the aerial assault was a retaliatory strike after seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in Damascus, the capital and largest city of Syria. Israel has not commented on the strike.\n\nThree people familiar with the documents and the alleged leak toldCNNthat the U.S. is investigating the apparent leak, with one U.S. official describing the situation as \"deeply concerning.\"\n\nA U.S. defense official toldNewsweekthat the government is looking into the reports.\n\nThe Middle East Spectator Telegram channel, which posted the documents, said on Sunday that its administrators were \"not aware of any additional leaked classified U.S. documents.\"\n\nThe channel has \"no connection to the original source, which we assume to be a whistleblower within the U.S. Department of Defense,\" the administrators said. In an earlier statement, the channel said it was \"not aware\" of the leaker's identity, nor whether the documents were authentic.\n\nOne unnamed source familiar with the documents confirmed their authenticity, CNN reported.\n\nThe Middle East Spectator channel said the documents had first popped up in a private Telegram group with around 7,000 members, before the documents \"found their way out of the group.\"\n\nThe channel came across the documents through an anonymous direct message, its administrators said, adding that similar messages were \"sent to various other people and news outlets.\"\n\nIn late 2022 to early 2023, highly-classified U.S. intelligence was published on social media platform Discord in the broadest and most public intelligence leak in years. Jack Teixeira, who had served with the Massachusetts Air National Guard, pleaded guilty in federal court to retaining and transmitting classified National Defense Information.\n\nUpdate 10/20/2024 at 12:20 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with responses from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the Israeli Defense Ministry.\n\nEllie Cook is a Newsweek security and defense reporter based in London, U.K. Her work focuses largely on the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. military, weapons systems and emerging technology.

        "source_3": "The Biden-Harris administration is investigating a \"deadly serious breach\" of classified U.S. intelligence detailing Israeli plans for a strike on Iran, the latest in a series of targeted leaks against Israel that has put America’s closest Middle East ally on edge, according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\nThe explosive weekend release included top-secret Pentagon documents purporting to show Israel's preparations for a large-scale counterstrike on Iran. The two documents—compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency over the past several weeks—expose how Israel is preparing for the attack, including the types of aircraft and munitions that are expected to be used. They were published by theMiddle East Spectator, a little-known outlet that is known to disseminate propaganda from Tehran.\n\nWhile the documents, according toCNN, include markings that indicate they were meant to be shared with the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence network—made up of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada—a former U.S. intelligence community official who reviewed them said there is no question they emanated from the U.S. side. The documents, the former official said, appear to have been posted on a U.S. classified system that can be accessed by \"thousands upon thousands\" of American officials from across the government.\"\n\n\"They all can literally log onto a classified computer and pull up the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency’s website and look at whatever is made available to them,\" the former official said. \"Why would you allow any intelligence like this, whether it’s compartmentalized or not, why would you ever allow that to be generally available?\"\n\nWhile the documents do not detail which sites Israel is likely to attack inside Iran, they are the latest in a string of leaks that have raised questions about the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to safeguard information at the highest levels of government. For Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon adviser, that trend is likely to erode Israel’s trust in the United States.\n\n\"The damage wrought by this leak has less to do with tipping Iran off about or tactical insight into an impending Israeli strike than with broader bilateral trust,\" Rubin said. \"This is not the first time a U.S. administration has leaked top secret details meant to sidetrack Israeli efforts to undermine Iran's nuclear program.\"\n\nIn the end, Rubin said, \"it's not Israel that will ultimately pay the price; it's the United States. The U.S. intelligence community can gain more from Israel than vice versa. By signaling Israel can't trust Washington, the United States will essentially be operating blind, learning about Israel actions from the media after the fact, just like the rest of the world. In a region where minutes can make the difference between life and death, this is a truly high price to bear.\"\n\nOne senior Biden-Harris administration official, who was not authorized to speak on record about the situation, described the leak as a \"deadly serious breach.\"\n\n\"For at least the past year there has been a concerted campaign to leak what at least seems to be classified information by anti-Israel elements in large part to impact media narratives—but, if true, this obviously goes beyond that,\" the official said.\n\nA U.S. defense official, also speaking only on background, confirmed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is \"looking into these reports\" as it seeks to determine how a cache of highly secretive documents, dated Oct. 15 and 16, made their way to a pro-Iran media account entity that published them on Telegram.\n\nThe White House National Security Council declined to comment, referring requests to the Pentagon and ODNI, which also would not speak on record. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on the documents, their authenticity, and efforts to identify the leaker.\n\n\"It is extremely alarming that pro-Iranian social media accounts are posting what appears to be leaked intelligence on Israeli operations and planning,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees the U.S. defense establishment. \"Whoever committed this outrageous act is putting our ally at risk, and they need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nTheMiddle East Spectatorsaid in astatementthat the documents were originally posted inside a Telegram channel, where the leaker is likely an active participant. The outlet said it is \"not aware\" of any additional classified leaks. It also identified the leaker as potentially an employee with the State Department, which would have access to top-secret assessments.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nLast week, private communications between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austinspilled into public view, showing a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure Israel into pumping more aid into the embattled Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The letter included a threat to cut off critical U.S. arms sales to Israel if it does not improve humanitarian conditions on the ground. The leak fueled accusations that the Biden-Harris administration is trying to embarrass Israel as it leans on the Jewish state to end its war against Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nEarlier in the year, a State Department document assessing that Israel was in breach of American laws mandating humanitarian assistance in times of war also spilled into public view, jolting Israeli leadership and driving calls among some Democrats for arms sales to be cut off.\n\nThe leak has also raised fresh questions about several senior Biden-Harris administration officials who are known to advocate for increased diplomacy with Iran. This includes senior Pentagon official Ariane Tabatabai, who wasidentified last yearas a member of a secretive pro-Iran influence group operated by the hardline regime’s government.\n\nPublished under:Antony Blinken,Biden-Harris Administration,Department of Defense,Iran,Israel,Lloyd Austin,State Department"
