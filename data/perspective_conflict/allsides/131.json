        "source_1": "The detained crew of theGaza-bound aid shipthat was intercepted by Israel on Monday morning docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod Monday evening, according to Israel’s foreign ministry.\n\nThose on board the Madleen aid ship, including Sweden’s Greta Thunberg and other prominent activists, underwent medical examinations on Monday evening, the foreign ministry said.\n\nOn arrival to Ashdod, the activists were taken to a room to be shown a screening of the “horror film documenting the October 7 massacre” carried out by Hamas, according to Israeli defense minister Israel Katz.\n\n“When they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching,” Katz claimed.\n\nKatz accused Greta and the rest of the ship’s crew of ignoring Hamas atrocities by “closing their eyes to the truth.”\n\nThe Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) said the Israeli military had “attacked” and “unlawfully boarded” the Madleen, which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza – where more than 600 days of war, and an 11-week Israeli blockade of all aid, has pushed the enclave’s 2.1 million people deeper intoa hunger crisis.\n\nEarlier on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel planned to bring the detained activists to Ashdod port and then through a “quick deportation process” via Ben-Gurion Airport.\n\nThe ministry also previously posted a video showing members of the Madleen crew sitting side by side wearing orange life jackets while a solider offered them bottled water and plastic-wrapped sandwiches. Thunberg can be seen sitting near the front of the group.\n\nThe FFC had earliersaid the ship had come “under assault in international waters” in a Telegram post.\n\n“Quadcopters are surrounding the ship, spraying it with a white paint-like substance. Communications are jammed, and disturbing sounds are being played over the radio,” the FFC said. A video posted by Israel’s foreign ministry appeared to show a Navy staffer sending a radio message to the vessel saying the “maritime zone off the coast of Gaza was closed.”\n\nIn a video livestreamed from the boat, activist Yasemin Acar showed a white substance on the deck, saying it had been dropped on the vessel. Acar was later heard saying it was affecting her eyes.\n\nThe FFC group also posted a video on Telegram, showing members of the crew sitting inside the boat with their hands in the air.\n\nAfter losing communication with the vessel, the FFC began posting pre-recorded video messages from Thunberg and others onboard. “If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel,” Thunberg said in her video.\n\nLater Monday, US President Donald Trump called Thunberg a “strange” and “young, angry person,” telling a roundtable event at the White House that he thinks she “has to go to an anger management class.”\n\n“That’s my primary recommendation for her,” Trump said. “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg.”\n\nRelated articleAid to Gaza hangs by a thread amid looting and starvation\n\nIn a statement, the FFC said Israel had acted with “total impunity” and that the vessel’s cargo, which included baby formula, food and medical supplies was “confiscated.” Israel said it would transfer the goods to Gaza through humanitarian channels.\n\n“Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers aboard the Madleen,” said Huwaida Arraf, human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organizer. “This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the (International Court of Justice’s) binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza.”\n\nAmnesty International also condemned the detention of the activists.\n\n“The operation of intercepting and blocking the Madleen in the middle of the night and in international waters violates international law and put the safety of those on the boat at risk,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Israel said that it “is preventing the entry of all vessels into the Gaza Strip, in accordance with international law.”\n\nIsrael had repeatedly vowed to stop the aid boat from reaching Gaza, and described the ship as a “selfie yacht” carrying “celebrities.”\n\n“I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the Madleen flotilla does not reach Gaza,” Katz said on Sunday.\n\nIsrael’s foreign ministry said the group “attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity.”\n\n“There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip – they do not involve Instagram selfies,” it added.\n\nIn an earlier statement on Monday, the ministry said “unauthorized attempts to breach the blockade are dangerous, unlawful, and undermine ongoing humanitarian efforts.”\n\nThe French foreign ministry said on Monday that there were six French nationals on board the Madleen, and that it is in contact with Israeli authorities to bring them back. The French government had previously warned the activists against their plan “due to the risks involved,” a statement from the ministry added.\n\nAn Élysée source told CNN that France’s President Emmanuel Macron “has requested that arrangements be made, as quickly as possible, for the return” of its nationals.\n\nThe foreign ministry statement also called on the Israeli government to allow “immediate, large-scale, and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to Gaza.”\n\nHamas demanded the immediate release of the activists and condemned their detention in a statement, calling the interception “a flagrant violation of international law, and an attack on civilian volunteers acting out of humanitarian motives.”\n\nAs the Madleen was taken to Ashdod, some 15 activists protested the ship’s seizure in the city. The demonstrators carried signs reading, “resist genocide,” “release the Madleen activists now” and “stop state terror.”\n\n“We… have come to express our support and solidarity with the Madleen as part of the Freedom Flotilla, whose activists were abducted by Israel,” one activist said in English. The demonstrators were interrupted by a passerby who shouted in Hebrew, “You’re living in Israel,” calling the protesters “bullies” and “hooligans.”\n\nTheMadleenis part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel’s blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.\n\nThe crew, which had publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military. On Monday morning, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza, but the tracker has since appeared to have stopped.\n\n“We know that it’s a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.\n\nIsrael imposed a full humanitarian blockade of Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory for 11 weeks.\n\nFaced with growing international pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of aid in late May. But humanitarian organizations say it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, and have warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine. A UN-backed report warned in late April that one in five people werefacing starvation.\n\n﻿Dozens of Palestinianshave been killedover the past week while on their way to try and obtain aid from a new US-backed group commissioned to deliver aid to Gaza, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The group is intended to replace the UN-led system of distributing aid in Gaza. The United Nations has warned that the new distribution mechanism has become a“death trap”for desperate people seeking food in the strip.\n\nLast month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came underwhat its organizersclaimed was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.\n\nThe ship, the Conscience, was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists, including Thunberg, were due to board before it departed for Gaza.\n\nThe later voyage on the Madleen, which was intercepted by Israel, departed from Sicily last Friday.\n\nAn earlier version of this article mistakenly stated Irish actor Liam Cunningham was onboard the Madleen. The FFC has confirmed he is not onboard.\n\nCNN’s Oren Liebermann, Nadeen Ebrahim, Saskya Vandoorne and Samantha Waldenberg contributed reporting.",
