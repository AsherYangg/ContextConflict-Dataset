        "source_1": "The White House took aggressive aim at Amazon, with President Donald Trump putting in a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos Tuesday morning, after the company considered displaying the added cost of tariffs on certain items.\n\nTrump called Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering displaying the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website, two senior White House officials told CNN. Trump latersaid it was a “good call.”\n\n“Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”\n\nPunchbowl News first reportedthat Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move could directly illustrate to American consumers how Trump’s tariffs are affecting the cost of goods. Trump has slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.\n\nThe call came shortly after one of the senior officials phoned the president to inform him of the story.\n\n“Of course he was pissed,” one of the officials, granted anonymity to speak candidly, told CNN. “Why should a multibillion dollar company pass off costs to consumers?”\n\nAt a briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calledthe move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.\n\n“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the move “was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.”\n\nAmazon, however, said it was considering the “idea of listing import charges on certain products” on Haul, itsspinoff website that sells items below $20, but the change wasn’t rolled out.\n\n“This was never approved and not going to happen,” an Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraged businesses to do just that.\n\n“To the large businesses that sell to consumers, I say show your customers how much tariffs are hurting in their pocketbook. People deserve to know the impact tariffs have on their finances,” Schumer said in remarksdelivered on the Senate floor.\n\nOther e-commerce websites,like Shein and Temu,have said they implemented changes to their pricing due to the cost of tariffs. Temu has even introduced a new import charge that is displayed at checkout. Both companies source most of their products from China.\n\nLeavitt on Tuesday also cited aReuters report from 2021about an alleged partnership between Amazon and a “Chinese propaganda arm” that censored user reviews on its Chinese website for President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings.\n\nShe said that was “another reason why Americans should buy American,” adding that“it’s another reason why we are onshoring critical supply chains here at home, to shore up our own critical supply chain and boost our own manufacturing here.”\n\nBezos has actively worked to cultivate a relationship with the president in his second term, congratulating him on his November election and dining at the White House.\n\nAmazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and is producing adocumentary focused on first lady Melania Trump.\n\nTrump recently praised Bezos,telling The Atlanticin an interview published Monday: “He’s 100 percent. He’s been great.”\n\nBezos’ net worth has declined by $30 billion since the start of this year,according to Bloomberg Billionaire Index, partly as a result of Trump’s tariff policies and a decline in the stock market.",
        "source_2": "The White House took aim at Amazon on Tuesday after the e-commerce giantreportedlyprepared to directly display to consumers the price increases associated with President Donald Trump’s tariffs—with Trump calling Amazon founder Jeff Bezos personally to complain—but the retailer denied it considered implementing such a wide-sweeping effort.\n\nCiting an unnamed source with knowledge of the plan, Punchbowl NewsreportedAmazon, which relies on China for just more than50%of its third-party sellers, intends to show how much of a good’s cost on the site comes from tariffs.\n\nIn a Tuesday briefing with reporters, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed this as a “hostile and political act by Amazon,” saying she discussed the matter with Trump.\n\nTrump called Bezos on Tuesday morning to complain about the reports, two senior officials in the White Housetold CNN, adding the president was “pissed.”\n\nTrumpconfirmedTuesday afternoon he talked to “good guy” Bezos, who “did the right thing” and “solved the problem very quickly,” according to the president.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyletoldthe Bezos-owned Washington Post there was “never a consideration for the main Amazon site” to display the levy-related fees to consumers, but wrote in a statement to Forbes the company “considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products” on its ultra-discount Haul platform.\n\nThe Haul tariff price listing was “never approved and not going to happen,” added Doyle.\n\nAmazon stock declined more than 2% on Tuesday morning following Leavitt’s jab at the retailer, recovering to a flat daily move as tensions smoothed over.\n\n“Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?,” Leavitt questioned Tuesday. It’s not exactly a one-for-one comparison considering tariffs directly equate to higher import costs, while inflation under President Joe Biden was a confluence of several factors with uneven effects on different classes of goods.\n\nLeavitt declined to comment on the “president’s relationship with Jeff Bezos,” the Amazon chairman whodinedwith Trump at the latter’s Mar-a-Lago resort in December. Bezos was present at Trump’s inauguration, to which Amazondonated$1 million. ForbesestimatesBezos is the second-richest person in the world with a roughly $200 billion net worth, trailing only Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the self-described “first buddy” of Trump.\n\nAmazon will report earnings for 2025’s first quarter Thursday afternoon. The company brought in $638 billion in revenue last year, trailing only Walmart as the highest company by sales in the world.",
        "source_3": "Amazon said it has ruled out a plan to display a tariff surcharge on product listings after its founder Jeff Bezos got an angry call from President Trump and the White House called it a “hostile and political act”.\n\nThe e-commerce giant said Tuesday that it weighed showing import charges on its discount shopping site Haul, but said the idea “was never approved and is not going to happen.” Amazon said it had never considered displaying the charges on its flagship shopping site.\n\nThat’s after President Trump placed an angry call to billionaire Bezos over areport in Punchbowl Newsthat Amazon had planned to display “how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.”\n\nAmazon decided on the label because it “doesn’t want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump’s trade war,” according to the report, which cited an anonymous source.\n\nA source confirmed to The Post that Trump had placed the call to Bezos, which wasfirst reported by the Wall Street Journal. In a Tuesday briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused the Seattle-based web giant of being “China-aligned” over the Punchbowl report.\n\n“This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” Leavitt said. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?”\n\nBut an Amazon spokesperson told The Post that the initial report wasn’t accurate.\n\n“The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told The Post. “This was never approved and is not going to happen.”\n\n“Punchbowl News stands by its reporting,” a spokesperson from Punchbowl News said in a statement.\n\nBefore Amazon’s denial, Leavitt said she “just got off the phone” with President Trump about Amazon’s reported plans to add the label, though she added that she “will not speak to the president’s relationships with [company founder] Jeff Bezos.”\n\nThe dustup comes just days after Trump praised former foe Bezos, saying the billionaire mogul has been “great.”\n\nIn aninterview with The Atlantic, Trump described the transformation ofonce-adversarial relationships with Bezosand Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg into partnerships grounded in mutual “respect.”\n\nThe president credited Bezos and Zuckerberg for adjusting their companies’ policies in ways that align with his administration’s values.\n\n“They’ve been great,” Trump said of the tech moguls.\n\n“It’s just a higher level of respect. I don’t know. Maybe they didn’t know me at the beginning, and they know me now.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s April 2 announcement of significant tariffs on goods from China, Amazon sellers have increased prices on numerous popular items, including home appliances, electronics, and clothing.\n\nNearly 1,000 products sold on Amazon have seen price increases since mid-April, as US tariffs on Chinese imports ripple through the retail sector.\n\nAccording to SmartScout, a price analysis software firm, the average price jump across those items is close to 30%.\n\nThe increases span a broad range of consumer goods — from phone chargers to women’s apparel — with brands like Anker, a leading seller of mobile charging accessories, raising prices on roughly a quarter of its Amazon-listed products.\n\n“It’s one of the first concerted efforts I’ve seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,” said SmartScout CEO Scott Needhamtold CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nBezos, who also owns the Washington Post, made headlines just before the election when heblocked his newspaper’s editorial boardfrom publishing a prepared endorsement of Trump’s opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBezos has also implementedan overhaul of the Washington Post’s opinion pagewhich has seen an exodus of left-leaning commentators after the mogul stated his preference for touting “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\nJust hours after the change was announced, Bezos joined Trump for a private dinner, signaling a sharp departure from the tensions that defined their relationship during Trump’s first term."
