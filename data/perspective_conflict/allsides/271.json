        "source_1": "GREENBELT, Md. ― In a blow to the Trump administration, a federal judge ruled Friday the U.S. government acted illegally when itmistakenly deporteda Maryland father to El Salvador and ordered that he must be returned to the United States.\n\n“This was an illegal act,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland said of the deportation ofKilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nXinis gave the administration until 11:59 p.m. Monday to remove Abrego Garcia from theviolent El Salvador prisonwhere he is being held and return him to U.S. soil.\n\nAbrego Garcia, 29, was among the hundreds of alleged members of crime gangsMS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Araguathe government expelled from the U.S. to El Salvador last month.\n\nAbrego Garcia, who had fled El Salvador as a teenager to escape gang violence, was pulled over by federal immigration agents near his home in Beltsville, Maryland, on March 12 and arrested. Three days later, he was expelled and sent back to El Salvador even though he had won a court order six years earlier barring his removal.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged in court records earlier this week that his deportation was a mistake, which it attributed to an “administrative error.” But the U.S. government says it has no jurisdiction to order his return because he is in a foreign country.\n\n'Devastated and confused':A Maryland dad was sent to El Salvador prison by mistake. Can his community get him back?\n\nAbrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and their 5-year-old son, who are both U.S. citizens, sued the government demanding his return.\n\nDuring a hearing on Friday, Xinis ripped into Justice Department lawyers over Abrego Garcia's arrest and questioned the government's claim it could not get him back. If federal authorities were able to strike terms and conditions for his placement in El Salvador, \"then certainly they have the functional control to unwind the decision – the wrong decision,\" she said.\n\nErez Reuveni, the Justice Department’s attorney, conceded under questioning from Xinis that Abrego Garcia should not have been expelled and said he also had questioned why the government could not bring him back to the U.S.\n\n\"My answer to a lot of these questions is going to be frustrating, and I am frustrated,” Reuveni said.\n\nA wife struggles:Trump banished her husband to El Salvador. Work and worry are all she has left.\n\nXinis also questioned the government's claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13.\n\n“In a court of law, when someone is accused in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, complaint, a criminal proceeding that has then a robust process so that we can assess the facts,\" she said. \"I haven’t heard that from the government.\"\n\nWhile the judge sparred with the government's lawyers, Vasquez Sura sat at a table with her family's attorneys, a box of tissues next to her. Afterward, she left the courthouse to applause from supporters who rallied outside to call for her husband's return.\n\n“We will continue this fight to get my husband back,” Vasquez Sura said in brief remarks in Spanish following the judge's decision.\n\nLawyers for the federal government have appealed the case to the4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin Virginia.\n\nWhite House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsuggested Xinis should contact El Salvador President Nayib Bukele \"because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's deportation was complicated by the fact that a court order issued in a separate case six years ago had barred his expulsion.\n\nIn March 2019, he was arrested outside a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he was looking for work, after a confidential informant testified that he was an active member of the MS-13 gang, according to government lawyers. His attorneys say he was not a member of MS-13, and the government offered scant evidence to back up its claim.\n\n'A plain abuse of power\":ICE detains grandmother who hid in churches during first Trump administration\n\nA court ordered him deported to El Salvador, but Abrego Garcia applied for asylum, asking for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In court filings, he said he had come to the United States because the Barrio 18 gang, which is rivals with MS-13, was extorting and threatening him and his family for their pupusa business in their San Salvador neighborhood and pressuring him to join the gang.\n\nA U.S. immigration judge found he was deportable but issued an order in October 2019 that protected him from removal.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s arrest and deportation to El Salvador has been condemned by immigrant rights advocates and others.\n\nMinutes before Friday's hearing, chants led by people in pink vests – reading “Rapid Response Choir” –could be heard from the rally gathered outside the federal courthouse in suburban Maryland. A few police officers stood to the side. The chants, calling for Abrego Garcia's release, continued after the hearing began.\n\nAttorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, who represented the family during the hearing, said they’ve had no contact Abrego Garcia, nor have attorneys the family hired in El Salvador.\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg urged the government to comply with the order to bring Abrego Garcia back. He also said it’d be unlikely Abrego Garcia would get sent to another country, given there’s a court order blocking the administration from deporting people to countries they’re not from.\n\nBut Sandoval-Moshenberg said he wouldn’t declare victory until Abrego Garcia is back in the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia's supporters, however, celebrated the judge's ruling.\n\n“This government tried to disappear Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” said the Rev. Michael Vanacore of Pilgrim United Church of Christ in nearby Wheaton, Maryland. “It was very important to hear his name read aloud in positive judgment by the court, saying that he should be returned.”\n\n'Uncertainty and even fear':Trump's expanded ICE raids are causing big problems for some schools\n\nAt the rally, Vanacore recited a phrase familiar to other Latinos whose loved ones are gone: Saying “presente” after the missing person’s name.\n\n“Kilmar Abrego Garcia, presente,” he said in Spanish, pleading to God for his safe return.\n\nAbrego Garcia's case was one example of the fits and starts the Trump administration has gone through in strengthening immigration enforcement.\n\nA federal judge in the District of Columbia has temporarily blocked the deportation of alleged members of Venezuela's crime gang Tren de Aragua until they have a chance to deny their membership. Three judges in different states have blocked Trump's order denying citizenship to the children of immigrants who have no legal authorization to be in the country.\n\nBen Johnson, executive director of the group American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Friday's ruling will show whether the administration or the courts will correct mistakes in the Trump administration’s policy aiming for mass deportations.\n\n“This is a very big deal because it’s going to tell us whether either the administration is going to follow judicial orders or whether any of the mistakes that the administration makes are irreparable,” Johnson said. “Because the administration is doing so much of this in secret, it’s very hard to know what the remedies are for getting this wrong.”\n\nLinda Dakin-Grimm, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, said the case is significant because the administration is resisting it.\n\n“Other administrations might have just returned the guy and killed the issue,” Dakin-Grimm said.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the Maryland case is how quickly swiftly the judge reached a decision – in days rather than months or years, she said.\n\n“What strikes me is how quickly this happened,” Dakin-Grimm said.",

An immigration judge granted him legal protection from deportation in 2019.\n\nThe White House has alleged Mr Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers argued there is no evidence to prove that he is gang-affiliated.\n\nMr Garcia is one of the 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans whom the Trump administration deported to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot), alleging they were gang members.\n\nBut Mr Garcia's lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says his client has never been charged with a crime in any country and rejected the gang accusation.\n\n\"This was the equivalent of a forcible expulsion,\" Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\nICE officials said Mr Garcia's deportation was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight\".\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security has still argued that the court does not have jurisdiction to order Mr Garcia's return, because he is in El Salvador's custody.\n\nJudge Xinis called Mr Garcia's deportation \"an illegal act\" when issuing her order on Friday. She said he must be returned by Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has stood by its deportations and criticised judges as politically motivated.\n\nIn a post on X, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to Judge Xinis as a \"Marxist\", who \"now thinks she's president of El Salvador\".\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We suggest the Judge contact President [Nayib] Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador.\"\n\nMr Garcia's family, including his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a US citizen, have been calling for his release since his deportation in mid-March.\n\nMs Sura has told reporters that she has not spoken to her husband since he was taken by US authorities.\n\nMr Garcia's lawyer said the claims by the Trump administration that his client could not be returned were \"outrageous\".\n\n\"They're coming before this court and saying, 'We've tried nothing and we're all out of options,'\" Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg told Judge Xinis.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni, who represented the government in court on Friday, acknowledged there were issues with Mr Garcia's deportation. He said he was ''frustrated\" by the lack of answers he was able to provide.\n\nThe government lawyer conceded that Mr Garcia \"should not have been removed\", according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\n\"There is no warrant for his arrest. There is no statement of probable cause,\" Judge Xinis said. \"What is the actual document that got this process started?\"\n\nMr Reuveni said he did \"not have that order. It is not on the record\".\n\nThe justice department lawyer noted that, in his view, \"the government made a choice here to produce no evidence\", adding that this \"absence of evidence speaks for itself\".\n\nThe case has drawn criticism from Democrats, who have accused the Trump immigration authorities of flouting due process.\n\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, wrote on X this week: \"They've admitted to making an error and I urge them to correct it.\"\n\nBut Vice-President JD Vance said this week that Democrats who criticised the Trump administration's deportations have \"gone off the deep end, and they've got to come back to reality\".\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",

He's not some American father as the mainstream media will make you believe, he's actually a member of MS-13, and was involved in trafficking. It's unbelievable the framing of this. Whether this man is in El Salvador or in a U.S. detention center, he should be locked up.\"\n\nAn immigration judge five years ago said Garcia, who came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and asked for asylum, could not be deported to his home country, over concerns he would become a victim of local El Salvador gang members.\n\nHis request for asylum was denied, but he was given protection from deportation and ICE didn't appeal the decision.\n\nGarcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, has vigorously campaigned for his return.\n\nGarcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, has vigorously campaigned for his return.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nGarcia had been working as a sheet metal apprenticein Marylandand was arrested in an IKEA parking lot on March 12 while his 5-year-old son was in the car.\n\nHis lawyers have argued the man had a Department of Homeland Security permit to work in the country, and strongly denied any gang affiliations. They also say that the government has given little evidence to back up its claim.\n\nThere was no indication how the government would comply, since he is incarcerated in an El Salvador prison under that government's custody.\n\nFox News' Cameron Arcand and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
