        "source_1": "The Trump administration announced Monday it will“review” nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard Universityand its affiliates, such as area hospitals, in an effort to “root out antisemitism,” according to the government’s antisemitism task force.\n\nThe announcement comes 10 days after the task force securedextraordinary concessions from Columbia Universityin a similar review that placed nearly $5 billion of that school’s federal funding at risk.\n\nDirectly targeting Harvard is a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s crackdown on elite universities and what it describes as their failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitism and harassment. That campaign also includesarresting and threatening to deport international studentslinked to the pro-Palestinian campus movement, such as aTufts University graduate studentwho wasarrested in Somervillelast week.\n\nIn a message to the campus community Monday night, Harvard president Alan Garber said the government’s review targets “almost $9 billion in support of research.”\n\n“If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation,” he said.\n\nThe task force said it will review more than $255 million in federal contracts with Harvard and its affiliated institutions, as well asmore than $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments.\n\nHarvard’s affiliates include hospitals such as Mass General Brigham and Boston Children’s Hospital. It was not clear Monday evening if funding for those institutions had been targeted in the review. Spokespeople for the hospitals did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration said that elite universities’ alleged failure to protect Jewish students from harassment amounts to a violation of federal civil rights law, which the government can punish by withholding funding. The administration has also asserted its authority to cancel certain contracts at its own discretion without needing to prove any wrongdoing.\n\nSome Jewish advocacy groups have applauded the administration’s efforts, saying they are an innovative and muscular way to combat what they see as rampant campus antisemitism. Roni Brunn, a spokesperson for the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance, said the government’s review is an effort to ensure “antisemitism isn’t created at Harvard, isn’t platformed at Harvard, isn’t elevated at Harvard.”\n\nBut many academics and other Jewish groups have condemned the Trump administration’s efforts as a weaponization of antisemitism to prosecute its wider crackdown on universities, which has included federal research funding cuts, investigations over diversity programs, and a threatened endowment tax hike.\n\nSteven Pinker, a Harvard psychology professor, said, “The gun to the head and shut[ting] down all science seems like a counterproductive way to handle the particular problems of antisemitism.”\n\nPro-Palestinian activists and free speech advocates have described the Trump administration’s targeting of student activists and academics as an unlawful crackdown on political expression.\n\nFor many at Harvard, it had seemed inevitable that the Trump administration would directly target the university. Pinker said he and his colleagues had been “waiting for that shoe to drop,” especially after watching the government target Columbia in recent weeks.\n\nThere, the Trump administration canceled approximately$400 million in federal fundingin early March. Then it sent the university a list of demands, including changes to the school’s rules governing protests and student discipline. It also demanded Columbia place a Middle East studies department under new oversight.\n\nColumbia’s then-president and board of trusteesagreed to nearly all the demandson March 21. The Trump administration described those concessions as a “precondition” for further negotiations over the school’s federal funding. On Friday,Columbia’s board replaced its interim presidentKatrina Armstrong days after she had given private assurances to faculty leaders that the concessions were not as significant as they had seemed, according to press reports, university announcements, and a Columbia professor familiar with the assurances.\n\nMany academics and some university leaders condemned Columbia’s concessions as a dangerous capitulation to government overreach that could encourage the administration to widen its campaign.\n\n“Trump’s attack is not surprising given his authoritarian tendency and past rhetoric,” former Harvard president Lawrence Summers said in an interview Monday evening. Summers has expressed alarm about campus antisemitism, but criticized Trump’s approach to addressing it. “Columbia’s capitulation was unconstructive at best, and I pray Harvard will avoid following their example.”\n\nChristopher Rufo, an influential conservative activist,urged the Trump administration last weekto “export the new Columbia prototype to all universities—starting with those in the Ivy League.”\n\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statementMonday that“Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations.” The school’s “failure to protect students on campus from antisemitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,” she said.\n\n“Harvard can right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus,” she said.\n\nPinker said that Harvard leaders agree the university faces challenges, including concerns about campus antisemitism and ideological diversity among its faculty, and have taken steps in recent months to address those issues.\n\nA top Harvard dean recently announced that the leaders of academic and research centers “have to report on how they’ve been fostering intellectual diversity,” Pinker said.\n\nIn his Monday message, Harvard president Garber, who is Jewish, said antisemitism “is present on our campus” and that he has experienced it “directly, evenwhile serving as president.”\n\n”I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university,” he said. Since he became president last January, however, the school has “devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism,” he said.\n\nChanges are “happening and brewing,” Pinker said, but the Trump directives could complicate matters by making it seem like Harvard is capitulating to government demands, rather than implementing policies and changes that were already in the works.\n\n”It’s all we’ve been talking about for the last two years,” Pinker said.\n\nLauren Perl, a senior at Harvard, said the funding review was worrisome.\n\nPerl, the granddaughter of two Holocaust survivors, has expressed concern about campus antisemitism, especially  after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. But she doubts the sincerity of Trump’s commitment to combating antisemitism and believes his efforts may backfire.\n\nTrump’s moves will “increase persecution against Jewish communities” on campus, she said. ”It’s going to put Jewish students in a hard place where we are going to have to essentially answer for the things that are being done in our name.”\n\nEamon OCearuil, a Harvard senior from North Andover, said Monday’s news signaled to him that the university’s strategy for avoiding Trump’s ire has not worked.\n\n“I’m very worried that the university is going to further capitulate, which is only going to embolden the administration to continue taking away funding from universities,” OCearuil said. “Nothing good is going to happen if they just continue to stay silent.”\n\nA debate has emerged in recent weeks about how university leaders should respond to Trump, with some arguing for unified resistance and others pursuing a more conciliatory approach, including negotiating with the government and making the case to Republican leaders that universities, and especially their research operations, advance the national interest.\n\nHundreds of Harvard professors inan open letterlast week demanded a more confrontational approach.\n\n“You can’t be the biggest player in the room and censor yourself in a moment when everyone has been targeted for attack,” said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a visiting scholar at Harvard who is on sabbatical from Princeton University and who signed the letter.\n\nMike Damiano can be reached atmike.damiano@globe.com.

        "source_2": "Harvard University is the latest target of the Trump administration’s ever-expanding investigation into elite universities.\n\nThe Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and the U.S. General Services Administrationannounced a comprehensive reviewof federal contracts and grants at Harvard and its affiliates as part of the investigations being conducted by the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\nAccording to the news release, the task force will review $255.6 million in contracts between Harvard University, its affiliates and the federal government. The scrutiny will also include more than $8.7 billion in multi-year grant commitments to Harvard University and its affiliates. Which specific grants and contracts will be targeted was not revealed.\n\n“Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations — the pinnacle aspiration for students all over the world to work hard and earn admission to the storied institution,” said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in the press release.\n\n“Harvard’s failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy. Harvard can right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus,” continued McMahon, sounding very much like she had already determined the results of the investigation.\n\nThe announcement of the Harvard probe comes just about two weeks after the Trump administration sent Columbia University a letter demanding several changes it would have to make in order to continue receiving federal funding, including the restoration of $4oo million that was canceledover charges of antisemitism.\n\nThatletterset out nine steps the university had to take “as a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”\n\nWithin a week, Columbia Universityagreedto meet most of the far-ranging demands, which touched on areas such as admissions, academic organization and oversight, student disciplinary procedures, faculty search processes, campus safety, and definitions of antisemitism. Last Friday, the fallout continued when Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, abruptly announced she was stepping down from her position.\n\nMonday’s announcement did not indicate any specific demands that the administration was making of Harvard, but if history is any guide, those are likely to come very soon.\n\nThe federal government will work with relevant contracting agencies \"to assess whether Stop Work Orders should be issued for any identified contracts,” according to the press release. In addition, it directed Harvard to submit a comprehensive list of all contracts for review.\n\n“While Harvard’s recent actions to curb institutionalized antisemitism — though long overdue — are welcome, there is much more that the university must do to retain the privilege of receiving federal taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars,” Josh Gruenbaum, an official with the General Services Administration and a task force member, said in a statement.\n\n“This administration has proven that we will take swift action to hold institutions accountable if they allow antisemitism to fester,” Gruenbaum added. “We will not hesitate to act if Harvard fails to do so.”\n\nHarvard, now squarely in the cross-hairs of the government’s extraordinarily aggressive campaign targeting premier research universities, must decide whether to resist or yield to the new pressure as it seeks to protect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nHundreds of Harvard faculty members signed aletterlast week urging the university to “legally contest and refuse to comply with unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and university self-governance.”But in awritten statementin response to the government’s announcement, Harvard President Alan Garber sounded conciliatory.\n\nNoting that Harvard had “devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism” for the past 15 months, Garber wrote, “We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism.”\n\nAcknowledging that “we are not perfect,” Garber concluded with this: “Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends—and to the teaching and research at the heart of our University—will not waver.”",
        "source_3": "The Trump administration has opened an examination of the government’s financial relationship withHarvard University, an indication that the nation’s richest college could be the next to lose its federal contracts and grants over its handling of campus antisemitism.\n\nThe Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said Monday that it haslauncheda “comprehensive review” into $8.7 billion in multi-year federal grant commitments, as well as $255.6 million in contracts, betweenHarvardand its affiliates.\n\nThe review is intended to ensure thatHarvardis “in compliance with federal regulations, including its civil rights responsibilities,” but it comes as an ill omen for the university, given what happened earlier this month to Columbia University.\n\nThe administration on March 7canceled$400 million in contracts and grants with Columbia over its “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,” culminating Friday in the ouster of Interim President Katrina Armstrong.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon sounded a similar theme withHarvard, blasting its “failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination.”\n\n“Harvardhas served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations – the pinnacle aspiration for students all over the world to work hard and earn admission to the storied institution,” she said in a Monday statement. “Harvard’sfailure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination – all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry – has put its reputation in serious jeopardy.”\n\nShe added that “Harvardcan right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus.”\n\nAfter its contracts were canceled, Columbia agreed on March 21 to the administration’s list of nine demands, including banning masks on campus and hiring more security officers, as a precondition for negotiations on restoring federal funds.\n\nThe agreement spurred outrage on campus. A few days later, Ms. Armstrong told 75 faculty members in a private Zoom meeting that there would be “no change to masking” and other policies, according to a transcript obtained by The Free Press.\n\nMs. ArmstrongresignedFriday, returning to her role as CEO of the university’s medical center. Board of Trustees co-chair Claire Shipman, a former CNN reporter, was named acting president while the board undertakes a search for a permanent president.\n\nThe resignation was the second by a Columbia president in the last nine months. Last August, President Minouche Shafik stepped down amid anti-Israel protest turmoil spurred by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israelis, which prompted Israel to declare war.\n\nThe administration’s joint task force, which includes the Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration, said it would evaluate whether to issue “stop work orders” on specific contracts withHarvard.\n\nHarvardwas also asked to submit a list of all its contracts, both direct and through its affiliates, not included in the initial review.\n\n“The Task Force will continue its efforts to root out anti-Semitism and to refocus our institutions of higher learning on the core values that undergird a liberal education,” said Sean Keveney, HHS Acting General Counsel and task force member. “We are pleased thatHarvardis willing to engage with us on these goals.”\n\nHarvardPresident Alan Garber said the university would “engage” with task force members to make sure “they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions that we will take going forward to combat antisemitism.”\n\nHe also warned that cutting off the nearly $9 billion in federal funding would come at a cost.\n\n“If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation,” Mr. Garber said in a Monday statement.\n\n• Valerie Richardson can be reached atvrichardson@washingtontimes.com.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Washington Times, LLC.Click\n                            here for reprint permission.\n\nPope Leo should tell Catholics: Marry young, have many children\n\nTrump’s TikTok delays undermine his China hawks while Intel controversy grows"
