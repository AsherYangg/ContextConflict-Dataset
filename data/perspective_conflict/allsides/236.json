        "source_1": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has demanded El Salvador release hundreds of Venezuelans who weredeported from the United States, who he described as being “kidnapped,” after his Salvadoran counterpart earlier proposed a prisoner swap.\n\nSpeaking on a television broadcast on Monday, Maduro demanded that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele “provide proof of life for all the kidnapped young people,” allow their families and lawyers to visit the mega-prison where they’re being kept, and to release them “unconditionally.”\n\nHe also urged Bukele to releaseKilmar Abrego Garcia– the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported from the US and remains in El Salvador.\n\nHis comments come after Bukele proposed a prisoner exchange. In a post on X, the Salvadoran president offered to repatriate the 252 Venezuelans currently detained in El Salvador in exchange for “an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners” he says Venezuela holds, including family members of opposition leaders.\n\n“Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, your political prisoners have committed no crime,” Bukele said in the post, directed at Maduro. “The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.”\n\nAmong those “political prisoners” are Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of an exiled opposition presidential candidate; Corina Parisca de Machado, the mother of a Venezuelan opposition leader; a host of journalists, lawyers, and activists; and nearly 50 detained citizens from other countries, including the US.\n\nBukele also proposed swapping four political leaders seeking asylum in theArgentine Embassyin Venezuela. The group has been sheltering at the facility for more than a year, accused of terrorist activities and treason for working with Machado, who says they did nothing wrong.\n\nThe US and El Salvador say most of the deportees locked up in El Salvador’s Cecot prison are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and some are members of the MS-13 Salvadoran gang. But officials have provided scant evidence to show the inmates have ties to those criminal groups, and some of theirrelatives told CNNthat the deportees were not involved in any criminal activity.\n\nSimilarly, the saga of Abrego Garcia has become a critical legal battle in the US. Though the Trump administration admitted he was erroneously deported, it also insists he is a terrorist and member of MS-13 – without offering definitive evidence to prove these claims.\n\nPresident Trump meets with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador at the White House on Monday\n\nRelated cardThe US-El Salvador deportation deal, explained\n\nAbrego Garcia was able to meet with Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen last week during the senator’s visit to El Salvador, after he was initially denied access to Cecot.\n\nMaduro, too, denies that the Venezuelan migrants are criminals and has previously described their incarceration in El Salvador as a “kidnapping”.\n\nTheir detention in El Salvador has caused growing outrage in Venezuela. Earlier Monday, Venezuela’s General Attorney Tarek William Saab also responded to Bukele’s offer by asking for the names and medical status of all of the Venezuelans in Cecot, and accused El Salvador’s government of breaching the human rights of its nationals held in the maximum security facility.\n\nBukele’s proposal comes amid heightened scrutiny about the Salvadoran’s willingness toaccept hundreds of migrantswho the Trump administration claims are gang members or violent criminals.\n\nOne of the region’s most popular leaders, Bukelehas called himself“the world’s coolest dictator” and the “philosopher king” as he suspends certain civil liberties to go after his country’s gangs.\n\nThat has earned him the ire of international human rights organizations, which allege large-scale abuses in his crackdown on crime. But it has also earned him popularity inside El Salvador; Bukele, 43, won reelection last year by a landslide.",
        "source_2": "El Salvador's president has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in his country - if Venezuela releases the same number of political prisoners.\n\nNayib Bukele appealed directly to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a post on social media.\n\nHe said many of the Venezuelan deportees had committed \"rape and murder\", while Venezuelan political prisoners were jailed only because they opposed Maduro, whose re-election last year is widely disputed.\n\nLater Venezuela's chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab criticised Bukele's proposal. He demanded to know what crimes the deportees were accused of, whether they had appeared before a judge or had access to legal counsel.\n\nThe Venezuelan government argues that it has no political prisoners - a claim rejected by rights groups.\n\nIn a post on X, Bukele wrote: \"I want to propose you [Maduro] a humanitarian agreement calling for the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release... of the identical number from among the thousands of political prisoners that you hold\".\n\nHe also mentioned nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap.\n\n​In recent weeks, more than 200 Venezuelans were sent from the US to El Salvador.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration accuses them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.\n\nWashington pays El Salvador to keep those deported in its notorious high-security Terrorism Confinement Center.\n\nBukele calls himself \"the world's coolest dictator\" and won re-election last year riding a wave of popularity for a sweeping anti-gang crackdown.\n\nMaduro has condemned the US deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador, describing it as \"kidnapping\" and a \"massive abuse\" of human rights.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump's hard-line immigration policies have encountered a number of legal hurdles.\n\nIn the latest development,the US Supreme Court on Saturday ordered Washington to pause the deportation of another group of alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n\nThe White House has called challenges to using the law for mass deportations \"meritless litigation\".\n\nTrump has sent accused Venezuelan gang members under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which gives the president power to detain and deport natives or citizens of \"enemy\" nations without usual processes.\n\nThe act was previously used only three times, all during war.\n\nPopulation increases have put the most pressure on vulnerable prisoner accommodation, a report says.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.",
        "source_3": "‘The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud,’ Nayib Bukele wrote in a taunting post to Nicolás Maduro about detainees in Venezuela.\n\nThe self-proclaimed “world’s coolest dictator,” El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, is offering Venezuela’s president a prisoner swap — 252 detainees, including many deported to El Salvador from America, in exchange for 252 of Nicolás Maduro’s political prisoners.\n\nIssuing a lengthy proposal onX, Mr. Bukele appeared to be taunting Mr. Maduro, calling out by name journalists, activists, and relatives of political opponents — including the mother of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado — imprisoned by the Venezuelan president.\n\n“Mr. @NicolasMaduro , you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free. Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don’t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States,” Mr. Bukele wrote.\n\n“Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, your political prisoners have committed no crime.  The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.\n\n“However, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold.”\n\nVenezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab,responded in a statement, calling the proposal “cynical” and demanding to know the status of the prisoners being held in El Salvador.\n\n“I immediately request the complete list with identification of all detainees and their judicial status, as well as proof of life and a medical report on each of the hostages.”\n\nAmid disputes over the validity of Mr. Maduro’s re-election last year, non-governmental organizations say the country has confined more than 800 people for political reasons. Venezuela’s government denies it is holding any political prisoners.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration deported a number of Venezuelan illegal immigrants to El Salvador claiming they are members of the notorious criminal gang Tren de Aragua, which the administration labeled a terrorist organization in February. America is paying $6 million to have them held at the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center.\n\nOver the weekend, the Supreme Court paused the deportation of an additional 18 alleged members of the gang until further notice from the court. The case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union."
