        "source_1": "Allfour living former American presidentspaid tribute on Sunday to the life and legacy ofJimmy Carter, whodied on Sundayatage 100.\n\nThe condolences came fromDonald Trump,the former and future president who is set to be sworn back into the White House next month, as well as Barack Obama, George W. Bush andBill Clinton, who praised Carter for working “tirelessly for a better, fairer world.\"\n\nCarter was the longest living former commander-in-chief in U.S. history, and his relationships with several of his successors put him in a unique position as a role model forpost-presidency life.\n\n\"Carter was quite ambitious on human rights, global public health, election integrity and promoting democracy around the world,\" said Matthew Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University. \"In some ways he was a more political ex-president than many of the other ex-presidents we've had.\"\n\nHere is what the former presidents said about the life and legacy of Carter, the nation's 39th president who served in the White House from January of 1977 to January of 1981.\n\nTrump said Carter tried to \"improve the lives of all Americans\" when he was president despite the challenges he faced.\n\n“Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media website, Truth Social. “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans.\n\n“For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,” wrote Trump, the nation's 45th president and who on January 20 will also become it's 47th president afterwinning a second non-consecutive term this fall.\n\nCarter had initially defended Trump during the Republican's presidency, saying in a 2017 interview how he thought the media had been\"harder on Trump than any other\"White House occupant. But less than a year later, Carter expressed concern about growing racial and other divisions in the U.S. following the 2016 election won by Trump.\n\nDuring a 2018 appearance on \"The Late Show,\" television host Stephen Colbert asked Carter whether America wants \"kind of a jerk as president.\" Carter's reply: \"Apparently, from this recent election, yes.\"\n\nCarter later said Trump ascended to the presidency due to Russian interference, and Trump responded bycalling Carter a \"nice man\" but a \"terrible president.\"\n\nOn Carter's 100th birthday in October, Trumptook aimat his predecessor's time in office, as well as President Joe Biden. Trump said Biden had replaced Carter as the worst president in American history.\n\n\"Jimmy Carter is the happiest man because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison,\" Trump said at a campaign stop in Waunakee, Wisconsin.\n\nIn a second post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump said he \"strongly disagreed\" with Carter philosophically and politically, but that he \"truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for.\"\n\n\"He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect,\" Trump wrote. \"He was a truly good man and, of course, will be greatly missed. He was also very consequential, far more than most Presidents, after he left the Oval Office.\"\n\nObama, the nation's 44th president, praised Carter's \"decency\" while leading the country and after he left the White House.\n\n\"Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did – advocating for the public good, consequences be damned,\" Obama, the country's 45th president, said in a statement. \"He believed some things were more important than reelection – things like integrity, respect, and compassion.\n\n\"Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image,\" added Obama, who served as president from January of 2009 until January of 2017.\n\nEarly in Obama's first term, Carter said during a TV interview that he believed the \"overwhelming portion\" of opposition toward the nation's first Black president was due to his race.\n\n\"And I think it's bubbled up to the surface because of the belief among many white people, not just in the south but around the country, that African Americans are not qualified to lead this great country,\" Carter said in 2009.\n\nThat didn't stop Carter from airing his own disagreements with Obama.\n\nAt one point during Obama's tenure, Carterquestioned the U.S. strategy against the Islamic State, specifically the use of aerial drones. Then in 2014, Carter suggested the Democratic leader was avoiding talking about race, and that it \"might be an embarrassment to President Obama to single out African American people.\" Carter also commented about how Obama never reached out for advice, and that he didn't have his email address.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, Obama said Carter's values led him to choices that made the world better.\n\n\"In doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service,\" Obama said. \"In his Nobel acceptance speech, President Carter said, 'God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.' He made that choice again and again over the course of his 100 years, and the world is better for it.\"\n\nBush, the nation's 43rd president, said Carter \"was a man of deeply held convictions\" and offered his condolences to the Carter family.\n\n\"He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country,\" Bush said in a statement. \"President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.\n\n\"We join our fellow citizens in giving thanks for Jimmy Carter and in prayer for his family,\" Bush said.\n\nHistorians note that Carter and Bush share adeep faith and had \"evangelical\" stylein their presidencies, which they expressed in polar opposite ways.\n\nThat contrast was widely seen in foreign policy. For example, Carter used his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2002, which came during the lead up to the United States' invasion of Iraq, to spotlight his religious beliefs.\n\n“I worship Jesus Christ, whom we Christians consider to be the Prince of Peace,” he said. \"...We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other’s children.\"\n\nBush had reportedly underscored how his faith was a chief engine in deciding to overthrow Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n\n\"I do believe there is an Almighty, and I believe that a gift of that Almighty to all is freedom,\" he told New York Times columnist David Brooks in 2007.\n\nThat same year Carter had blasted the Bush administration's foreign policy decisions, saying that \"as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration has been the worst in history.\" Bush pushed back at the time, saying in response to Carter that going to war was necessary.\n\n“We’re at war with an enemy that is relentless and determined,\" Bush said. \"And it’s essential that the decisions I make protect the American people as best as we can.\"\n\n“Hillary and I mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life,” Clinton, the country's 42nd president, said in a statement on Sunday. “Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others— until the very end.”\n\nClinton's 1992 White House victory marked the first time a Democrat won a presidential election since Carter in 1976. According to Clinton's presidential library, Clinton at the time said he and Carter were, \"as different as daylight and dark.\"\n\nCarter had refused to endorse Clinton during the 1992 Democratic primaries, saying \"people are looking for somebody who is honest and tells the truth.\"\n\nBut during Clinton's White House tenure, the president looked to Carter for help on international matters, such as cooling relations with North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who was attempting to militarize plutonium fuel rods.\n\nIn 1999, Clinton awarded Carter and his wife, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nClinton in his statement also praised Carter for working “tirelessly for a better, fairer world,” highlighting his work on civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia, as well as his efforts as president to protect natural resources and promote energy conservation, return the Panama Canal to Panama and to secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David.",

The two were married for 77 years before Rosalynn died in November 2023, the longest marriage in presidential history. The former first lady reportedly was Jimmy's closest adviser during his presidency and thereafter.\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn, both from Plains, Georgia, wed on July 7, 1946, a year after their first date. In the summer of 1945, Jimmy, then-20 years old, asked Rosalynn, then-17 years old, out to the movies on a whim,Peoplemagazine reported.\n\nJimmy originally popped the question in the winter of 1945, but Rosalynn was concerned about the speed at which their relationship was progressing and wanted to finish her education first, so she said no, according to Biography.com. But in the spring of that year, she agreed to marry him and Jimmy gave her a compact engraved with the letters \"ILYTG,\" which stood for, \"I love you the goodest,\" Biography.com reported.\n\n\"The best thing I ever did was marrying Rosalynn,\" Jimmy said during an interview at The Carter Center in 2015. \"That's the pinnacle of my life.\"\n\nThe pair went onto have four children—Jack, Chip, Jeff, and Amy— as well as 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nJimmy, a Democrat, was elected to the White House in November 1976, thanks to the help of who people called his \"secret weapon,\" Rosalynn, according toPeoplemagazine.\n\nRosalynn toldPeoplein 1976, \"I've made as many as 12 speeches a day in one community. I enjoy it. But sometimes I want to stop and wash my hair.\"\n\nJimmy served one term as president from 1977 to 1981. Jimmy was credited with encouraging a peace agreement in the Middle East that ultimately resulted in the Camp David Accords, which the Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State described as \"historic.\"\n\nThe White House archives lists the Panama Canal treaties and an agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union restricting nuclear weapon production as some of Carter's biggest victories overseas. In the U.S., Carter pursued deregulation in a handful of industries, including energy and transportation, and pushed for new environmental protections. The U.S. Department of Education also launched during his time in office.\n\nRosalynn was also busy in the White House, representing the administration during visits with Central and South American leaders, fundraising for displaced Cambodians, and sponsoring poetry and jazz festivals at the White House. She was also a vocal advocate for mental health, women's rights, and human rights.\n\nIn 1982, Jimmy and Rosalynn created The Carter Center in partnership with Emory University. The former first lady was Carter's \"full partner\" in their efforts at the nonprofit and she also created and chaired its Mental Health Task Force.\n\nThe Carter Center was created \"on a fundamental commitment to human rights and the alleviation of human suffering\" and describes its continuing mission as seeking \"to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health.\"\n\nRosalynn was also president of the board of directors for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, which supports those who care for loved ones with chronic illness and disabilities.\n\nUntil 2020, Jimmy and Rosalynn volunteered one week a year for the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity, which helps renovate and build homes for those in need.\n\nJimmy was recognized \"for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\" with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nRosalynn died at the age of 96on November 19, 2023, while in hospice care at her Plains, Georgia, home, months after The Carter Center announced that shesuffered from dementia.\n\nJimmy, who had been inhospice care since February 2023, died Sunday.\n\nJimmysaid in a statement released by The Carter Center when Rosalynn died, \"Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished.\"\n\nHe added: \"She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.\"\n\nChip Carter, Jimmy and Rosalynn's second eldest son who is now 72 years old, said in a statement released by The Carter Center Sunday, \"My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love.\"\n\nHe continued: \"My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.\"\n\nThere will be public funeral observances for the former president in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., as long as a private interment in Plains, Georgia.
