        "source_1": "President Donald Trump said he told his Cabinet secretaries during a meeting Thursday that staffing decisions will be left up to them, notElon Muskand hisDepartment of Government Efficiency.\n\nTrump said he instructed Cabinet members to work alongside DOGE on spending and workforce reductions while clarifying that final job cuts will be at the discretion of the department leaders.\n\n\"We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one,\" Trumpsaid on Truth Social. \"It’s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it’s also important to keep the best and most productive people.\"\n\n\"As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go. We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'\" Trump added.\n\nThe sweeping cuts carried out by DOGE have led tolawsuits,voter anxietyandheightened concernsfrom congressional Republicans.\n\nTrump’s message was also a rare public curtailing of Musk’s authority as he moves to help reshape the federal government, at times stepping on the Cabinet secretaries’ toes.\n\nSeveral members of Trump’s Cabinetbristled when Musk recently orderedfederal employees to outline their work or face termination, with multiple agencies and departments initially fending off the effort.\n\nAt the same time, Trump also praised Musk and DOGE after Thursday's meeting.\"I think they've done an amazing job,\" he told reporters.\n\nMusk called the meeting \"very productive\" in apost on X.It was his second time attending a Trump Cabinet meeting; hedominated the first gatheringlast month when he called DOGE a “support function” to help the federal agencies “find 15% reduction in fraud and waste.”\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that his directive to his Cabinet members was: “Keep all the people you want, all the people that you need.”\n\nBut he also indicated that Musk would step in if the department heads don’t make sufficient cuts.\n\n\"If they can cut, it’s better. If they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting,” Trump said.\n\nTrump and Musk have sought to drastically cut the size of the federal workforce, firingthousands of employeesand moving toshutter entire agencies.\n\nThespeed and intensityof the cuts have roiled some Republican members of Congress and sparked calls for greater transparency into DOGE's work, particularly after some lawmakers facedfierce backlashfrom people at town halls in their districts.\n\nMusk met with Senate Republicans for nearly two hours behind closed doors Wednesday to address their concerns over potential voter backlash to the cuts.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., organized the lunch meeting after several Republican senatorsraised concerns to White House chief of staff Susie Wileslast month about being uninformed on DOGE's work.\n\nMusk also met with House Republicans on Wednesday, later telling reporters that he spoke about the “opportunity to improve expenditures in the government.”\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.",
        "source_2": "President Donald Trump told his Cabinet secretaries they should make final decisions on staffing and cost-cutting measures rather than billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, Politicoreports, a move that could help shield the Trump administration in court as it fights multiple lawsuits challenging Musk’s apparent authority.\n\nTrump told Cabinet secretaries Thursday that ultimate decisions on “personnel, policy and the pacing of implementation” at their agencies are up to them, Politico reported citing anonymous sources, saying Musk and his DOGE team can make “recommendations” but do not have any power to make “unilateral decisions.”\n\nThe president confirmed he met with agency heads and Musk in a Truth SocialpostThursday, saying the meeting was “very positive” and that he told them “to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing.”\n\nMusk agreed with Trump’s directive to defer to agency officials on staffing during the meeting Thursday, Politico reports, with one source telling the outlet that Musk acknowledged DOGE had made “missteps” in how it handled widespread government spending and staffing cuts.\n\nTrump’s meeting was reportedly spurred by concerns from lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries about Musk usurping authority over federal agencies, Politico reports, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., tellingCNNearlier this week that Musk needs “to pay attention to the aftermath of” his mass government firings “and how it impacts people,” also suggesting lawmakers and Cabinet officials are “probably better-attuned” to make decisions.\n\nThe president’s directive could also play an important role for the administration in court, wheremultiple lawsuitsare taking aim at Musk’s authority and suing DOGE over worker firings, prompting the government to claim incourt filingsthat Musk does not have decision-making authority—but struggle to articulate in court what the billionaire’s role exactly is.\n\nThe legal debate over Musk’s role in the White House ramped up after Trump declared in his address to the joint session of Congress Tuesday that DOGE is “headed by Elon Musk,”promptingplaintiffs in lawsuits against DOGE to file court briefs citing Trump’s comments as evidence that Musk is connected to DOGE’s actions and thus should be held liable.\n\nTrump in comments to reporters Thursday suggested Musk still has some authority over the firing of federal workers, when asked about his meeting with Cabinet secretaries. The president said he told agency heads to “go first” on making staffing decisions and “keep all the people that you need,” but added, “Elon and the group will be watching them, and if they can cut, it’s better, and if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.”\n\nThe Trump administration has claimed in court filings that Musk has “no greater authority than other senior White House advisors” and can’t “make government decisions himself,” alleging Musk “can only advise the President and communicate the President’s directives.” The government has also claimed Musk is not an “employee of the U.S. DOGE Service” or the “U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,” but struggled to identify who the agency’s administrator actually was. The White House eventually named Amy Gleason as the administrator, after facing repeated questioning about who was in that role, though a lawyer for the Trump administrationsaidin court Feb. 28 that he “was not able to get an answer” about who was leading DOGE prior to Gleason being named or responses to other questions about the department’s leadership. That prompted Judge Theodore Chuang to express skepticism about what the administration has claimed in court,saying, “The plaintiffs are saying Musk was the head of DOGE. You’re saying he wasn’t, but we can’t tell you who was, which admittedly is highly suspicious.”\n\nNumerous lawsuits are still pending regarding DOGE’s authority, with cases targeting DOGE’s access to data at specific agencies and the department and Musk’s overall authority. A new lawsuit filed by advocacy groups Wednesday claims Musk has led a “lawless, unchecked evisceration of the federal government.” Trump’s claim to agency heads that they, rather than Musk, have ultimate authority over their agency’s staffing and policy decisions could help shield the Trump administration from losing those cases, which ask courts for relief that ranges from blocking DOGE from specific government databases to declaring DOGE was unlawfully established and ending its work.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Cabinet officials could take a more nuanced approach to staffing and spending decisions than the widespread cuts DOGE has made—some of which they’ve had to walk back, after firing essential employees or ending critical government work. Politico reports Trump told Cabinet secretaries Thursday he wants to “keep good people in government and not eject capable federal workers en masse,” with Trump saying on Truth Social that agency heads “can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go.” “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet,’” Trump wrote. It’s still unclear if that could result in any changes to plannedstaffing cutsat agencies like theDepartment of Veterans Affairsand Securities and Exchange Commission, or reverse any layoffs that have already taken place.\n\nTrump’s meeting with Cabinet secretaries comes after Musk similarly met Wednesday with Republican lawmakers, where he reportedly vowed to improve communications with Congress about DOGE’s actions and gave his personal cell phone number out to lawmakers. The meeting was held at House Speaker Mike Johnson’s request as GOP lawmakers have faced blowback from constituents about DOGE’s actions, The Washington Postreports, with Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., saying before the meeting that members of Congress are the “ones that have to go home and defend these decisions, not [Musk]. So why don’t you give them a heads-up.”\n\nMusk and DOGEhave drawn widespread criticism for enacting significant cuts across the federal government as the department carries out its mission of rooting out purported government waste. The moves resulted in thousands of federal workerslosing their jobsand cuts to both domestic and foreign federal spending, with Musk and DOGE being linked to the dismantling of federal agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Musk, the richest man in the world and one of Trump’stop election donors, has also drawn widespread scrutiny as he’s taken a top role in the White House, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office and publicly claiming credit for DOGE’s government work. The lawsuits against DOGE’s work are a fraction of dozens oflegal challengesthat have been brought against the Trump administration since the inauguration, which have resulted in a number of rulings pausing federal policies, though most lawsuits remain ongoing.",
        "source_3": "President Trumprevealed plans for cabinet secretaries and other high-level administration officials to hold more sway in theDepartment of Government Efficiency’spush for personnel cuts.\n\nCabinet officials will meet with DOGE every two weeks until the administration has wrapped up its efforts torevamp the federal workforce, Trump announced, while lauding special government employee Elon Musk’s efforts as “an incredible success.”\n\n“Now that we have my cabinet in place, I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing,” Trumpannounced on Truth Social.\n\n“As the Secretaries learn about and understand the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain and who will go. “\n\nThroughout the first six weeks of his administration, DOGE has made a dizzying array of sporadic cuts to personnel and programs.\n\nIn some instances, the administration has been forced to reverse course on those cuts. Last month, for example, the National Nuclear Security Administration scrambled to rehire regulators that had been let go.\n\nLater in February, the White House undid a roughly 20% cut to staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program following an outcry from Staten Island GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and other NYC-area lawmakers.\n\n“We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet,’” Trump emphasized in his post. “The combination of them, Elon, DOGE, and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level.”\n\nTrump’s announcement comes on the heels of a closed-door meeting that most cabinet secretaries attended with Musk.\n\n“It was a very positive one,” Trump said of the meeting. “It’s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it’s also important to keep the best and most productive people.”\n\nThe president had crowed about some of DOGE’s cost-cutting achievements during his annual presidential address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.\n\nMusk later followed up on X and hailed it as a “very productive meeting,” downplaying the fact that the president had seemingly limited his powers. Trump later reiterated to reporters that DOGE has “done an amazing job.”\n\n“I want the cabinet members to keep good people. I don’t want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut,” he reiterated to White House reporters on Thursday.\n\n“I want the cabinet members go first, keep all the people you want, everybody that you need,” he added. “I want them to do the best job they can where we have good people, those that’s precious.”\n\nDemocrats have pummeled the Trump administration over DOGE’s crusade to trim down the federal bureaucracy — and have touted town hall events in which Republican lawmakers have weathered backlash from their constituents as well as union leaders and Democratic allies.\n\nDespite the blowback,Trump has stood by Musk and mused that critics are trying topit the two billionaires against one another.\n\nTop brass in the administration had seemed uncomfortable with Musk’s antics at times. Last month, he directed an Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) email to be sent out to government workers, instructing them to list five accomplishments from the prior week.\n\nNumerous secretaries and agency heads initially instructed their workers to refrain from responding, fearing that DOGE may be using replies to make personnel decisions. Musk later claimed that it was merely a “pulse check.”\n\nMusk met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday. After the meeting, multiple senators suggested that the tech baron was keen on a rescissions package in which the government would claw back funding.\n\n“It is now time for the White House to put together a rescissions package so that Congress can turn DOGE’s work product into law and save money for the American people,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said after the meeting.\n\nDuring those meetings, Musk also acknowledged that DOGE has made mistakes.\n\n“He said you know, there’s going to be mistakes along the way. He has said that publicly before too,” Rep. Russell Fry (R-SC) told CNN. “And then when those are identified, they will be corrected.”"
