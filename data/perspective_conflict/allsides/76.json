        "source_1": "Joshua Aaron has worked in and around the tech industry for around two decades. He built his first app — a blackjack game — at computer camp when he was 13.\n\nHis newest app is designed for a very different purpose: to let users alert people nearby to sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their area.\n\nAaron launched the platform, called ICEBlock, in early April after watching President Donald Trump’s administration begin itsimmigration crackdown. The White House’s immigration policies have sparked mass protests across the United States; aCNN pollin April showed 52% of Americans polled said Trump has gone too far in deporting undocumented immigrants.\n\nICEBlock currently has more than 20,000 users, many of whom are in Los Angeles, where controversial, large-scale deportation efforts have taken place.\n\n“When I saw what was happening in this country, I wanted to do something to fight back,” Aaron told CNN, adding that the deportation efforts feel, to him, reminiscent of Nazi Germany. “We’re literally watching history repeat itself.”\n\nICEBlock is designed to be an “early warning system” for users when ICE is operating nearby, Aaron said. Users can add a pin on a map showing where they spotted agents — along with optional notes, like what officers were wearing or what kind of car they were driving. Other users within a five-mile radius will then receive a push alert notifying them of the sighting.\n\nRelated articleExclusive: New Trump administration plan could end asylum claims and speed deportations for hundreds of thousands of migrants\n\nAaron said he hopes those notifications will help people avoid interactions with ICE, noting that he does not want users to interfere with the agency’s operations. The app provides a similar warning when users log a sighting: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.”\n\nICE did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the app or Aaron’s characterization of the agency’s activity prior to this story’s publication. On Monday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons released a statement criticizing CNN’s report and saying that ICEBlock “basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers’ backs” and that “officers and agents are already facing a 500% increase in assaults.”\n\nICEBlock doesn’t collect personal data, and users are completely anonymous, according to Aaron. It’s only available on iOS because Aaron says the app would have to collect information that could ultimately put users at risk to provide the same experience on Android.\n\nReassuring users of those privacy protections will likely be key to growing ICEBlock’s user base, given how the government is building adatabaseto aid in its deportation efforts.\n\n“We don’t want anybody’s device ID, IP address, location,” Aaron said. “We don’t want anything being discoverable. And so, this is 100% anonymous and free for anybody who wants to use it.”\n\nAlthough ICEBlock has no surefire way of guaranteeing the accuracy of user reports, Aaron says he’s built safeguards to prevent users from spamming the platform with fake sightings. Users can only report a sighting within five miles of their location, and they can only report once every five minutes. Reports are automatically deleted after four hours.\n\nAaron says he has no plans to monetize the free app but rather wants it to be a service to the community.\n\nAaron’s work on ICEBlock stands in contrast to the support that some leaders in Silicon Valley have shown to Trump, including by donating to and attending his inauguration. Some companies have also announced investments in expanding their US presence following the president’s push for domestic tech manufacturing.\n\n“I think I would say grow a backbone. You can’t just be about the money,” Aaron said when asked what he would say to those tech leaders.\n\n“I understand that you have shareholders to report to. I understand that you have employees that need their paychecks,” he added. “But at what point do you say, ‘Enough is enough’?”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional content.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe designer of an app that allows users totrack the location of immigration officerscompared the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement with \"Hitler's rise to power\" in Nazi Germany.\n\nJoshua Aaron, the creator of ICEBlock, toldNewsweekthat he \"knew something had to be done to help the people\" after researchingProject 2025and seeing images ofICEagents detaining people.\n\nNewsweekhas contacted theDepartment of Homeland Securityfor comment via email.\n\nThe ICEBlock app allows users to access and update a real-time map of ICE activity across the U.S. It became the top download on the App Store in the social networking category this week.\n\nAaron created it with the goal of helping people avoid encounters with ICE, and he has said repeatedly that it is not designed to interfere with law enforcement. However, the Department of Homeland Security has said the app \"paints a target on federal law enforcement officers' backs.\"\n\nWhile Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemhas called ICEBlock an \"obstruction of justice,\" Aaron maintains that the app is solely for information.\n\n\"I have continually made it clear, both via wording in the app and through media, that this is an early warning system. In no way are we encouraging ICEBlock users to interfere with law enforcement,\" he toldNewsweek.\n\nAaron continued: \"When I read Project 2025, listened to Trump on the campaign trail and then saw his administration putting policies into place to achieve those goals, I knew something had to be done to help the people.\n\n\"When we see ICE agentsoutside of elementary schools, disappearing college students for their political beliefs or ripping babies from their mother's arms as they scream for their children, we all know their rhetoric of 'getting rid of the worst of the worst' is a lie.\n\n\"As I often say, if you ever wondered what you would've done if you lived in Germany during Hitler's rise to power, wonder no more because you're doing it right now. Developing ICEBlock was my way of joining the fight and giving people a chance to help protect themselves and their communities.\"\n\nAnonymity is key to the app's success. ICEBlock does not log any user information or location data. This means that estimates for the app's usage, which already put it as one of the most popular services this week, are likely even higher.\n\n\"As of June 29, we had 31.3k users,\" Aaron said. \"Now that ICEBlock is the No. 1 app in social networking—and with all the media attention, I have a feeling that number will be significantly larger.\"\n\n\"As far as the areas in which the user base in the largest, I would have no idea,\" he added. \"We do not track our users at any time, and that includes analytics. There is literally no data about any user captured or stored, ever.\"\n\nTodd M. Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement given toNewsweekfollowing a CNN segment about ICEBlock on Tuesday: \"Advertising an app that basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers' backs is sickening.\n\n\"My officers and agents are already facing a 500 percent increase in assaults, and going on live television to announce an app that lets anyone zero in on their locations is like inviting violence against them with a national megaphone.\n\n\"CNNis willfully endangering the lives of officers who put their lives on the line every day and enabling dangerous criminal aliens to evade U.S. law. Is this simply reckless 'journalism' or overt activism?\"\n\nA statement on the ICEBlock app tells users: \"Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.\"\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X, formerly Twitter: \"This sure looks like obstruction of justice. Our brave ICE law enforcement face a 500 percent increase in assaults against them. If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nICE continues to carry out the Trump administration's immigration orders across the U.S.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nTheo Burman is a Newsweek Live News Reporter based in London, U.K. He writes about U.S. politics and international news, with a focus on infrastructure and technology.

        "source_3": "(TNND) —There is a new crowdsourcing App that enables users to track the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is not happy about it. She saw a report on CNN about it and posted to her X account, \"This sure looks like obstruction of justice,\" she wrote. \"Our brave ICE law enforcement face a 500% increase in assaults against them. If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThe ICEBlock App, launched in April, lets users anonymously report locations of agents in real time, described as helping people avoid contact with ICE agents. Users can mark locations on a map and add notes like vehicle descriptions or uniforms. According to the App you must be in a five mile radius of an ICE agent to receive alerts.\n\nThe App is currently available in the IOS App store but no word on how long it will be available if it is in fact found to be illegal and an obstruction of justice."
