        "source_1": "The administration tried to block multibillions in funding for noncompliance.\n\nHarvard University is suing President Donald Trump's administration for threatening to withhold federal funding if the school did not comply with its list of demands.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, asks a judge to block the funding freeze from going into effect, arguing the move is \"unlawful and beyond the government's authority.\"\n\nIn it, lawyers for the university argue that the administration is unlawfully using billions of dollars in federal funding as \"leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard.\"\n\nThey also allege that the funding freeze violates the First Amendment, flouts federal law and threatens life-saving medical research.\n\n\"All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,\" Harvard's lawyers wrote.\n\nEarlier this month, following the school's refusal to budge on the government's demands, the administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism – alleging the school has failed to confront antisemitism on campus – froze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts, and it reportedly plans to pull an additional $1 billion in funding for medical research.\n\nThe decision followed Harvard University President Alan Garber'sletter on April 14, which said that the school \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights\" by agreeing to a series of terms proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe lawsuit is the school's latest effort to push back against the administration's threats.\n\n\"The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,\" the lawsuit said. \"Nor has the Government acknowledged the significant consequences that the indefinite freeze of billions of dollars in federal research funding will have on Harvard's research programs, the beneficiaries of that research, and the national interest in furthering American innovation and progress.\"\n\nIn addition to arguing the funding freeze violates the First Amendment, Harvard's lawyers alleged the Trump administration failed to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which sets out a series of procedures needed before funding can be frozen.\n\n\"The Government made no effort to follow those procedures—nor the procedures provided for in Defendants' own agency regulations—before freezing Harvard's federal funding,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe school asked a federal judge to declare the funding freeze unlawful, block it from taking effect and enjoin the government unilaterally freezing furniture funding without following the steps laid out by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nGarber announced the lawsuit in a letter published to the school's website on Monday, saying the administration's demands sought to impose \"unprecedented and improper control\" over the university.\n\n\"Doubling down on the letter's sweeping and intrusive demands—which would impose unprecedented and improper control over the University—the government has, in addition to the initial freeze of $2.2 billion in funding, considered taking steps to freeze an additional $1 billion in grants, initiated numerous investigations of Harvard's operations, threatened the education of international students, and announced that it is considering a revocation of Harvard's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status,\" Garber's statement said.\n\n\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers, and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" it continued.\n\nThe Trump administration has also cut funding at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern -- with Harvard being the most high-profile and first university to explicitly refuse the government's demands.\n\n\"Today, we stand for the values that have made American higher education a beacon for the world. We stand for the truth that colleges and universities across the country can embrace and honor their legal obligations and best fulfill their essential role in society without improper government intrusion,\" Garber said in his statement announcing the lawsuit on Monday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nHarvard University announced Monday that it is suing the Trump administration in federal court, seeking to block a freeze on more than $2.2 billion in research grants.\n\nThe move follows Harvard's refusal to comply with a series of sweeping demands from the administration, which included limiting campus activism, altering admissions policies, and restructuring university governance. According to Harvard, the freeze came just hours afterthe university said it would not acquiesce to the government's orders.\n\nEarlier this month, PresidentDonald Trump's administration sent a letter to Harvard outlining its demands, which included increased disciplinary actions against campus protesters, screening international students for \"hostility to American values,\" and requiring audits to assess ideological diversity among faculty and students. The letter also called for broad leadership changes and the derecognition of some student clubs.Harvard President Alan Garber pushed back strongly,declaring that the university would not \"bend to the government's demands.\"\n\nIn its 51-page complaint, filed in U.S. district court in Boston, Harvard accuses the Trump administration of retaliatory overreach, stating, \"The Government has not — and cannot — identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation.\"\n\nThe university also argued that the funding freeze would severely damage academic research efforts, writing, \"Nor has the Government acknowledged the significant consequences that the indefinite freeze of billions of dollars in federal research funding will have on Harvard's research programs, the beneficiaries of that research, and the national interest in furthering American innovation and progress.\"\n\nIn an emailed response toNewsweekMonday night, White House spokesman Harrison Fields said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"\n\nFollowing Harvard's refusal to comply,President Trump posted on Truth Social,questioning whether the university should retain its tax-exempt status \"if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\"\n\nThe administration has also threatened to bar Harvard from enrolling international students, escalating tensions further.\n\nHarvard frames the legal battle as a broader defense of academic freedom in the U.S., warning that the administration's demands threaten not only Harvard but the constitutional autonomy historically granted to American universities.\n\nGarber told the Harvard community,\"Today, we stand for the values that have made American higher education a beacon for the world. That is how we achieve academic excellence, safeguard open inquiry and freedom of speech, and conduct pioneering research—and how we advance the boundless exploration that propels our nation and its people into a better future.\"\n\nNewsweeksenior editor at-largewrote in a recent commentary,\"Trump, in seeking to condition federal taxpayer grants to elite universities like Columbia and Harvard on the universities' bare-minimum compliance with the nation's civil rights laws, is taking the smallest step possible to recalibrate the discombobulated quid quo pro that has defined the taxpayer-university relationship for decades.\"\n\nThe clash is putting serious strain on the traditionally cooperative relationship between the federal government and universities that rely on federal funding to drive scientific research and innovation. Once viewed as a vital investment in the public good, that funding has now become a powerful tool of leverage for the Trump administration.\n\nReporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nUpdate: 4/21/25, 6:25 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and remarks.\n\nUpdate: 4/21/25, 8 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and remarks from the White House.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor atNewsweekbased in North Carolina.

        "source_3": "Harvard Universityfiled a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it pulled over $2 billion in federal funding to the Ivy League institution over accusations the school is not doing enough to targetantisemitism.\n\nIn the 51-page complaint filed in a U.S. district court on Monday, Harvard argued that the Trump administration’s $2.2 billion freeze was unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment by “imposing viewpoint-based conditions on Harvard’s funding.”\n\n“The tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution’s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,” the university wrote in its lawsuit.\n\n“The Government has not — and cannot — identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America’s position as a global leader in innovation,” the lawsuit added.\n\nHarvard hasrejected the Trump administration’s demandsto make changes in its approach to combating antisemitism afterinitially acquiescingto some of the administration’s requests.\n\nEarlier this month, Harvard President Alan Garber’s lawyers sent a letter to the White House refusing requests to further crack down on antisemitism due to concerns the federal government’s demands violated the Ivy League institution’s First Amendment rights. In turn, the administration responded by pulling $2.2 billion in multiyear grants to Harvard.\n\nThe Trump administration’s targeting of Harvard and other leading U.S. universities comes after pro-Palestinian protests have rocked the institution and other college campuses since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nClaudine Gay stepped down as president of Harvard in January 2024 in part over backlash to her response to allegations of antisemitism on campus and her waffling during a congressional hearingover whether calling for the genocide of Jewsviolated Harvard’s rules on bullying and harassment.\n\nWHY DOES HARVARD HAVE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS, AND CAN TRUMP’S IRS REVOKE IT?\n\nHowever, the Trump administration’s approach to targeting universities over their handling of protests has raised eyebrowson both sides of the aisledue to concerns the tactics infringe on free speech rights guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\n“Racism and antisemitism are both evil and must be opposed,” loyal Trump ally Charlie Kirk said earlier this month. “But a government organized around jailing, impoverishing, or silencing people based on ‘racism’ is what our enemies wanted. We should not repeat their mistakes just because some keffiyeh-wearing communists are protesting on campuses.”\n\n“America’s free speech tradition is our birthright. We should never get rid of it,” he continued. “The First Amendment and our strict freedom of speech is one of America’s greatest rights and sets us apart from every other country in the world.”"
