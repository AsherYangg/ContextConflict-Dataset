        "source_1": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a joint statement “further deepening” their partnership following talks in Moscow Thursday – a show of solidarity in the face of global uncertainties unleashed by US President Donald Trump’s “America First” diplomacy.\n\nSeated together in an ornate room in the Kremlin following roughly four hours of talks, the two leaders inked what Chinese state media said was a“joint statement on further deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.” Putin and Xitypically release lengthy and wide-ranging joint statements following their regular meetings.\n\nIn remarks afterward, both leaders looked to frame their relationship asa key force for defending and improving the world order – contrary toWestern characterizationsof the partnership and even as Russia continues its brutal, years-long invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“In today’s challenging geopolitical situation and global uncertainty, the Russia-China foreign policy partnership is a key stabilizing factor on the international stage,” Putin said, according to a Kremlin readout. “Together, we defend the formation of a more just and democratic multipolar world order.”\n\nSpeaking after Putin, Xi described the two countries as “stable, positive, and progressive forces in the international community” and called for them to work together to “lead global governance in the right direction, and promote inclusive economic globalization that benefits all” – comments that come as the US has exited several United Nations bodies and roiled markets with threats of a global trade war.\n\nEarlier in the day, Xi employed language typically used by Beijing to criticize Washington, saying Russia and China had “special responsibilities” in the face of “an international countercurrent of unilateralism and the hegemonic practices of the powerful.”\n\nXi arrived Wednesday for afour-day state visit to Russia, where he’ll top a list of foreign leaders attending Putin’s heavily choreographed Victory Day military parade, which is taking place in the shadow of Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine. This year’s events mark 80 years since the Allied victory over Nazi Germany, which ended World War II.\n\nThe visit takes placeamid uncertainty for countries around the world as the Trump administration upends traditional US foreign policy, while China and Russia – who have significantly tightened their ties in recent years – have both also seen substantial changes in their respective relationships with Washington.\n\nThe US and China are mired in an escalated trade war, sparked by Trump’s heavy tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy. Moscow, meanwhile, has found a more sympathetic America under Trump than it did during Joe Biden’s presidency, but is nowwarily eying recently warming tiesbetween Washington and Kyiv.\n\nDespite this shifting landscape, both leaders appeared keen to project their unity in their meeting.\n\nAhead of Xi’s arrival, Putin referred to him as his “main guest” at the Victory Day events. The Russian leader on Thursday morning welcomed Xi with ceremony to the Kremlin, where the two shook hands in a cavernous hall before posing for photos flanked by oversized Chinese and Russian flags.\n\nDuring opening remarks, each referred to the other as a “friend,” while Xi described their relationshipas “composed and confident, stable and resilient.”\n\nThe two leaders have met more than 40 times over the past decade as they steadily strengthened their partnership in recent years in the face of shared tensions with the West.\n\nPutin said the two leaders had inThursday’s joint statementset out “ambitious goals,” highlighting their deepening economicand technological ties and plans to ensure “significant qualitative advancement of Russian-Chinese trade and investment by 2030.”\n\n“Daily work continues to maintain positive trade dynamics,” Putin said, adding that Russia has become the world’s leading importer of Chinese automobiles. “At the same time, we welcome the establishment of manufacturing and the transfer of Chinese industrial expertise to our country,” he said.\n\nThe two countries reached record trade last year, as China emerged as a key economic lifeline for a sanctions-strapped Russia as it wages war on Ukraine. Western leaders have accused China of powering Russia’s offensivewith dual-use exports, a charge Beijing denies.\n\nThe Russian market has become even more important for Chinese exporters, however, as they scramble to expand business in other markets after Trump’s imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the US.\n\nXi said the two countries’ pact “injected new momentum into the development of China-Russia relations” and praised the “leap forward” in those relations over the past decade, despite “great turbulence and changes in the international situation.”\n\nAs they concluded talks, the two sides also signed over 20 documents, covering areas such as global stability, maintaining the authority of international law, biosecurity, investment protection, digital economy, quarantine inspection, and film cooperation.\n\nThe meeting takes place hours after athree-day ceasefire in Ukraine— unilaterally declared by Putin last month — came into effect, coinciding with the parade. Russian state news agency Tass said the ceasefire began at midnight local time on Wednesday (5 p.m. ET Wednesday).\n\nHowever, Ukraine’s air force claimedthat, overnight, Russia launched guided bombs over the city ofSumy in northeastern Ukraine. CNN could not independently verify the claim.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned dignitaries traveling to the event that Kyiv “cannot be responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,” amid the ongoing conflict, a statement the Kremlin said amounted to a threat.\n\nRelated articlePutin’s 3-day ceasefire comes into effect, but Ukraine claims Russia already broke it\n\nUkraine has launched multiple drone attacks on Moscow over the course of the war, including in recent days, prompting temporary closures of airports in the capital for several hours. Ukraine says its attacks are in response to Russia’s continued assault on Ukrainian territory, including residential areas and energy infrastructure.\n\nMore than two dozen leaders are expected to gather in the Russian capital for the Victory Day celebrations, while troops from 13 countries will march in the parade, according to the Kremlin. Leaders expected to attend include Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Belarussian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko.\n\nThe gathering, a key chance for Putin to project himself as a global power player, takes place amidan increasingly contentious global backdrop, includingtensions between India and Pakistanwhich threaten to spiral into a full-blown conflict.\n\nRussia’s May 9 Victory Day is one of the country’s largest celebrations. It marks Nazi Germany’s 1945 surrender to the Soviet Union, a day which has become increasingly important under Putin, who has falsely claimed his war in Ukraine is a “denazification.” In recent years the parade has seen a diminished supply of military hardware, as Russian tanks are instead mobilized on that war’s front lines.\n\nEurope celebrates its VE Day, marking Germany’s surrender on all fronts, on Thursday.\n\nCNN’s Darya Tarasova and CNN’s Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

They will also have confidential one-on-one talks.\n\nXi's presence in Russia for Victory Day—an important date in the Russian calendar that carries a lot of emotional weight—and his grand reception by Putin is intended to symbolize the strength and significance of their relationship.\n\nRussia is the junior partner to the more powerful China, which is the world's second-largest economy, though Moscow is keen to present it as a relationship of equals.\n\nIn the early months of the Ukraine war, Xi and Putin had declared a \"partnership without limits\" between Russia and China, but the latter has sought to stay out of direct involvement in the conflict.\n\nPutin declared a unilateral 36-hour truce with Ukraine to coincide with Victory Day, at which other world leaders will be in attendance, including Xi.\n\nUkraine said it wants a full 30-day ceasefire instead, and PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyhas said Russia should worry about its parade in Moscow.\n\nXisaid to Putin, per TASS: \"Under our strategic leadership, our political interaction is strengthening, practical cooperation is consolidating, cultural, humanitarian, exchange and interregional ties are gaining momentum.\"\n\nPutinsaid: \"We are developing our ties for the benefit of the peoples of both countries and not against anyone. The intention to build good-neighborliness, strengthen friendship and expand cooperation is the choice of Russia and China based on strategic cooperation.\"\n\nDaniel Fried, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told POLITICO: \"I hope that this will put an end to the fatuous notion that the United States can pull what amateurs call a 'reverse Kissinger' and entice Russia away from China. That's always been nonsense. The Chinese alliance validates Putin's worldview that the free world order is on the defensive and maybe dead because of [President Donald] Trump, and it could be replaced by a different order in which Russia is a founding member, if not an equal member.\"\n\nPutin is likely to also visit China for its celebrations to mark 80 years since victory over Japan. \"I will be glad to visit friendly China again on an official visit timed to coincide with this date,\" Putin said.\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.
