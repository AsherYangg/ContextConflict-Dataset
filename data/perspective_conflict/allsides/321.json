It's also the biggest test for Syria's new government since it has assumed power.\n\nOn Sunday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rightsreportedthat 830 civilians have been killed, along with 231 Syrian security forces and 250 Alawite militants. The figures could not be independently verified.\n\nThe Observatory characterized many of the killings as executions and massacres, carried out in revenge against the Alawite community, which made up Assad's traditional base of support. The human rights group also reported burning of homes and forced displacement, worsened by the absence of international intervention.\n\nThis aerial view shows members of security forces loyal to the interim Syrian government standing along a rocky beaech by Mediterranean sea coast in Syria's western city of Latakia on March 9.Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\n\nThe fighting broke out on Thursday near the coast afterreportsthat Alawite gunmen ambushed and killed 16 government forces in the coastal province of Latakia.\n\nIn response, the government sent reinforcements to and imposed curfews on Latakia and neighboring Tartus.\n\nAt first, the casualties mainly involved those fighting on both sides, according to the Observatory'sreports. But as clashes went on, the civilian death toll skyrocketed, with many peopleshot at close range.\n\nPart of the issue has been theinvolvementof other armed groups, who have sought to punish the Alawite sect for their previous support of the former regime.\n\nAlawite leaders said their community around Latakia and Tartus have been the target of attacks for weeks, ever since the Assad regime was overthrown, NPR previouslyreported.\n\nPeople lift placards during a rally called for by Syrian activists \"to mourn for the civilian and security personnel casualties,\" at al-Marjeh square in Damascus on March 9.AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption\n\nThe human rights group said the Alawite gunmen loyal to the former regime do not represent the Alawite community, and many Alawite residents desperately want peace.\n\nThe new government is led by the rebel group responsible for ousting the Assad regime, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group's leader and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa has repeatedly pledged that the government will protect all minorities, a promise that hasproved to be difficult, especially with the Alawites, in part because the government does not officially have a police force or army.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSyria is experiencing its deadliest period since the ousting of longtime PresidentBashar al-Assadthree months ago, as clashes have erupted between government forces and pro-al Assad fighters this week, leaving hundreds of civilians and fighters dead.\n\nSince Thursday, more than 1,000 people—including Christian minorities and Alawites, the sect to which Assad belongs—have been killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) and local reports.\n\nNewsweekhas reached out to Syria's permanent representative to theUnited Nationsand Syria's Ministry of Information for comment via email on Saturday evening.\n\nThe death toll from clashes that began late this week between security forces and al-Assad loyalists, as well as subsequent revenge killings, has climbed to more than 1,000, according to the SOHR, a war monitoring group, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nSyria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has vowed the new government will respect all communities and affiliations. He is working to gain international legitimacy and has recently met with regional leaders. However, this intense violence could undermine those efforts.\n\nSyria has been mired in conflict for more than a decade, with the Syrian Civil War beginning in 2011, which included widespread human rights violations, sectarian violence, mass killings and displacement, as well as intense battles againstISISfactions.\n\nThe recent fatal clashes mark the worst violence since al-Assad was thrown out, with high casualties reported among religious minorities, including Alawites and Christians.\n\nIn late November,a rapid rebel offensiveled by the Sunni Islamist Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, which hasAl-Qaedaorigins, orchestrated the sudden downfall of decades-long Syrian President al-Assad. The former leader has since sought asylum in Moscow and HTS's al-Sharaa has taken over the top government post.\n\nOn Thursday, clashes between Syrian government forces and pro-Assad forces in the coastal area of Jableh, a predominantly Alawite region, escalated to death tolls of over 200 people. The SOHR says the initial attacks started after government forces were working to detain a wanted person and were ambushed by al-Assad loyalists. The AP reported that pro-Assad gunmen took control of Qardaha, Assad's hometown.\n\nClashes have broken out in Latakia and Baniyas, among other areas, with SOHR noting that over the weekend, electricity and drinking water were cut off in nearby areas.\n\nIn the following days, gunmen linked to the new government killed hundreds of people in the Alawite coastal areas in revenge attacks, according to SOHR, which documented at least 428 Alawite deaths. No official figures have been released.\n\nSOHR also reported hundreds killed in massacres and dozens in clashes. As of Saturday afternoon, it recorded 745 civilian deaths, along with 125 government security forces and 148 pro-Assad militants killed.\n\n\"This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,\" SOHR director Rami Abdurrahman said about the recent killings of Alawite civilians.\n\nLocal residents told Reuters that thousands of people, including Christians and Alawites, have fled the areas to nearby mountains for safety. The Christian population in Syria has drastically dwindled since the start of the civil war, with The Syrian Observer estimating only around 300,000 Christians remain in the country.\n\nAl-Assad ruled Syria for 24 years after succeeding his father, who led the country for three decades. He has been accused of numerous war crimesand crimes against humanity,including using chemical weapons like sarin gas on civilians, massacres, and starvation, among others. Thousands of Syrians weredetained without trial, many of them held in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, often for years.\n\nUnder al-Assad's rule, Alawites, a minority Shia Muslim sect in Syria,held top government and army posts. Now, with Alawites no longer in power, reports of revenge killings have emerged. Local reports have also highlighted targeted killings of Christians, who have a significant community in Latakia.\n\nThe patriarchs of Syria's three main Christian churches, the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic Churches, issued a joint statement on Saturday condemning the violence and \"massacres targeting innocent civilians.\" The religious leaders called for \"an immediate end to these horrific acts, which stand in stark opposition to all human and moral values.\"\n\nIn response to the clashes, Syrian state media has reported that security forces have deployed to Latakia and the region in an effort to regain control of the area.\n\nIn a Friday night address, Sharaa supported a crackdown in the area, and urged security forces to not exaggerate their responses, saying, \"When we give up on our morals, us and our enemy end up on the same side.\" He has asked for armed groups outside of the government forces to hand over their weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a Sunday statement:\"The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days. The United States stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families. Syria's interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres against Syria's minority communities accountable.\"\n\nGreco-Levantines World Wide, a nonprofit, wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post on Friday:\"Tony Petrus and his son Fadi Petrus, two Antiochian Greeks, were killed today in the pogrom launched by HTS against the mixed Christian and Alawite region.\"\n\nIn a Saturday post, it noted: \"The father of Fr. Gregorios Bishara, priest of the Church of Our Lady of the Annunciation, was martyred this morning at the hands of the pro-HTS armed factions that raided the city of Baniyas.\"\n\nCharles Lister, director of the Middle East Institute's Syria program, wrote in an X post on Saturday:\"Recent events show just how fragile #Syria's post-#Assad transitional period is -- and remains. Syrians in all corners are desperate to turn over a new leaf, but the costs of 13yrs of brutal conflict don't dissolve overnight. The pot boiled over.\"\n\nIn an earlier X post he wrote: \"interim gov't military ops on #Syria's Coast have been frozen & all roads shut in order to remove gunmen not under the command of the Defense & Interior ministries. 2 groups captured so far, while pro-#Assad attacks continue (3 in past hour).\"\n\nJoshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, wrote in an X post on Saturday: \"A total of 353 Alawite civilians lost their lives in #Syria yesterday, and dozens more were injured with varying degrees of severity.\"\n\nIn a follow up post, he added: \"The Jableh area had the highest number of massacres and casualties, accounting for about 44% of mass killings (10 massacres), with human losses amounting to around 38% (133 individuals). This was followed by Banias and Haffah, each with a mass killing rate of approximately 18% (4 mass killings each).\"\n\nStephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary General, said in a press statement on Friday:\"The Secretary-General strongly condemns all violence in Syria and calls on the parties to protect civilians and cease hostilities. The Secretary-General is alarmed by the risk of escalating tensions among communities in Syria at a time when reconciliation and peaceful political transition should be the priority.\"\n\nGregory Waters, a researcher at the Syrian Archive and analyst at Counter Extremist Project, wrote on X on Saturday:\"There is only one way forward for the coast and that it true inter-communal dialogues. Alawites must understand the Sunni experience while the new govt must start to empower genuine anti-regime Alawites (which absolutely exist, I've met them) to slowly erode the extremists.\"\n\nSyria's future remains volatile and uncertain as HTS works to establish its government and legitimacy, and sectarian clashes erupt along the coast.\n\nUpdated 3/9/25, 5:02 p.m. ET: This article has been updated to include additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

        "source_3": "Peace will not come from the obsession with creating a second state where the first is still denied.\n\nA supranational bureaucracy is trying to increase its own enormous budget while doing next to nothing to address fraudulent and erroneous EU spending.\n\nThe country’s notorious blasphemy laws are often used to target minority groups, with Christians disproportionately affected.\n\nThe al-Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) forces who took over Damascus in December killed hundreds of Syrian civilians over the last two days, targeting Alawites and Christians.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rightsreportedon March 8 that over 1,000 people, including 745 civilians, had been killed in two days of violence in the coastal region of western Syria, which is heavily populated by members of the Alawite minority. The victims include many children, women, and entire families. The exact death toll is estimated to be higher.\n\nChristians are also increasingly affected by the ongoing violence. In the city of Latakia, HTS terrorists reportedlymurdereda Christian, Tony Khoury, in his home on March 7. He was originally from the Maronite village of Dahr Safra, according to social media posts. According to local reports, on the same day, jihadist regime terrorists alsomurderedGreek Christians Tony Boutros and his son, Fadi Boutros.\n\nA Christian source in Syria toldeuropeanconservative.com:\n\n“We are afraid that after they finish with the Alawites, they will kill us en masse. After seeing the massacres yesterday, all people here are terrified.”\n\nSince Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew Syria’s Baathist regime and assumed control this past December, religious minorities have found themselves in increased peril. A journalist working in the country toldeuropeanconservative.com:\n\nOn February 26, a young Christian man and two Christians were stopped in Qasaa (Damascus) while returning from work. They were verbally abused and accused of lacking ‘honor’ simply for walking with a man in public. They were detained in the street for over two hours, threatened with arrest and imprisonment, and the young man repeatedly insulted. Eventually, two people intervened and told the abusers to let them go ‘this time.’ However, they were warned that if it happened again, both the man and the women would be detained and ‘properly disciplined.’\n\nThis is expected because HTS is a jihadist, terrorist organization. HTS was formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra (also known as the al-Nusra Front) which was al-Qaeda’s official wing in Syria. It also had links with ISIS (the Islamic State) and was designated by the United Nations as a terrorist organization.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham’s role in Assad’s eventual fall essentially began in July 2011, when Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—then the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq, previously known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)—sent Abu Mohammed al-Jolani to spearhead his group’s entry into Syria. This was the same Jolani who would later become the head of HTS, spearhead the offensive that toppled Assad, and adopt the name Ahmed al-Sharaa, thereby casting himself as Syria’s next leader.\n\nUnder al-Sharaa’s new regime, religious minorities (such as Christians, Druze, and Alawites) are subject to increased persecution. They are experiencing murders, abductions, arbitrary detentions, property grabs, and vandalism against their places of worship.\n\nSyria’s Christians, most of whom are of Greek descent and have lived there for thousands of years, are among the country’s most vulnerable minorities.\n\nThe journalist who spoke to this publication on the condition of anonymity was arbitrarily detained by HTS forces recently. He told us about his detention and the current situation in Syria regarding Christians:\n\nI was pressured over a personal matter and later detained by HTS forces. During this time, I faced intimidation and threats before eventually being released. HTS and its affiliates abuse their power against us, and the wealth of the Antiochian Greeks has become a target for extortion.\n\nSince HTS took control, there have been multiple incidents targeting Christians, particularly in areas like Qasaa and Bab Touma, he said.\n\nThese include the distribution of Islamist flyers calling on Christian women to wear the hijab, armed groups marching through Christian neighborhoods with Islamist flags, intimidating residents, and reports of land and property seizures targeting Christian families.\n\nThe Muslim population, emboldened by HTS’ rise to power, has engaged in increasing levels of intimidation and violence against Christians. In the ‘Christian Valley’, villages were urged by the regime to surrender their weapons. They did so, believing that only the state should have the right to bear arms. However, this decision left them defenseless, making them an easy target.\n\nNow, with HTS in control, many Muslim villagers see an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. Antiochian Greeks, who tend to be more educated and economically successful, are particularly vulnerable to extortion, land grabs, and outright violence.\n\nOn February 26th, near the Holy Cross Church in Damascus, HTS-linked security forcesharassedand attempted to detain a young Antiochian Greek man and two women, claiming to enforce “God’s law.”\n\nOn February 27th, locals woke up to find two small Christian shrines (Eikonostasia) in Damascusvandalized. Mobs had chanted “Allahu Akbar” while destroying them overnight before fleeing.\n\nOn March 3rd, HTS militants, masked with stockings,were filmedmoving weapons into private properties in the upscale Malki district of Damascus, home to Sunni Muslim and Christian residents, as part of their effort to seize the properties.\n\nMeanwhile, leaks from Syria’s Constitutional Declaration Committee have confirmed that the first article of the constitution will require a Muslim president.\n\n“This is not just legal exclusion; it is the formalization of deep-rooted cultural, political, and social marginalization of Syrian Christians,”notedthe X account Greco-Levantines Worldwide:\n\nThis is no less than racial segregation. It enshrines a system where Muslims are politically superior to Christians, despite the fact that Syrian Christians are among the most educated and peaceful communities in the country. No matter how qualified, they will always be second-class citizens.\n\nSyrian Christians built the country’s first newspapers, its banking system, its modern education system. But today, they are told they are not “Syrian enough” to lead it. The constitution will make sure of that. If Syrian Christians are good enough to pay taxes, serve in the army, and contribute to every part of the nation, why are they not good enough to be president?\n\nThe most urgent need for Christians in Syria is administrative decentralization: a system of strong municipalities with administrative autonomy, the journalist speaking toeuropeanconservative.comsaid.\n\nThis would allow local communities to manage their own affairs without interference from Islamist-controlled authorities, have local police forces to protect Christian neighborhoods and make independent decisions on issues like business regulations and religious policies.\n\nFor example, there is pressure from the new Islamist regime to shut down restaurants during Ramadan—a decision that should be left to municipalities in their own areas, not imposed on Christian neighborhoods.\n\nLocal governance with municipal police, judicial autonomy, and economic self-management would allow Christian communities to protect their interests without being physically isolated from other regions. This model ensures that Christians can maintain their presence across Syria, rather than being confined to one area. A strong municipal governance system is the most effective way to preserve our existence, protect our rights, and ensure a stable future in Syria."
