The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,\" Biden said.\n\nAnd his attack on an ultra-wealthy \"tech-industrial complex\" was a veiled reference at Silicon Valley executives such as Elon Musk, the world's richest man who is close to Trump and provided huge financial backing to his campaign.\n\nHis language echoed that of President Dwight Eisenhower who famously warned of  a \"military  industrial complex\" in his 1961 farewell address.\n\nBiden appeared to have Musk in mind when he warned of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a few ultra-wealthy people\".\n\nThe term oligarchy refers to a government that is run by a handful of people, often for their own gain.\n\nThe president went on to say there could be \"dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked\".\n\nOther tech bosses such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have also made efforts to improve relations with Trump ahead of his return to the White House.\n\nClosing his exit speech, which is a longstanding presidential tradition, Biden called on Americans to \"stand guard\" of their country: \"May you all be the keeper of the flame.\"\n\nHis farewell address came on the same dayhe announced a ceasefire agreementbetween Israel and Hamas, which he referenced in his opening remarks.\n\nBiden said the negotiations had been some of the toughest of his career, and took credit for helping get the deal over the line.\n\nThe deal will see a ceasefire take effect on 19 January, a day before Trump is due to take office. The incoming president has also taken credit for the agreement, saying it was only possible because he won the election in November.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in hisUS Election Unspunnewsletter.

Before I begin, let me speak to important news from earlier today. After eight months of nonstop negotiation, my administration — by my administration — a cease-fire and hostage deal has been reached by Israel and Hamas, the elements of which I laid out in great detail in May of this year,\" Biden said in his opening remarks.\n\n\"This plan was developed and negotiated by my team and will be largely implemented by the incoming administration. That's why I told my team to keep the incoming administration fully informed, because that's how it should be, working together as Americans.\"\n\nIsrael and Hamas reached a cease-fire agreement Wednesday that also ensured the release of hostages. A recent meeting between Trump's incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly played a pivotal role in the deal, sources told Fox News Digital.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN RELEASES FAREWELL LETTER, SAYS IT’S BEEN ‘PRIVILEGE OF MY LIFE TO SERVE THIS NATION'\n\nPresident Biden arrives to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland Aug. 15, 2023.(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe president in his farewell address also warned Americans there is a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people.\"\n\n\"I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. … That's a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people. The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN BALKS WHEN ASKED IF TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT FOR ISRAEL-HAMAS CEASE-FIRE DEAL: 'IS THAT A JOKE?'\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy.

The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France after our Civil War. Like the very idea of America, it was built not by one person, but by many people, from every background and from around the world. Like America, the Statue of Liberty is not standing still. Her foot literally steps forward atop a broken chain of human bondage. She's on the march, and she literally moves,\" he said.\n\nFOX NEWS GETS AN INSIDE LOOK AT IDF'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS\n\n\"A nation of pioneers and explorers, of dreamers and doers, of ancestors native to this land, of ancestors who came by force. A nation of immigrants came to build a better life, a nation holding a torch. The most powerful idea ever, in the history of the world, that all of us, all of us are created equal. That all of us deserve to be treated with dignity, justice and fairness. That democracy must defend and be defined and be imposed, moved in every way possible, our rights, our freedoms, our dreams.\"\n\nPresident Biden speaks from the Oval Office for his farewell speech to the American people(Fox News )\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE'S BEEN CARRYING OUT ‘MOST AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE AGENDA’ IN HISTORY AS HE DESIGNATES CALIFORNIA MONUMENTS\n\nBiden continued to call for a series of policies U.S. leaders should enact in the coming years, such as reforming the tax code to ensure billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" and to \"amend the Constitution to make clear that no president, no president, is immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office.\"\n\n\"We need to get dark money, that's that hidden funding behind too many campaign contributions. We need to get it out of our politics. We need to enact an 18-year … term for the strongest ethics reform … for Supreme Court. We need to ban members of Congress from power, from trading stock while they're in the Congress,\" he said.\n\nBiden has spent more than 50 years in public office, making his mark on the national map in 1972, President Richard Nixon's landslide re-election year, when he beat a Republican incumbent in a long-shot Senate race in Delaware at the age of 29.\n\nPresident Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House July 24, 2024, about his decision to drop his re-election bid.(Evan Vucci, Pool via AP)\n\nBiden served 36 years inthe U.S. Senate,one of the longest Senate careers in the chamber’s history, before joining former President Barack Obama’s ticket during the 2008 election and serving as vice president for eight years.\n\n\"After 50 years of public service, I gave you my word. I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands. A nation where the strength of our institutions, the character of our people, matter and must endure. Now it's your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep the faith. I love America. You love it too. God bless you all. May God protect our troops.
