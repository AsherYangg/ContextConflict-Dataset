His reported column chronicles the inside conversations and major trends shaping U.S. politics.\n\nThe remarkable, 11-year breadth of Joe Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter illustrated how worried the White House is about Trump officials seizing any potential openings for prosecution. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s senior aides are conducting a vigorous internal debate over whether to issue preemptive pardons to a range of current and former public officialswho could be targetedwith President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, according to senior Democrats familiar with the discussions.\n\nBiden’s aides are deeply concerned about a range of current and former officials who could find themselves facing inquiries and even indictments, a sense of alarm which has only accelerated since Trump last weekend announced theappointment of Kash Patelto lead the FBI. Patel has publicly vowed to pursue Trump’s critics.\n\nThe White House officials, however, are carefully weighing the extraordinary step of handing out blanket pardons to those who’ve committed no crimes, both because it could suggest impropriety, only fueling Trump’s criticisms, and because those offered preemptive pardons may reject them.\n\nThe deliberations touch on pardoning those currently in office, elected and appointed, as well as former officials who’ve angered Trump and his loyalists.\n\nThose who could face exposure include such members of Congress’ Jan. 6 Committee as Sen.-elect Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Trump haspreviously saidCheney “should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!” Also mentioned by Biden’s aides for a pardon is Anthony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who became a lightning rod for criticism from the right during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe West Wing deliberations have been organized by White House counsel Ed Siskel but include a range of other aides, including chief of staff Jeff Zients. The president himself, who was intensely focused on his son’s pardon, has not been brought into the broader pardon discussions yet, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nThe conversations were spurred by Trump’s repeated threats and quiet lobbying by congressional Democrats, though not by those seeking pardons themselves. “The beneficiaries know nothing,” one well-connected Democrat told me about those who could receive pardons.\n\nThe deliberations over preemptive pardons touch on former officials who’ve angered Donald Trump and his loyalists.|Matt Rourke/AP\n\nBiden’s ultimate decision, though, could prove just as consequential to some of the country’s most high-profile public officials as his choice to pardon his son.\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to comment on but did not deny the discussions.\n\nThat the conversations are taking place at all reflects the growing anxieties among high-level Democrats about just how far Trump’s reprisals could go once he reclaims power. The remarkable, 11-year breadth of Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter illustrated how worried the White House is about Trump officials seizing any potential openings for prosecution.\n\nAt issue, to repurpose a phrase, is whether to take Trump seriouslyandliterally when it comes to his prospective revenge tour against Democrats and others in the so-called Deep State who’ve raised his ire.\n\nEnd-of-administration pardons are always politically fraught. But President George H.W. Bush’s intervention to spare former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Bill Clinton’s pardon of financier and donor Marc Rich seem quaint compared with what Biden officials are grappling with as Trump returns to the presidency with lieutenants plotting tribunals against adversaries.\n\nAnd that was before the president pardoned his son, infuriating many of his own party already angry at Biden for insisting on running for reelection as he neared 82. Now, Biden’s aides also must consider whether they should offer the same legal inoculation to public officials who’ve attracted the ire of Trump or his supporters that the president granted his convicted son.\n\nThe White House is facing contradictory pressures from Capitol Hill. Some longtime Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), have talked favorably about the precedent of former President Gerald Ford’s preemptive pardon of Richard Nixon, issued before any charges were filed against the disgraced former president.\n\n“If it’s clear by January 19 that [revenge] is his intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that’s really what our country is going to need next year,”Markey said on WGBHlast week.\n\nRep. Brendan Boyle (D-Penn.), a close Biden ally who hosted the president in his district shortly before the election, issued a plea Wednesday for Biden to offer blanket pardons.\n\n“This is no hypothetical threat,” Boyle said in a statement, adding: “The time for cautious restraint is over. We must act with urgency to push back against these threats and prevent Trump from abusing his power.”\n\nOther lawmakers, I’m told, have been just as emphatic in private with Biden’s aides in calling for preemptive pardons.\n\nHowever, some congressional Democrats, including those who may be in Trump’s political crosshairs, are uneasy about the idea of being granted a pardon they’re not seeking.\n\n“I would urge the president not to do that,” Schiff said. “I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.”\n\nCheney and Fauci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome senior Democrats I spoke with, however, wonder how many of those facing retribution are adopting a version of the vote-no-hope-yes mantra that often surrounds difficult legislative votes. Which is to say: Some may publicly oppose preemptive pardons, for reasons of innocence or precedence, while privately hoping the president offers legal protection.\n\nWhat has some Biden aides particularly concerned is that even the threat of retaliation could prove costly to individuals because they’d be forced to hire high-priced lawyers to defend themselves in any potential investigation.\n\nEspecially for those officials without significant means, the specter of six-figure legal bills in the coming years is unnerving. Some Biden appointees, I’m told by people facing scrutiny, are already considering taking the best-paying jobs next year in part to ensure they have the resources to defend themselves against any investigations.\n\nAdding to Biden’s challenge in the final weeks of his presidency is the pressure he’s also feeling from Democrats who want him to offer the same generous clemency to those less privileged that he handed his son.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) invoked Hunter Biden’s pardon this week in calling on the president to, on a case-by-case basis, spare “the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.”\n\nCORRECTION:A previous version of this report misstated when Rep.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nOutgoing PresidentJoe Bidenis said to be considering preemptive pardons for a number of officials and allies who could be targeted by Donald Trump when he takes up the presidency next month.\n\nHistorically, pardons are issued to those who have already been accused of specific crimes, such as in the case of Biden recentlypardoning his son Hunter Biden.Preemptive pardons, though unusual, do have a historical precedent.\n\nPardons for crimes that people have not yet been accused of are currently being deliberated by White House lawyers, and Biden has discussed the issue with senior aides,ABCNews reported.\n\nThere are fears thatDonald Trumpmay go after his enemies when he takes up the presidency for a second time in January. The president-elect has talked about \"locking up\" senior political figures such asLiz Cheney, while Kash Patel, Trump's pick for director ofFBI, also reportedly has alist of peoplehe wants to \"come after.\"\n\nIf preemptive pardons are issued, it's likely they will be given to a range of people. These may includeAnthony Fauci, who led the COVID-19 response and is unpopular with conservatives; Cheney, who campaigned against Trump in the election; and California Democratic Senator-electAdam Schiff, who led the first Trump impeachment trial. The consensus on such pardons amongDemocratsis divided.\n\nIn astatementon Wednesday, Democratic representative Brendan Boyle voiced his support for Biden to issue a \"blanket pardon\" for those at risk of being vindictively targeted by Trump—something he described as \"no hypothetical threat.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Schiff—potentially in line for a preemptive pardon himself—voiced his resistance against Biden issuing such pardons.\n\nLast month Schiff told NPR: \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"\n\nNewsweekhas emailed the White House press office for comment.\n\nA preemptive pardon is a pardon that is granted before any formal legal proceedings against the individual have begun.\n\nThis compares to the more traditional form of pardons, which are issued during legal proceedings, or after a conviction.\n\nSearches on whether preemptive pardons are legal have risen by 150 percent over the course of the past day.\n\nPreemptive pardons sound unusual, but they are legal.\n\nTheSupreme Courtcase of Ex parte Garland in 1866 sets down that \"the power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted the power of pardoning as \"plenary,\" meaning that legislation can't restrict it.\n\nPresidential pardons also have historical precedent.\n\nThe most famous case of a preemptive pardon was in 1974 when President GeraldFordgranted his predecessor Richard Nixon a \"full, free and absolute pardon\" over the Watergate scandal.\n\nFord reasoned that any trial of Nixon would \"cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States.\"\n\nIn 1992, outgoing PresidentGeorge H.W. Bushpardoned former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger before he was brought to trial over the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nAbraham Lincoln issued preemptive pardons in the Civil War andJimmy Carteralso preemptively pardoned Vietnam draft-dodgers in 1977.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nLottie McGrath is a Newsweek news reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is reporting on U.S. politics, current affairs and entertainment.

Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., who hosted Biden in battleground Pennsylvania before the election, called on the president to issue blanket pardons when Patel's nomination was announced — though he did not specify the intended recipients.\"By choosing Kash Patel as his FBI Director, Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law. Patel has openly published an ‘enemies list’ in his book, naming individuals he and Trump plan to investigate and prosecute — targeting those who stood up to Trump’s lies, abuses of power, and baseless attempts to overturn the 2020 election. This is no hypothetical threat,\" Boyle said in a statement. \"The people they’re targeting include law enforcement officers, military personnel, and others who have spent their lives protecting this country. These patriots shouldn’t have to live in fear of political retribution for doing what’s right.

The report — which found thatCOVID-19 most likely emerged from a laboratoryin Wuhan, China — supported how Fauci \"played a critical role in disparaging the lab-leak theory\" among top scientific circles early in 2020 and later to the public. His congressional testimony to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., the report states, misled the public regarding National Institute of Health funding of gain-of-function research at coronavirus labs.\n\nIt goes on to cite how Fauci testified that the six-foot social distancing rule imposed on Americans \"sort of just appeared\" and did not support quality scientific standards, when he was grilled on what studies he and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed before announcing the policy. He also gave similarly vague testimony when asked what science supported K-12 public school mask mandates.\n\nDanielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.
