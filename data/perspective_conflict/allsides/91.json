Zelenskyy said this conversation was “long and substantive,” while Trumpsaidit “couldn’t have been nicer.”\n\n“The Trump administration needs to abandon the pretense that it is a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war. The United States is not an outsider whose only interest lies in seeing the carnage end. Like its European allies and partners, it has a huge stake in the outcome…Washington should adopt the position of the leader of the West, engaged in close consultation with its partners and allies. That will not preclude constructive dialogue with Russia, as relations during the Cold War amply demonstrate, nor does it mean the United States cannot play a critical role in bridging the chasm between Russia’s and Ukraine’s security demands..”\n\n—CFR Distinguished Fellow Thomas Graham in aUkraine Policy Brie\n\nU.S.-Iran diplomacy.Washington and Tehranwill hold talksnext week, Trump said yesterday. He cautioned that the talks might not result in a new nuclear agreement but that “we want no nuclear.” Iran did not immediately confirm plans for talks, though U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoffsaidthe two countries had been in touch in recent days. In a video released today, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali KhameneicongratulatedIranians for what he called a victory over Israel and the United States in the recent conflict,saying“nothing significant” had come of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nPullout from vaccine initiative.U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said Washingtonwill suspendcontributions to Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, claiming it was not following scientific practices. Gavirejectedthose accusations, saying its “utmost concern is the safety and health of children.” The United States currently funds around 13 percent of the agency, which helps buy vaccines for children in low-income countries.\n\nNew UK fighter jets.The United Kingdom (UK)plans to buyU.S.-made F-35A warplanes that can carry tactical nuclear weapons, giving its air force the capability to deploy such weapons for the first time since the end of the Cold War. The UK’s already existing nuclear arsenal is designed to be launched from submarines. The announcementcould allow forU.S. nuclear weapons to be stored on UK soil for the first time since 2008.\n\nIran’s internal crackdown.Iran’s governmentexecutedthree people on Wednesday accused of spying for Israel, and Iranian authorities have arrested more than seven hundred people in recent days, reports from semi-official news agencies said. The crackdown comes after Israeli media aired footage that appeared to show Israeli agents firing weapons from inside Iran during the recent war. Human rights groups have warned that Iranian authorities could sweep up innocent people; Iran’s embassy in London did not immediately comment.\n\nFlight to space station.A four-person flightarrivedat the International Space Station (ISS) today thatincludedthe first Hungarian, Indian, and Polish astronauts to visit the research center. The three governmentssponsoredthe flight, which was run by private U.S. space company Axiom. A retired NASA astronaut was its commander.\n\nDeadly protests in Kenya.At least sixteen peoplediedand hundreds more were injured after protesters clashed with police during demonstrations Wednesday. The protests were intended to commemorate the one-year anniversary of tax-hike protests that also turned deadly. The casualties were counted by Kenya’s national commission on human rights, Amnesty International said. Kenya’s governmentorderedbroadcasters not to cover the protests live.\n\nIndonesia’s green investments.The Indonesia Investment Authority, one of the country’s sovereign wealth funds, aims togrowits renewable energy investments from 12 percent to as much as 20 percent of its portfolio by the end of this year, its CEO toldNikkeiat an energy summit. The top investment officer of Danatara, another sovereign wealth fund launched earlier this year, said it hopes to invest in upgrades to the country’s electric grid.\n\nU.S. targets Mexican firms.The U.S. Treasury Departmentaccusedthree well-known Mexican financial services firms of facilitating payments for fentanyl trafficking, and announced theywould be bannedfrom certain interactions with the U.S. financial system. Mexico’s Treasury Ministrysaidit had asked Washington for details of the accusations but that it did not immediately receive evidence. The sanctions are the Treasury Department’s first actions under new authorities from a law against fentanyl smuggling enacted last year.\n\nIsrael Risks Overplaying Its Hand in Gaza and the Middle East\n\nbyRoger W.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nUkrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskysaid Wednesday on X, formerlyTwitter, that he and PresidentDonald Trumpdiscussed potential defense cooperation during a meeting at theNATOSummit, including the joint production of drones with American companies and the purchase of U.S. air defense systems.\n\n\"We can strengthen each other,\" Zelensky wrote, emphasizing the strategic value of closer military ties. He also noted that he briefed Trump on the current realities of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I presented him with what is really happening on the ground,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"Putin is definitely not winning.\"\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Zelensky marked their first in-person conversation since April, when they met briefly at St. Peter's Basilica duringPope Francis' funeral. The two also had a high-profile confrontation earlier this year at the White House.\n\nNATO members have agreed to significantly increase their defense spending, setting a new target of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually by 2035. The funds will be directed toward core defense needs as well as broader defense- and security-related expenditures—more than doubling the previous benchmark of 2 percent of GDP.\n\nAt a press conference concluding the summit, President Trump praised the decision, linking it to broader geopolitical stability.\n\nTrump also reiterated his belief that Russian PresidentVladimir Putinis seeking a way out of the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"He'd like to get out of this thing. It's a mess for him,\" Trump said. \"He called the other day, and he said, 'Can I help you with Iran?' I said, 'No, you can help me with Russia.'\"\n\nIn a social media post, Zelenskyy described their discussions in The Hague as productive and meaningful, and he expressed gratitude for continued U.S. support.\n\nTrump said, following his meeting with Zelensky,\"Europe stepping up to take more responsibility for security will help prevent future disasters like the horrible situation with Russia and Ukraine. And hopefully we're going to get that solved.\"\n\nAsked by a Ukrainian reporter, who said that her husband was a Ukrainian soldier,Trump acknowledged that sending more Patriots would help the Ukrainian cause,\n\n\"They do want to have the antimissile missiles, OK, as they call them, the Patriots. And we're going to see if we can make some available. We need them, too. We're supplying them to Israel, and they're very effective, 100% effective. Hard to believe how effective. They do want that more than any other thing.\"\n\nZelensky wrote in full on X,\"I had a good meeting with@POTUSin The Hague. I congratulated President Trump on the successful operation in the Middle East. It is important that the U.S. actions have weakened not only their nuclear program but also their drone production capabilities. We will continue to keep an eye on the situation. We discussed the protection of our people with the President — first and foremost, the purchase of American air defense systems to shield our cities, our people, churches, and infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to buy this equipment and support American weapons manufacturers. Europe can help. We also discussed the potential for co-production of drones. We can strengthen each other.\n\nHe continued, \"I also informed the President about how the technical team's meetings in Istanbul went, as well as the exchanges of prisoners and the fallen. Russia handed over the bodies of its own troops. Forensic examinations are currently being carried out in Kyiv to identify their relatives. We talked about the situation on the battlefield. Putin is definitely not winning. I presented the President with the facts about what is really happening on the ground. Thank you for the meeting and your support. I'm also grateful for the truly kind words about our people. We will keep working.\"\n\nUkraine, though not a NATO member, has remained a focal point at recent alliance summits. However, as the latest annual meeting of NATO leaders began in the Netherlands, Zelensky was notably absent—his country's bid for membership currently blocked by the Trump administration.\n\nMeanwhile, the war with Russia continues to devastate Ukraine. Entire towns have been reduced to rubble, thousands of civilians have been killed, and just last week, Russia carried out one of the largest drone assaults since the invasion began.\n\nThis article includes reporting by The Associated Press.\n\nUpdates: 6/25/25, 2:05 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.\n\nUpdates: 6/25/25, 8:05 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor atNewsweekbased in North Carolina.

Zelenskyy questioned the value of diplomacy, noting that Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas broken other agreements in the past.\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" Zelenskyy said. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nVance said, \"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance said. \"Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for bringing it, to bring it into this country.\"\n\nTRUMP SAYS ZELENSKYY CAN ‘COME BACK WHEN HE IS READY FOR PEACE’ AFTER FIERY WHITE HOUSE EXCHANGE\n\nVice President JD Vance, right, speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, as President Donald Trump listens in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington.(Mystyslav Chernov/The Associated Press)\n\nFollowing the tense exchange, Trump announced a halt to peace negotiations and said that Zelenskyy could return to the White House when he was \"ready\" for peace. Just after leaving the White House, Zelenskyy issued a post on X thanking the U.S., Trump, Congress and the American people for backing Ukraine.\n\nAlthough Zelenskyy and Trump continued to exchange harsh barbs at one another following the Oval Office visit, they've subsequently spoken over the phone and met in person at St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City during Pope Francis’ April funeral.\n\nWHERE ZELENSKYY IS HEADED FOLLOWING TENSE WHITE HOUSE EXCHANGE WITH TRUMP, VANCE\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, and President Donald Trump, left, talk as they attend the funeral of Pope Francis in the Vatican, Apr. 26, 2025.(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said Wednesday that his administration has not been able to finalize a peace deal with Ukraine and Russia, claiming that both leaders have been more challenging to work with than expected.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin has been more difficult,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday. \"Frankly, I had some problems with Zelenskyy. You may have read about him, and it's been more difficult than other wars.\"\n\nStill, Trump said that his meeting with Zelenskyy went smoothly, and that he would be speaking to Putin as well.\n\n\"He's very nice, actually,\" Trump said of Zelenskyy. \"A little rough at times. He couldn't have been nicer.
