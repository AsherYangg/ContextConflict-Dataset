The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S.President Donald Trump’s suggestionthat many Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries rejected the idea.\n\nA man places a photo of Arbel Yehoud, next to a banner in Hebrew demanding the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza Strip, at the entrance of a tent set up in Jerusalem, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Mahmoud illean)\n\nWhether hostages are still alive inside Gaza has been a heartbreaking question for waiting families who have pushed Israel’s government to reach a deal to free them, fearing that time was running out.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, Israel believed that at least 35 of the about 90 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack and still in Gaza were dead.\n\nGovernment spokesman David Mencer told journalists that a list received overnight from Hamas on the status of the 33 hostages being freed under the ceasefire’s first phase showed eight were dead.\n\nThe families have been informed, he said, adding that the information matched what Israeli intelligence had believed.\n\nThe ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250.\n\nIsrael responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nIn all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, and they facenew health risksas they return.\n\nRelatives hug each other, as displaced Palestinians arrive in the northern Gaza Strip, following Israel’s decision to allow thousands of them to go back for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)\n\nIsmail Abu Mattar, a father of four who waited for days near the crossing point for northern Gaza, described scenes of jubilation, with people singing, praying and crying.\n\n“It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Mattar, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.”\n\nIn the war’s opening days, Israel ordered the evacuation of the north and sealed it off after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled south while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting andthe worst destruction.\n\nThe opening to the north was delayed for two days as Israel said Hamas had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Local medical officials said Israeli forces opened fire at the waiting crowd and killed several Palestinians over the weekend. Israel’s military said it fired warning shots at approaching groups it deemed a threat.\n\nMediatorsresolved the dispute overnight. Hamas called the return “a victory for our people.”\n\nLater Monday in central Gaza, Awda hospital said it received the body of a child killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp when returnees were hit, and three others were wounded. It said three more were wounded in a separate attack near the camp.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians arrive in the northern Gaza Strip, following Israel’s decision to allow thousands of them to go back for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)\n\nIsrael’s military said one of its aircraft fired “to distance a number of suspicious vehicles” moving north in unauthorized areas. And it said it fired shots in northern Gaza to “remove” someone it deemed a threat who didn’t move away.\n\nPalestinians were crossing on foot without inspection through part ofthe Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza’s main north-south highway, where traffic was backed up for around 3 kilometers (2 miles).\n\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, vehicles are to be inspected for weapons before entering the north.\n\nAn Egyptian official said Egyptian contractors, along with a U.S. firm, run checkpoints that inspect vehicles heading via Salahuddin road. The contractors are part of an Egyptian-Qatari committee implementing the ceasefire, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The contractors are cleared by Israel.\n\nIsrael had delayed the crossing’s opening, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four female soldiers who werefreed on Saturday.\n\nQatar, a key mediator, announced early Monday that Yehoud and two other hostages would be released by Friday. Israel said the release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages should be released on Saturday as previously planned.\n\nThere were mixed emotions among Israelis watching the scene in Gaza from the nearby city of Sderot. Some expressed mistrust toward the Palestinians. Others were empathetic.\n\n“Let them come back home safely and conduct a normal life,” said one, Rachel Osher. “We also want it. We want the same on both sides of the border.”\n\nShurafa and Hana reported from Wadi Gaza, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

Israel accused Hamas of breaching the ceasefire deal under which Israeli civilians were to be freed first in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nSince the ceasefire deal came into force, seven hostages and just under 300 prisoners have been released.\n\nFootage showed thousands of displaced Palestinians walking northwards having gathered at a military barrier blocking their progress two days earlier.\n\nThe ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release deal came into force on 19 January. Two exchanges have been completed.\n\nIn the third, Hamas will release Ms Yehud and two other hostages on Thursday, followed by three more on Saturday, Netanyahu and Qatar, which has mediated the talks, said.\n\nIsrael will begin to allow Palestinians to move north on Monday, as well as freeing more Palestinian prisoners later in the week.\n\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinians had been scheduled to be allowed to travel north of the Netzarim Corridor, a seven kilometre (4.3 miles) strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the territory, on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, images showed massive crowds waiting to pass.\n\n\"We're sleeping in the streets,\" Nireem Musabeh told the BBC at the checkpoint on Sunday. \"We can't go home and every time we try to go home they shoot at us.\"\n\nThe 42-year-old had travelled from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, but was displaced from her home in Shejaiya, in the south.\n\nDiab Shehbari said he had been at the checkpoint since 20:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday.\n\n\"All night the kids were screaming because of the cold - we lit a fire and covered them,\" he said.\n\nIsrael said it would allow residents to return to the northern Gaza Strip from 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Monday, and by vehicle two hours later, after the row over Ms Yehud was resolved.\n\nQatari and Egyptian mediators who have facilitated talks between Israel and Hamas were involved in the efforts to end the dispute.

It appeared that had been given to the Egyptians as early as Saturday evening, the BBC understands.\n\nEarlier on Sunday,US President Donald Trump said he wanted Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza, which he described as a \"demolition site\".\n\nBoth Hamas and the Palestinian Authority condemned the idea, while Jordan and Egypt have also rejected the proposal.\n\nThe January ceasefire deal halted the war which began when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages.\n\nMore than 47,200 Palestinians, the majority civilians, have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".\n\nProtesters call for the release of hostages still being held in Gaza as they voice support for Israel.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN, and Jonathan Miller, Deputy Permanent Representative for Israel to the UN, address a UN Security Council meeting.\n\nBBC correspondent Emir Nader speaks to demonstrators against the Israel's plans for Gaza, including a former soldier who says he no longer supports the government.",
