        "source_1": "The Russian has broken a record some believed would never be passed. But, like the man whose mark he bettered, he has received scrutiny away from the rink\n\n“He’s definitely a very, very, very good player,” the Washington Capitals’ director of amateur scouting, Ross Mahoney, told reporters on the night of the NHL entry draft in June 2004. He was talking about Alex Ovechkin, who the team picked first overall that night. “How good will he be?” Mahoney asked. “Time will tell.” Now, nearly 21 years later, time has had its say. On Sunday afternoon in a game against the New York Islanders,Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, passing Wayne Gretzky’s all-time NHL scoring record, a tally that had stood since 29 March 1999 and that few believed would ever be broken.\n\nHad things been slightly different in 2004, we might have been having this conversation a year ago. TheNHLseason after Ovechkin’s draft – the 2004-05 campaign – never happened, replaced instead by a long dispute between the league and the players’ union. Ovechkin bided his time in Russia, where he played 37 games with Dynamo Moscow. Finally, in autumn of 2005, he stepped on to NHL ice for Washington and, as Mahoney – and everyone else – expected by that time, he proved immediately to be a very good player. Ovechkin scored two goals in his first game, the first of an eventual 52 on the season (alongside 54 assists).\n\nThat rookie year tally included what is still regarded as one of the most impressive, and improbable, goals of all time. During a game against the Phoenix Coyotes, Ovechkin somehow scored while sliding along the ice on his back, facing away from the Coyotes net. “It was unbelievable,” Auston Matthews, who was eight at the time and at the game that night,later recalled. “Nobody really cheered, they really couldn’t get their heads wrapped around what just happened. It was pretty crazy.” Also not cheering was the coach standing behind the Coyotes’ bench that night: Wayne Gretzky.\n\nWhen Ovechkin helped bring the Stanley Cup to Washington in 2018, the first in the team’s history, he fulfilled the expectations that had followed him for his 12 NHL seasons to that point. And it certainly seemed like he knew it. Nobody celebrated with the Cupquite like Ovi did– nor, frankly, has anyone done it with the same reckless abandon since. The Cup also meant that Ovechkin solidified himself among the greats – as a man capable of scoring, but also winning. On that count, until Ovi began to close in on Gretzky’s goal record, he was most closely compared to Sidney Crosby, who entered the NHL a season after Ovechkin. The two have never been exactly stylistically identical, yet their points totals have tracked alongeerily similar trajectoriesfor the entirety of their careers. But until the Caps’ Cup, Crosby – with three championships – was usually regarded as the more accomplished player overall. While Ovechkin’s goal record may not fully balance things out, it seems fitting that, with it, the two players will likely be regarded in the long run as equals – the best examples of what the NHL has to offer.\n\nOn the ice, anyway. Elsewhere, Ovechkin’s astonishing playing career may always be accompanied by an asterisk: a note about his unsavory, full-throated support for Vladimir Putin. In 2017, Ovechkinlaunched Putin Team, a social movement that, as he wrote in an Instagram post at the time, “unites people who are proud of their country and want to make Russia stronger.” It went on to say that Putin Team was for people who valued Putin’s “trust in and respect for his people, his fairness [and] righteousness, and the fact that he really cares.” Ovechkin recruited other Russian athletes to the cause, including Crosby’s longtime Pittsburgh Penguins teammate, Evgeny Malkin. In a separate post at the time, Ovechkin wrote that “I never hid my relationship with [Putin], always openly supported him.” Indeed, Ovechkin stood alongside Putin in his Instagram profile photo.\n\nIn 2022, after Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, Ovechkin was less open about the closeness of that relationship, but fell well short of criticizing the Russian leader. Unlike fellow Russian NHLer Artemi Panarin –who said, among other things, that Putin “no longer understands what’s right and what’s wrong” – Ovechkin only said that he didn’t want to see anyone get hurt or killed in the conflict and that he hoped “it was going to be over and we are going to be living in a good world.” As for whether he still supported Putin,Ovechkin said, “Well, he’s my president, but [like] I said, I’m not in politics, I’m an athlete.”\n\nObviously, that’s never really been true for Ovechkin, but it also feels increasingly that it can’t be true for anyone. When Ovi started out, perhaps athletes could more easily separate their sport persona with the world beyond the game. But over the course of the two decades of Ovechkin’s career, the political and cultural environment has changed significantly, as has the broad perspective of past actions. Now, nobody is free from scrutiny, and whatever dotted line that some athletes once tried to draw between politics from sports in the past, is now gone. Even Gretzky isn’t immune. Where for decades Gretzky was considered untouchable, his own recent close association with a controversial politician, Donald Trump,has undermined his greatnessin the eyes of many of his fellow Canadians. The Great One is now, as they say, The Great Once.\n\nOvechkin is still great, as far as the hockey goes. That’s undeniable. But just as on his draft day only time could tell how great a player he’d be, history will now dictate how great he is ultimately considered to have been. When he talked to reporters after the game in Phoenix in 2006 where Ovechkin scored his greatest goal, Gretzkysaidit was “pretty nice.” “He’s a phenomenal player ... He deserves all the accolades he’s getting.” That’s still true. But by the same token, he will deserve everything else, too.",
        "source_2": "Ovechkin surpassing Gretzky’s record would ordinarily be a feat worth cheering about. But the Russian hockey star’s politics and ties with Putin are hard to ignore\n\nIt was a cold January night at Moscow’s famed Luzhniki Palace of Sports, just 21 years ago but in a completely different world.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was in the White House. He had just looked into the eyes of Russia’s new President, Vladimir Putin. Afterward, Mr. Bush infamously said he’d seen into Mr. Putin’s soul and decided this was someone he could trust.\n\nOn the ice that night, an 18-year-old kid wearing the blue-and-white jersey of Moscow Dynamo grabbed a loose puck in the neutral zone and accelerated across the blue line as the opposing defencemen scrambled backward. After a series of fakes, he fired a snapshot from the high slot past the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv goaltender, breaking what had been a scoreless tie, then dove and jubilantly slid on his knees back toward his teammates. It proved to be the game-winning goal.\n\nReporter Mark MacKinnon interviews Alexander Ovechkin, then 18 years old and playing for Moscow Dynamo, at the Luzhniki Palace of Sports in Moscow in January, 2004.Guy Nicholson/Supplied\n\nAfter the game, the kid wearing No. 32 for Moscow Dynamo – who would later become famous wearing No. 8 for theWashington Capitals– chatted politely with a Canadian reporter about the buzz that he was likely to be chosen first overall in that summer’s NHL draft.\n\nWearing a black tuque and a black Nike jacket, his cheeks red with acne, Alexander Ovechkin was such a fixture at Luzhniki – he’d come up through Dynamo’s youth hockey program – that even security staff at the rink called out to him by his nickname, “Sasha.”\n\nHe has since gone on toNHLsuperstardom, scoring his 895th career goal on Sunday to setthe newall-time record,surpassing Wayne Gretzky.\n\nOvechkin and Wayne Gretzky were in Vancouver together for the NHL draft in 2006, when the latter was Phoenix's head coach. Two decades later, Ovechkin would be within reach of the Great One’s all-time record.Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images\n\nIf the world had remained the way it was in 2004, the game when the Great Eight passed the Great One would have been a moment to celebrate the unifying power of sport. The shy kid from Moscow, who was born in the Soviet Union but grew up in an independent, democratizing Russia, eclipsing the shy kid from Brantford, Ont. The memories of all those heated Canada-vs-USSR games – Bobby Clarke’s 1972 slash to Valeri Kharlamov’s ankle, the 1987 line brawl at the world junior championship – would have faded a little more as we cheered the passing of the torch.\n\nButhistory has gone otherwise,tainting first Mr. Ovechkin and then Mr. Gretzky as it moved.\n\nMr. Putin, who was briefly seen as someone who could reform and strengthen Russia’s young democracy, instead crushed his domestic opposition, preparing the ground for a series of wars, including the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq set the United States on its own increasingly angry path that has culminated with the re-election of Donald Trump, a President who speaks admiringly of Mr. Putin and muses about annexing Canada the way Russia has illegally seized parts ofUkraine.\n\nThe Ovechkin I met in January, 2004, was obliging and humble, not unlike how Mr. Gretzky came across when he first aw-shucksed himself into the hearts of Canadians a few decades earlier.\n\n“I don’t want to think about it right now – I just want to help Dynamo make it to the playoffs,” Mr. Ovechkin said via a translator when I asked him if he cared which team ended up drafting him. “When it’s draft time, I’ll think about it.”\n\nHe was shy and soft-spoken, the opposite of his already flamboyant on-ice personality – and nothing like the fun-loving face of the NHL he would become.\n\nMr. Ovechkin seemed to know little about the outside world, and nothing about any of Pittsburgh, Chicago, Columbus or Washington, the four teams that were front-runners to pick No. 1 that summer. (The Capitals had the third-best odds of picking first in the 2004 draft, but leapfrogged Pittsburgh and Chicago in the lottery.)\n\nHe told me that he had no favourite NHL team. Mr. Ovechkin’s hockey heroes, he made clear, were the stars of the Russian and Soviet hockey systems, not the NHL pantheon headed by Mr. Gretzky. He named Alexander Maltsev, a slick Moscow Dynamo forward who won two Olympic gold medals for the USSR, as his icon.\n\nThat patriotism, perhaps, provided a hint of what was to come.\n\nOvechkin counts Alexander Maltsev, left, among his heroes. He played for the Soviets in the 1972 Summit Series, where Dennis Hull, middle, Phil Esposito, right, were on Team Canada.Grigory Dukor/Reuters\n\nOvechkin’s Instagram profile features a photo of him with Putin.\n\nMr. Ovechkin’s legacy, in the eyes of many, will be tainted by the fact that he appears to have a close personal relationship with Mr. Putin, who is an avid hockey player and fan. Infamously, Mr. Ovechkin’s profile picture on Instagram is a photo of him standing in the Grand Kremlin Palace beside the Russian leader.\n\nThat choice of avatar has caused Mr. Ovechkin endless grief since the start of the invasion of Ukraine, but it still remains the first image you see when you visit his page.\n\nIt’s not a one-off, either. Mr. Ovechkin, who captained Russia’s 2014 world championship team, caused ripples by immediately presenting Mr. Putin with the trophy – just two months after the Russian leader had seized and illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Three years later, Mr. Putin called Mr. Ovechkin to congratulate him on his wedding.\n\nWhile Mr. Ovechkin’s defenders say he has no choice but to be publicly deferential to the dictator for his family’s sake, that rings hollow to the tens of thousands of Ukrainians, Georgians, Chechens, Syrians – and Russians – who have died fighting in Mr. Putin’s wars.\n\nOn the day after the invasion of Ukraine began – as missiles were raining down on Kyiv and other cities, and Russian troops and tanks were pouring over the border – Mr. Ovechkin simultaneously claimed he was not involved in politics, while also making his politics perfectly clear.\n\n“Well, he’s my President,” he said, when asked whether he still supported Mr. Putin. “Like, I am Russian, right?”\n\nMr. Gretzky’s own awkward politics, meanwhile, have managed to mar Canada’sfive-decade love affairwith him.\n\nThe legend that every Canadian hockey fan knows – the kid who started out firing a tennis ball at his grandmother’s legs while she played goaltender in her chair, who stayed out late every night on his backyard rink and became the greatest scorer the NHL had ever seen – now has a tawdry epilogue. Mr. Gretzky went from captaining the national team at the 1987 Canada Cup to becoming the focus of nationwide ire after the now-dual national wore a blue business suit, rather than Team Canada gear, while serving as honorary captain for the final game of this year’s patriotically charged 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nMr. Gretzky’s friendship with Mr. Trump – who has floated the idea of Mr. Gretzky serving as “governor” of Canada after it becomes the 51st state – has cost him his saintly statuseven in Edmonton, where he set many of his records. Last month, the city’s statue of Mr. Gretzky hoisting the Stanley Cup was smeared with feces.\n\nMr. Gretzky was in New York to congratulate Mr. Ovechkin after his record-breaking goal, just as Gordie Howe and Phil Esposito used to follow him around when he was breaking the records they had set. Unlike those iconic moments, in simpler times, there were likely some watching who jeeredMr. Ovechkin, Mr. Gretzky or both.\n\nIf a Canadian team had been involved in Sunday’s games, national anthems might also have been booed, reflecting the dark geopolitical era in which the kid from Moscow surpassedthe kid from Brantford as the top goal-scorer in NHL history.\n\nIt could have been, should have been, a great moment. If only all that other stuff hadn’t happened, too.\n\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed inFollowing.",
        "source_3": "Alex Ovechkin completed his chase of Wayne Gretzky on Sunday at UBS Arena, scoring his 895th career goal to stand atop hockey’s all-time list, blasting the puck in from the top of his office, the left circle, for a power-play goal at 7:26 of the second period after Casey Cizikas went off for tripping.\n\nRight after the puck hit nylon, Ovechkin went into a swan dive toward center ice, the Capitals and Islanders alike spilled off the benches and a crowd largely made up of Caps fans exploded in adulation.\n\nALEX OVECHKIN IS THE GREATEST GOALSCORER IN NHL HISTORY! 🚨🚨🚨#Gr8nesspic.twitter.com/NKef3VvNaJ\n\nThe game between the Capitals and Islanders was stopped for a ceremony, with the Capitals getting commemorative hats and Ovechkin saluting the crowd. Up in a suite, Gretzky stood and applauded before making his way to the ice along with Ovechkin’s family, Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\nA video salute to Ovechkin played on the Islanders’ video board, including messages from his wife, two kids and mother.\n\n“895’s pretty special,” Gretzky said during the ceremony. “… They say records are made to be broken, but I’m not sure who’s gonna score more goals than that.”\n\n“Wayne you’ll always be the Great One and you had a record that nobody thought would be broken,” commissioner Gary Bettman said during the ceremony. “But Alex, you did it. You were amazing.”\n\nMuch of Ovechkin’s speech was drowned out by the crowd, and the video that played afterward included congratulations from luminaries including Derek Jeter, Michael Jordan, Roger Federer, Jayden Daniels, Doc Emrick, Buster Posey, Martin Brodeur, Ryan Zimmermann, Katie Ledecky, LeBron James, Michael Phelps, Steve Carrell and Snoop Dogg, among others.\n\nIt was Ovechkin’s 45th career goal against the Islanders in 72 games, making them luckier than the Winnipeg Jets and Carolina Hurricanes, against whom No. 8 has scored 57 and 52 times, respectively, but unluckier than most. Among those includes goal No. 691, to pass Mario Lemiux for 10th on the all-time list; goal No. 718, to pass Phil Esposito for 6th; and goal No. 767, to pass Jaromir Jagr for third.\n\nAfter No. 767, on March 15, 2022, then-Islanders coach and former Capitals coach Barry Trotz would say of Ovechkin that, “The one thing I’ve learned about Ovi over my time is that when you doubt Ovi or you say he can’t do it, he digs in.”\n\nBefore Sunday’s game, Patrick Roy, the current Islanders coach, said his team would “raise our hat” to Ovechkin should he break the record on them. Indeed they did\n\nIlya Sorokin, one of few goalies lucky enough to have faced Ovechkin without allowing a goal, ended up on the wrong side of the highlight. He and Ovechkin are friends, dating back to time spent together on the Russian national team.\n\n“To Ilya Sorokin, sorry,” Ovechkin said during his speech.\n\nAfter Ovechkin scored twice in Washingtonto tie the record on Friday, ticket pricesshot through the roofat UBS, with the get-in price spanning from $700 into the thousands. The crowd, clad mostly in red despite the trek from D.C. to Long Island, hummed each time Ovechkin touched the puck, hoping their investment would pay off with history.\n\nWith the league throwing its resources into celebrating Ovechkin, it seems clear that the superstar’s popularity has not been dented byhis support of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Ovechkin endorsed and campaigned for Putin in a sham 2018 election and his Instagram profile picture is of himself with the dictator, and in 2014 he posted on social media in support of Russia’s invasion of Crimea.\n\nAsked in 2022 whether he supported the country’s invasion of mainland Ukraine, Ovechkin demurred.\n\n“I’m Russian, right? It’s not something I can control,” he said. “It’s not in my hands. I hope it’s going to end soon and there’s going to be peace in both countries. I don’t control this one.”\n\nNevertheless, this was a Capitals home game on Long Island and a loud celebration of Ovechkin."
