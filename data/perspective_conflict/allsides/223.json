        "source_1": "A senior Hamas delegation departed Cairo late Saturday following talks with Egyptian officials aimed at brokering aceasefire agreementand the entry of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to a statement by Hamas.\n\nThe delegation, led by Chairman of the Hamas Leadership Council Muhammad Darwish, included other key leaders, among them Khaled Meshaal, Khalil al-Hayya, Zaher Jabarin, and Eng. Nizar Awadallah.\n\n“The delegation reviewed the movement’s vision for reaching a comprehensive deal that achieves a ceasefire, prisoner exchange, relief, and reconstruction. It was agreed to exert further efforts and continue communication to ensure the success of these efforts,” Hamas said in the written statement on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the statement, the talks also addressed the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and “the need for urgent action to deliver aid and supplies to the Strip’s citizens.”\n\nRelated articleIsrael acknowledges killing aid worker in strike after initially accusing UN of ‘baseless slander’\n\nIsrael renewed its bombing campaign and launched a complete siege on Gaza in March, saying the attacks would put pressure on Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal and release the remaining 59 Israeli hostages. More than 2,151 Palestinians have since been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.\n\nThe health ministry meanwhile raised its overall toll from the conflict in Gaza to 52,243, saying it had confirmed the deaths of nearly 700 people reported missing. The death toll includes those killed in the past six weeks of renewed conflict after the collapse of a ceasefire on March 18, as well as more than 16,000 children and 12,000 women who have been killed in the war. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants.\n\nIn January, the Israel Defense Forces said it had killed 20,000 Hamas operatives since October 7.\n\nA senior UN official in Gaza City, northern Gaza,warned ofthe “deliberate dismantling of Palestinian life,” a day after the agency ran outof foodin the strip. Human rights officials have repeatedly accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war – charges Israeliofficials denied.\n\n“People are not surviving in Gaza – those who aren’t shot or bombed are slowly dying. They are being suffocated,” said Jonathan Whittall, the head of office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\n“What we see around us is endless suffering under a total and complete blockade,” he added. “People in Gaza tell me that they feel like it’s the deliberate dismantling of Palestinian life – in plain sight.”\n\nThe head of Mossad, David Barnea, was in Doha, Qatar, earlier this week, for ceasefire talks – but there was no indication of a significant breakthrough.\n\nBut with the renewed effort, mediators in Qatar expressed their belief in “some progress” in both parties’ readiness to achieve a ceasefire deal last week after Barnea’s visit.\n\n“Hamas is ready to release all the hostages in exchange for the release of prisoners, according to terms that Israel may reject,” Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani told reporters on Sunday. “Israel seeks the release of all hostages without offering any horizon for ending the war on Gaza.”\n\nThere are currently 59 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, of which up to 24 are believed alive. One of the bodies still held in Gaza is a deceased soldier from 2014.\n\nAn Egyptian official had told CNN that the Israel has been invited to meet with negotiators in Cairo on Monday. It’s also unclear if Israel has accepted the invitation.\n\nCNN reached out to Hamas for comment on the details of Hamas’ proposal for a ceasefire.\n\nAn Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel has not received a new offer from the mediators for now.\n\n“Israel only reacts to offers passed on by the mediators,” the source said.\n\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump said he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “We’ve got to be good to Gaza.” Taking questions on the way to Italy, Trump said, “there’s a very big need for medicine, food and medicine. We’re taking care of it.”\n\nThe president, whose administration has unapologetically backed Israel, offered no details about what steps the US was taking to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel put forward a ceasefire proposal that called for a disarmament of Gaza without guaranteeing an end to the war, which violates two of Hamas’ red lines.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Friday that he encouraged Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuto allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza as his nation's war withHamas, a Palestinian militant group, remains ongoing.\n\nNewsweekreached out to Netanyahu's office for comment via email on Friday.\n\nOn March 2, Israelstopped all aid and other suppliesheading into Gaza, with Netanyahu warning Hamas at the time that \"additional consequences\" could come to fruition.\n\nTwo days prior to the halt of food, medicine and other supplies, thefirst stage of a six-week ceasefiredeal helped brokered by Trump administration officials expired. Under that arrangement, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages held in Gaza while Israel returned close to 2,000 Palestinians from Israeli custody.\n\nHamas' unprecedented October 7, 2023, attack on Israel has sparked more than 18 months of war in Gaza. More than 1,200 people died and 251 more were taken as hostages into the enclave, before Israel launched an intensive aerial and ground campaign against Hamas in the densely-populated strip.\n\nThe war has devastated the territory, often displacing Gaza's nearly 2 million inhabitants several times and killing more than 51,200 people, according to Hamas-run authorities. This number does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday aboard Air Force One that he had spoken with Netanyahu and Gaza \"came up\" including humanitarian aid.\n\n\"I said, 'We've got to be good to Gaza...Those people are suffering,'\" the president said, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump also replied in the affirmative when asked if that included opening access points in the region to provide said aid.\n\n\"We're going to take care of that,\" Trump said. \"There's a very big need for medicine, food and medicine, and we're taking care of it.\"\n\nNetanyahu \"felt well about it,\" the president added.\n\nIn the past, Israel has blamed aid agencies in Gaza for what it described as ineffectively distributing resources, and said militants have stolen supplies from aid trucks.\n\nShaiel Ben-ephraim, an Israeli journalist and self-described Zionist who supports a two-state solution, toldNewsweekon Friday that he believes Netanyahu and Israel will heed Trump's advice—that is assuming that Trump means what he's saying.\n\n\"There is always a chance with [Trump] that there will be no follow-through,\" Ben-ephraim said. \"It could just be an offhand comment. But if Trump puts actual pressure on Netanyahu with even a hint of possible consequences, then Bibi will cave.\"\n\nHe continued: \"He is beholden to the president for domestic legitimacy, since his base loves Trump, and cannot fight the president the way he would a Democrat, since he will get no support inCongress. In addition, starving the population in Gaza has consequences with the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the ICJ [International Court of Justice], as well as relations with theEU[European Union]. So, my guess is, despite significant opposition in his government, Netanyahu will let in enough aid to alleviate the immediate crisis.\"\n\nAlso on Friday, theUnited NationsWorld Food Programme (WFP) announced it had depleted all of its food stocks for families in Gaza, Reuters reported.\n\nThe last remaining stocks included hot meals delivered to kitchens in the Gaza Strip, the Programme said, with anticipation that the kitchens would fully run out of food \"in the coming days.\"\n\nThe consistent sustenance provided to people in Gaza is acknowledged to have reached just half the region's population and with only 25 percent of daily food needs but offered \"a critical lifeline\" for survival.\n\nWFP added that all 25 supported bakeries to distribute affordable bread in Gaza closed on March 31 as wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. The same week, WFP food parcels were exhausted. They are also \"deeply concerned\" about the severe lack of safe water and fuel for cooking, officials toldNewsweek.\n\n\"More than 116,000 metric tons of food assistance—enough to feed one million people for up to four months—is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be brought into Gaza by WFP and food security partners as soon as borders reopen,\" a WFP spokesperson toldNewsweek. \"The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unraveled. Without urgent action to open borders for aid and trade to enter, WFP's critical assistance may be forced to end.\"\n\nFollowing the March 2 halt by Israel, multiple Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan condemned Israel and Netanyahu.\n\nOfficials from Qatar, whoseforeign ministry helped brokerthe now expired ceasefire deal, at the time called Israel's action \"a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement, international humanitarian law, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and all religious principle.\"\n\nIn response to the WFP saying it depleted all of its food stocks, journalist Mehdi Hasan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday:\"Horrific. And all with Trump's blessing and approval. I'm old enough to remember when some people on this hellsite were telling me how Trump would be less worse on Gaza than Biden/Harris.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on April 22:\"I've just spoken to Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi @Netanyahu, relative to numerous subjects including Trade, Iran, etc. The call went very well—We are on the same side of every issue.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post on March 2:\"Massive amounts of goods have already been delivered to the Gaza Strip, and there is no shortage of essential products in the Strip. The quantities of goods are so large that they are expected to last for at least several more months...The goods transferred to Gaza have become the number one source of income for Hamas. The goods have been exploited by Hamas for the reconstruction of its terror infrastructure – Hamas is now running a billion-dollar aid industry that is being used for terrorist purposes.\"\n\nBasem Naim, a spokesperson for Hamas and senior political figure in the militant group,previously toldNewsweekthat \"cutting the aid and closing the borders is a war crime in itself,\" saying that Netanyahu \"has to be punished for that.\"\n\nIsrael has provided no indication that they will heed Trump's recommendation and allow more aid to enter Gaza.\n\nUpdate 4/28/25, 9:58 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from the World Food Programme.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek investigative reporter based in Michigan.
