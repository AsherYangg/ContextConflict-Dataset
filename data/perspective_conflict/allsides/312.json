(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\nJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The Trump administration lifted itssuspension of military aidandintelligence sharing for Ukraine, and Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in thewar with Russia, pending Moscow’s agreement, American and Ukrainian officials said Tuesday following talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe administration’s decision marked a sharp shift from only a week ago, when it imposed the measures in an apparent effort to push Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyto enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump argued about the conflict ina tense White House meeting.\n\nSoldiers of Ukraine’s 100th mechanised brigade hold posters saying thanks the US for support during flashmob at the US made APC Bradley on the front line near Toretsk, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Monday, March 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Roman Chop)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation to the talks in Jeddah, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions.\n\n“We’re going to tell them this is what’s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no,” Rubio told reporters after the talks. “If they say no, then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.”\n\n▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration\n\nUS National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, left, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hold a meeting with Ukrainian officials, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Saul Loeb/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nTrump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, added: “The Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump’s vision for peace.”\n\nTuesday’s discussions, which lasted for nearly eight hours, appeared to put to rest — for the moment at least — the animosity between Trump and Zelenskyy that erupted during the Oval Office meeting last month.\n\nWaltz said the negotiators “got into substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end,” including long-termsecurity guarantees. And, he said, Trump agreed to immediately lift the pause in the supply of billions of dollars of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing.\n\nInvestigators look at the damage of an apartment building where the downed Ukrainian drone fell in Sapronovo village outside Moscow, Russia, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (AP Photo)\n\nTrump said he hoped that an agreement could be solidified “over the next few days.”\n\n“I’ve been saying that Russia’s been easier to deal with so far than Ukraine, which is not supposed to be the way it is,” Trump said later Tuesday. “But it is, and we hope to get Russia. But we have a full ceasefire from Ukraine. That’s good.”\n\nThe Kremlin had no immediate comment on the U.S. and Ukrainian statements. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said only that negotiations with U.S. officials could take place this week.\n\nTrump‘s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel later this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change.\n\nOfficials met in Saudi Arabia only hours after Russia shot down over 300 Ukrainian drones in Ukraine’s biggest attack since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion. Neither U.S. nor Ukrainian officials offered any comment on the barrage.\n\nRussia also launched 126 drones and a ballistic missile at Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said, as part of Moscow’s relentlesspounding of civilian areas.\n\nIn an address posted shortly after Tuesday’s talks ended, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s commitment to a lasting peace, emphasizing that the country has sought an end to the war since its outset.\n\nCORRECTS CITY - In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, meets with Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the Royal Palace in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Monday, March 10, 2025. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\n“Our position is absolutely clear: Ukraine has strived for peace from the very first second of this war, and we want to do everything possible to achieve it as soon as possible — securely and in a way that ensures war does not return,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nUkrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak, who led the Ukrainian delegation, described the negotiations as positive. He said the two countries “share the same vision, and that we are moving in the same direction toward the just peace long awaited by all Ukrainians.”\n\nIn Kyiv, Lena Herasymenko, a psychologist, accepts that compromises will be necessary to end the war, but she said they must be “reasonable.”\n\n“We had massive losses during this war, and we don’t know yet how much more we’ll have,” she told The Associated Press. “We are suffering every day. Our kids are suffering, and we don’t know how the future generation will be affected.”\n\nOleksandr, a Ukrainian soldier who could give only his first name because of security restrictions, warned that Ukraine cannot let down its guard.\n\n“If there is a ceasefire, it would only give Russia time to increase its firepower, manpower, missiles and other arms. Then they would attack Ukraine again,” he said.\n\nIn Moscow, hawkish politicians and military bloggers spoke strongly against a prospective ceasefire, arguing that it would play into Kyiv’s hands and damage Moscow’s interests at a time when the Russian military has the advantage.\n\n“A ceasefire isn’t what we need,” wrote hardline ideologue Alexander Dugin.\n\nViktor Sobolev, a retired general who is a member of the Russian parliament’s lower house, warned that a 30-day truce would allow Ukraine to beef up arms supplies and regroup its troops before resuming hostilities.\n\nSergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political commentator, suggested that Moscow could demand a halt on Western arms supplies to Ukraine as part of a ceasefire. “An embargo on arms supplies to Ukraine could be a condition for a truce,” he wrote.\n\nRussia has not publicly offered any concessions. Putin has repeatedly declared that Moscow wants a comprehensive settlement, not a temporary truce.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks with the governor of Perm territory Dmitry Makhonin during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Monday, March 10, 2025. (Mikhail Metzel, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nRussia has said it’s ready to cease hostilities on the condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine’s territory.\n\nRussian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year, though at a high cost in infantry and armor, and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in theeastern Donetsk region.\n\nUkraine has invested heavily in developing its arms industry, especiallyhigh-tech drones that have reached deep into Russia.\n\nAssociated Press writers Baraa Anwer in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Hanna Arhirova and Dmytro Zhyhinas in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine athttps://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.
