        "source_1": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he was “very angry” and “pissed off” when Russian President Vladimir Putincriticized the credibilityof Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s leadership, adding that the comments were “not going in the right location.”\n\nAgence France-Pressereported that Putin on Friday called for a transitional government to be put in place in Ukraine, which could effectively push out Zelenskyy.\n\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.\n\n“That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States,” Trump said. “There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.”\n\nTrump had criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was“sick”of his handlingof the war andfalsely calling hima dictator.\n\nPresident Joe Bidenbanned Russian oil importsshortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, the amount of Russian oil imported to the United States has plummeted, to only 10,000 barrels of Russian crude oil and petroleum products in 2023, according to theU.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrump similarly announced \"secondary tariffs\" on Venezuela,saying on Truth Socialthat the tariffs would be placed on countries that bought oil and gas from Venezuela.\n\nA few of the top importers of Russian oil products include China, Turkey, Brazil and India, according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. If Trump uses the same definition of secondary tariffs he used with Venezuela, they could be among the countries seeing impacts of secondary tariffs.\n\nTrump had made ending the war in Ukraine a top foreign policy promise on the campaign trail, leading to meetings among U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials in the first few months of his second term. Last week, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a partial and limited ceasefire that would allow safe navigation in the Black Sea and halt attacks on each other’s energy facilities.\n\n“There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,” Trump said, saying the tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal. Trump said Putin knows he is angry but said he has “a very good relationship with him” and “the anger dissipates quickly ... if he does the right thing.”\n\nThe two men plan to speak again this week, Trump said.\n\nHe made the comments after aseparate phone interviewwith NBC News on Saturday evening, when he threatened “bombing” and “secondary tariffs” on Iran if it did not make a deal with the United States to ensure it did not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n“If they don’t make a deal,” Trump said about Iran, “there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”\n\nU.S. and Iranian officials are “talking,” Trump said.\n\nHowever, Iranian PresidentMasoud Pezeshkianrejected direct negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program in a statement Sunday, Iran’s first response to a letter Trump sent to its supreme leader.\n\nKristen Welker is the moderator of \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.",
        "source_2": "March 30 (UPI) --PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Sunday that he was \"angry\" at Russian President Vladimir Putin for comments he made criticizing the legitimacy of Ukrainian leaderVolodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed inUkraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault -- which it might not be -- but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Trumpsaid in an interviewwith NBC News on Sunday.\n\nThe president added that entities that buy oil from Russia would not be able to do business in the United States and said there would be a 25% tariff on all oil if Russia does not reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine within a month.\n\n\"There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,\" Trump said.\n\nStill, Trump said the leaders had \"a very good relationship\" and that his anger would dissipate quickly \"if he does the right thing.\" He noted plans to speak with Putin again this week.\n\nPutin has repeatedly and often called Zelensky the \"illegitimate\" leader of Ukraine and demanded a change in leadership there since at least 2021. These remarks include a Russianstate media reportthat Putin said Zelensky could not sign any peace documents because of his \"illegitimacy\" and because Ukraine does not have sovereignty.\n\nBut Putin laid off such comments after his Feb. 12 call with Trump, the U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of Warsaid in its analysisFriday. Putingave an interviewto Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin on Feb. 24 that appears to be the first time he acknowledged Zelensky's proper leadership of the country.\n\nPutin alleged at the time that Zelensky was seeking to avoid negotiations to end the war because it would mean the end to martial law in Ukraine, which would lead to the resumption of elections that were postponed last year because of the war.\n\nSpeaking Thursday during a visit to a nuclear-powered submarine, Putin reiterated such claims and suggested that the United Nations could establish an interim government, according to atranscript provided by the Kremlin.\n\n\"The current civil authorities in Ukraine have no legitimacy in accordance with the country's constitution,\" Putin said.\n\n\"Ukraine has held no presidential election, while according to the constitution, all key officials are to be appointed by the president, including regional government bodies, governors and so on. So, if the president is illegitimate, so are all the others.\"\n\nPutin said Zelensky's successor could then declare a resumption in the war by claiming that peace documents were not legitimate. He pointed to several instances where the United Nations formed peacekeeping operations that exerted external rule and temporary administration over countries.\n\n\"In principle, it would indeed be possible to discuss, under U.N. auspices with the United States and even European countries -- and certainly with our partners and allies -- the possibility of establishing a temporary administration in Ukraine,\" Putin said.\n\n\"To what end? To conduct democratic elections, to bring to power a competent government that enjoys public trust, and only then to begin negotiations on a peace treaty and sign legitimate agreements that would be recognized worldwide as consistent and reliable.\"\n\nKremlin SpokesmanDmitry Peskovappeared to slightly temperPutin's comments by stating they were just one idea \"worth considering.\"\n\n\"Russia is dragging out the war, and we are providing our partners with full information on the strikes the Russian army is carrying out and the actions it is preparing for,\" Zelenskysaid in a statementSunday. \"We expect a response from the United States, Europe and all our allies to this terror against our people.\"\n\nThe Economistreportedthat Ukrainian elections could be held as early as June. That timetable would require a ceasefire to be reached by May 8 in accordance with Ukrainian law.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministryin a war updateSunday claimed major advances on multiple fronts in Ukraine.\n\nThe ministry said it captured Zaporozhe in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and struck over a dozen brigades near key cities like Kupyansk, Volchansk, and Chasov Yar. Moscow reported killing over 1,300 Ukrainian troops in a single day and destroying Western-supplied vehicles, artillery, and radar systems.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministryin turn saidit had killed an estimated 1,510 Russian troops while destroying 14 tanks and 111 tactical drones, among other Russian weapons.",
        "source_3": "Moscow claimed things were still amicable with Washington as it ordered the conscription on 160,000 new Russian troops — despite PresidentTrump saying he was “pissed off”at Vladimir Putin for delaying peace negotiations.\n\nTrump shook up the Kremlin on Sunday when he voiced his first real rebuke of Putin after the Russian strongman called forUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyto be ousted by his own generals — and doubled down on his threat to whack Russian oil with tariffs if an end to the war isn’t reached within a month.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tried to downplay Trump’s outrage and insisted that Moscow and Washington are still actively working to rebuild relations after they were cut off underthe Biden administrationover the Ukraine invasion.\n\n“We are also working on implementing some ideas related to the Ukrainian settlement,” Peskov told reporters. “The work is underway, so far there are no specifics that we would have to inform you about.”\n\nBut the Kremlin’s actions do not align with its words, with Putin on Monday ordering the conscription of 160,000 new troops between now and July 15, the Russian news agency Interfax reported Monday.\n\nPeskov also rebuked Trump’s claim that the US and Russian presidents would be talking again this week, with the spokesman saying no such appointment was on the books, but it could be quickly organized “if necessary.”\n\nThe attempt at damage control comes after Trump doubled down on his threat and deadline for Putin, telling reporters on Air Force One Sunday night that he’s frustrated with Moscow’s repeated attacks on Zelensky.\n\n“I was disappointed in a certain way. Some of the things that he [Putin] said over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,” Trump said.\n\n“Because when he considers Zelensky not credible — he’s supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don’t like him. So I wasn’t happy with that,” Trump added.\n\nTrump’s rebuke comes despite his own condemnation of Zelensky earlier this year, where he had echoed Moscow’s description of the Ukraine presidentas a “dictator.”\n\nWhile Trump reiterated that he still had good relations with Putin, he said he was confident the Russian president would comply with his demands or face the consequences.\n\nThe president warned that Russia would be hit with a 25% to 50% tariff on all oil, as well as a slew of secondary tariffs, if a cease-fire deal isn’t reached within a month.\n\n“I think he’s going to be good and I certainly wouldn’t want to put secondary tariffs on Russia, but, if they were put on, it would not be very good for them,” Trump warned.\n\nThe Trump administration continues to push for an end to the war to fulfill the president’s campaign promise, with the US securing two cease-fire agreements last week to halt attacks against each nation’s energy grid and inthe busy Black Sea trade route.\n\nMoscow, however, broke both agreements within hours and then called for a slew of new conditions to fulfill the deal, including for Europe to lift several economic sanctions against Russian businesses.\n\nBoth top Republicans and Baltic state leaders, who fear they would be next on Russia’s invasion path if Ukraine falls, have warned the president against taking Putin at his word."
