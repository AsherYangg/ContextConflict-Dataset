        "source_1": "Tennessee state law enforcement on Thursday released a video showing a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an incident Trump administration officials have used to justify the removal of the Maryland man who the government has admitted was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March.\n\nUS officials have argued the traffic stop in November 2022, during which Abrego Garcia was not detained, supports their claims that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 and involved in human trafficking. The stop resulted in no charges, and there was no mention of human trafficking in the parts of the redacted report that have been made available.\n\nYet the 2022 traffic stop now could play into the ongoing political debate and legal standoff over Abrego Garcia, who is still in El Salvador while a federal judge demandsanswers and more evidencefrom the Trump administration.\n\nSo far in the ongoing court proceeding over his custody, his attorneyshave said thatthe US in his 2019 immigration proceedings offered little reason to believe Abrego Garcia was tied to a gang, other than the fact he wore a Chicago Bulls hat and that a confidential informant provided a tip to authorities.\n\nIn the years since, his attorneys had struggled to get more information from law enforcement on accusations of Abrego Garcia’s possible ties to MS-13, and the federal government hadn’t given him more proceedings before putting him on the plane to El Salvador.\n\n“There is no known link or association between him and the MS-13 gang,” his lawyers told the federal judge last month.\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN regarding the bodycam footage, Abrego Garcia’s attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said, his client “has been denied the most basic protections of due process—no phone call to his lawyer, no call to his wife or child, and no opportunity to be heard.”\n\nSandoval-Moshenberg added that “I see no evidence of a crime in this footage. But the point is not the traffic stop — it’s that Mr. Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court. Bring him back to the United States, return him before the same immigration judge who heard his case in 2019, and let him speak for himself.”\n\nIn bodycam footage released by Tennessee Highway Patrol, Abrego Garcia can be seen saying, “Hello, sir” to a state highway trooper after being stopped for speeding on Interstate 40 near Cookeville, between Nashville and Knoxville.\n\n“Good, and you?” Abrego Garcia responds. “Alright,” the trooper says.\n\n“You got a bunch of people here, don’t you?” the trooper then says, pointing to several people in the car with Abrego Garcia.\n\nAbrego Garcia says there are multiple people in the car and tells the trooper he and the others are workers returning from a construction project in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe trooper tells Abrego Garcia he stopped him because he was driving 75 mph in a 65 mph zone. Abrego Garcia apologizes and said he thought the speed limit was higher.\n\nWhen the trooper asked for his documents, Abrego Garcia explains that his driver’s license was expired and that he is waiting for immigration documents to renew it. He tells the officer the vehicle, which had a Texas license plate, belonged to his boss.\n\nThe trooper then searches the car with a police canine. They do not appear to find anything suspicious, according to the video.\n\nOther officers appear at the scene during the traffic stop. One trooper raised suspicions that Abrego Garcia was transporting undocumented immigrants to Maryland for money.\n\n“You know what you got here, right? He’s hauling these people for money,” the trooper said. He pointed out that the SUV did not contain any luggage.\n\nThe troopers later appear to count the number of people in the car at 11, including Abrego Garcia.\n\nA redacted police report released to CNN by the highway patrol on Thursday did not address the troopers’ suspicions of human trafficking. It showed that Abrego Garcia’s Maryland license expired roughly two months before he was stopped in Tennessee.\n\nCNN reached out to the Tennessee Highway Patrol for more details about the traffic stop.\n\nEarlier, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway Patrol told CNN that Abrego Garcia was flagged to federal law enforcement, “who made the decision not to detain him.”\n\nAccording to a Department of Homeland Securitystatementreleased last month about the incident, federal officials released Abrego Garcia with a warning for driving with an expired license.\n\nThe DHS statement characterized the 2022 traffic stop as a “suspected human trafficking incident,” citing it as evidence against what Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called “the media’s sympathetic narrative” about Abrego Garcia.\n\n“The facts speak for themselves, and they reek of human trafficking,” she said in the statement.\n\nThe Trump administration has used the incident as part of its efforts to portray the Maryland man as an MS-13 gang member with a violent history, despite growing public outcry against his deportation and criticism about the lack of due process afforded to him.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s family and his lawyers deny the claim he is a gang member.\n\nIn recent court filings, his attorneyshave askedthe Trump administration to provide them “the complete factual basis” for their belief Abrego Garcia belongs to MS-13. But Justice Department lawyers have argued that they believed they didn’t need to provide that information.\n\nJudge Paula Xinis in the federal court in Marylandis still overseeinghow the Justice Department provides evidence to Abrego Garcia’s attorneys.\n\nBut publicly the Department of Homeland Security when talking to the media about this case hascited a Virginia Police reportfrom a traffic stop, where Abrego Garcia was identified as a member of MS-13 by a reliable confidential informant.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has disputed the DHS’ version of the traffic stop, saying her husband “worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites.”\n\n“He was not charged with any crime or cited for any wrongdoing,” Vasquez Sura said, adding, “Unfortunately, Kilmar is currently imprisoned without contact with the outside world, which means he cannot respond to the claims or defend himself.”\n\nUS officials have so far refused to return Abrego Garcia to the US, despite admitting in court in March that he was deported because ofan administrative errorthat ignored a judge’s 2019 ruling that he couldn’t be sent back to El Salvador, where his life could be in danger.\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 withheld his removal, citing concerns for his safety. That meant he could not be deported to El Salvador but could be deported to another country. A gang in his native country the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family’s pupusa business.”\n\nThe Trump administration has argued they lack power to force El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia to the US because he is in the custody of a foreign government, despite a Supreme Court’s ruling requiring the government to “facilitate” the return of the man, the government told a federal judge was mistakenly deported.\n\nHowever, in an interview with ABC that aired earlier this week, President Donald Trump said he “could” make the call to bring Abrego Garcia back to the US but won’t do so.\n\n“You could get him back. There’s a phone on this desk,” ABC News’ Terry Moran, said to Trump duringan exclusive interviewthat aired Tuesday.\n\nPointing to the phone, Moran said: “You could pick it up and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the President of El Salvador and say, ‘Send him back.’”\n\n“And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” the president added. “But he is not.”\n\n“This is a MS-13 gang member,” Trump again said in the ABC interview, citing Abrego Garcia’s tattooed hands which contain skulls covering their eyes, ears and mouth, which a police document described as “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.”\n\nGang experts who spoke with CNN, however, say the tattoos alone are not proof of membership in MS-13.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez, Michael Williams, Devan Cole and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.",
        "source_2": "The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the US in March - has prompted a legal showdown over the administration's immigration policy.\n\nJudges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help \"facilitate\" his return to his home in Maryland.\n\nBut the White House has accused Mr Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, saying he \"will never live\" in the US again.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged he has the ability to bring Mr Abrego Garcia back to the US, but that he will not do so.\n\nMr Abrego Garcia denies he is a member of the gang and he has not been convicted of any crime.\n\nBBC Verify has examined court documents and public records to determine what's known – and what is still unknown – about Mr Abrego Garcia and his alleged ties to MS-13.\n\nMr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally in 2012,according to court documents.\n\nIn March 2019 he was detained along with three other people in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the car park of a Home Depot.\n\nOfficers at the Prince George's County Police Department said the men were \"loitering\" and subsequently identified Mr Abrego Garcia and two of the others as members of MS-13.\n\nIn a document titled the \"Gang Field Interview Sheet\", the local police detailed their observations.\n\nThey said Mr Abrego Garcia was wearing a \"Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations\".\n\nOfficers claimed the clothing was \"indicative of the Hispanic gang culture\" and that \"wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents thay [sic] are a member in good standing with the MS-13\".\n\nSteven Dudley, a journalist and author who has spent years studying the MS-13 gang, said that it is true that \"at some point, the Chicago Bulls logo with the horns became a stand-in of sorts for the MS-13's devil horns symbol\".\n\nBut wearing the logo of the hugely popular basketball team, he added, is of course not exclusive to the gang.\n\n\"Any assertions about gang affiliation would need to be corroborated with testimony, criminal history, and other corroborating evidence,\" Mr Dudley said.\n\nAccording to the field interview sheet and other court documents, officers said they were also advised by a \"proven and reliable source\" that Mr Abrego Garcia was an active member of MS-13's \"westerns clique\", with the rank of \"chequeo\".\n\nHowever, Mr Dudley says that a \"chequeo\" is not a rank, but is instead used to refer to recruits who are yet to be initiated.\n\nThe White House has also alleged that tattoos on Mr Abrego Garcia's hands - a marijuana leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull - are gang symbols, an allegation that Trump repeated in an interview with ABC News journalist Terry Moran.\n\nThe administration previously released a picture, digitally labelled with the characters M, S, 1 and 3, in an attempt to explain the meaning of the tattoos.\n\nThe symbols are open to interpretation. Experts who previously spoke to BBC Verify have cast doubt on the claim that these tattoos mean what Trump and his team allege.\n\nHowever, Trump's nominee to run the Drug Enforcement Agency, Terrance Cole, told his Senate confirmation hearing that the tattoos are consistent with MS-13 associations.\n\nLawyers for Mr Abrego Garciaargued in court filingsthat the \"westerns clique\" is based in New York, where they say their client has never lived. And according to government documents, he has dismissed the information given to police against him as \"hearsay\".\n\nAccording to his lawyers, Mr Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. He lived in the US for 14 years, had three children and worked in construction, according to court records.\n\nBut the judge who presided over his 2019 casesaid that based on the confidential information, there was sufficient evidence to support Mr Abrego Garcia's gang membership. That finding was laterupheld by another judge.\n\nAs a result Mr Abrego Garcia was refused bail and remained in custody. During this time he applied for asylum to prevent his deportation to El Salvador.\n\nIn October 2019 he was granted a \"withholding of removal\" order,court documents show- a status different from asylum, but one which prevented the US government from sending him back to El Salvador on the grounds that he could face harm.\n\nMr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say he was granted the statusbased on his \"well-founded\" fear of persecutionby Barrio-18, the main rival gang of MS-13.\n\nHe said that before entering the US, his family and their business had been threatened and extorted by Barrio-18.\n\nSince 2019, when he was released with the protective order, Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say he has had yearly check-ins with immigration officials, which he has attended \"without fail and without incident\".\n\nTwo other allegations have surfaced since Mr Albrego Garcia was deported.\n\nIn 2021, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order petition against him, alleging that he had physically attacked her on multiple occasions,according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMs Vasquez Sura said in a statement on 16 April that she had decided not to follow through with the court process at the time and that she and her husband \"were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling\".\n\nShe described her husband as \"a loving partner and father\" and has repeatedly denied he is an MS-13 gang member.\n\nOn 15 April, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Mr Abrego Garcia of involvement in human trafficking.\n\nShe appeared to be referencing a report in The Tennessee Star, a conservative news website, which claimed Mr Abrego Garcia was detained by a Tennessee highway patrol officer on suspicion of human trafficking in December 2022.\n\nA report by the Department of Homeland Security said he was stopped for speeding and not staying in his lane.\n\nThere were eight other people in the car without luggage, the report said, which led the officer to suspect it could be a case of human trafficking.\n\nHowever, there was no criminal case lodged against Mr Abrego Garcia.\n\n\"Kilmar worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, so it's entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle,\" Ms Vasquez Sura said about the incident.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",

The troopers called ICE, which didn't come to pick up Abrego-Garcia.\n\nThe source added that when state troopers entered Abrego-Garcia's name into the National Crime Information Center, a warning appeared that showed he was suspected of being a gang member or terrorist.\n\nIn the video, a trooper said Abrego-Garcia was in possession of $1,400 in cash, saying it was probably his payment.

Abrego-Garcia first said he was headed back to his residence in Maryland, then said he was going to a different town for work. He said the group of individuals were initially driving from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital. \"The hole that Democrats and the Fake News media dug themselves into by demanding the return of a wife-beating MS-13 terrorist illegal alien just keeps getting deeper.\"\n\nCourt records filed in Prince George’s County, Maryland, reveal that Abrego-Garcia has a history of being a \"violent\" wife beater.\n\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia traffic stop(Tennessee Highway Patrol)\n\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia traffic stop(Tennessee Highway Patrol)\n\nIn a 2021 court filing, Jennifer Vasquez, Abrego-Garcia's wife, wrote: \"At this point, I am afraid to be close to him.
