        "source_1": "After months of fraught negotiations with the United States, Japan clinched a deal just days before punitive tariffs were scheduled to take effect.\n\nRiver Akira Davis, the Japan business and economics correspondent, reported from Tokyo.\n\nWhen Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s chief trade negotiator, departed Tokyo on Monday morning for the latest round of tariff discussions in Washington, he left behind a nation inpolitical turmoiland bracing for a new jolt of economic pain.\n\nMr. Akazawa’s party, the Liberal Democrats, had suffered a crushing defeat in elections the previous day, rendering it aminority governing partyin both houses of Parliament.\n\nJapan was also barreling toward an Aug. 1 deadline to reach a trade agreement with the United States. The Trump administration had vowed to impose a punishing25 percent blanket tariffon Japanese goods shipped to the United States — the largest buyer of its exports.\n\nThe successful negotiation of a deal was widely seen as critical to the political survival of Shigeru Ishiba, Japan’s prime minister and a longtime ally of Mr. Akazawa. But after more than three months andseven roundsof tariff negotiations, few trade experts were expecting a deal to come to fruition.\n\nIn a social media post late in the U.S. evening on Tuesday, President Trumpdeclaredthat he had reached a “massive” trade deal with Japan. Japan had agreed to open its markets to more imports of American cars and rice, as well as invest $550 billion in the United States, he said.\n\nIn return, the president said, Japanese exports to the United States would be charged a tariff of 15 percent, lower than the 25 percent he was previously threatening. Critically, Japanese officials later said,car and auto part exportswould be subject to a 15 percent tariff, lower than a separate and damaging 25 percent tariff that Mr. Trump had already imposed on the sector.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia.\n\nPresident Trump has confirmed the U.S. has agreed to a trade deal with Japan, describing it as the “largest in history” and sending markets flying.\n\nWith the Oval Office confirming the deal last night, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was up 3.5% in trading today with the Japanese yen holding steady at 0.0068 JPY to the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.6% this morning with Germany’s DAX up near 0.9%.\n\nTouting the agreement as a “great deal for everybody,” the president took toTruth Social, his social media site, to share some of the early details: “Japan will invest … $550 billion into the United States, which will receive 90% of the profits.”\n\nHe added: “Perhaps most importantly, Japan will open their country to trade including cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products, and other things.”\n\nMoreover, Japanese exports to the U.S. will facetariffs of 15%—well below the 24% Trump first threatened on “Liberation Day.”\n\n“This is a very exciting time for the United States of America, and especially for the fact that we will continue to always have a great relationship with the country of Japan,” Trump added.\n\nThe news that the White House is still signing deals with key trading partners with a little over a week until Aug. 1—the date outlined in the president’s so-called letter tariffs sent earlier this month—has boosted confidence thatmore deals could still come ahead of the deadline, wrote Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid this morning.\n\nThat being said, Reid cautioned that markets may not get theirreprieve in a timely manner. In the note seen byFortune,he added: “Collectively, this more positive trade news has really helped to ease investor fears that tariffs are about to snap back higher on August 1. But of course, the threat of much higher tariffs still remains for several large economies, including the 30% on the EU, 35% on Canada, and 50% on Brazil. And there’s also the pledge of higher sectoral tariffs, including 50% on copper, so this is far from the end just yet, and those tariffs would each have a significant impact if they did come in.\n\n“We also know from experience that we might not know the outcome until hours before the deadline, which happened in early February where the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico were postponed for 30 days on the day before they were due to be implemented.”\n\nIndeed, UBS global wealth management CIO Mark Haefele wrote in a note this morning: “The U.S.’s deal with Japan is better than market expectations, as the lower tariffs on autos could translate into a 0.4pp improvement in Japan’s real GDP growth this year and again in 2026. The deal reduces risks to Japan’s economic growth, in our view, and removes downside risks for the Japanese currency.”\n\nHowever, the bigger picture is continued uncertainty, as he added: “We expect market volatility to pick up in the lead-up to the 1 August tariff deadline, with threats to Federal Reserve independence and geopolitical uncertainty lingering in the background.”\n\nThe general take on Wall Street at present is that Trump won’t push ahead with his threats come the end of the month.\n\nGoldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius, for example, wrote in a note this week: “We don’t expect the ‘letter tariffs’ scheduled for August 1 to take effect,” while Deutsche Bank added: “It’s clear that markets aren’t pricing in the proposed August 1 rates.”\n\nBut this reliance on the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade may prove fatal, the likes of JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon have cautioned.\n\nIndeed, analysts from Deutsche Bank havewarned it’s precisely because of this confidence from the markets that President Trump may push ahead with his plan—believing that the economy may be stable enough to take the change.\n\n© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits,” Trump, 79, wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“Perhaps most importantly, Japan will open their Country to Trade including Cars and Trucks, Rice and certain other Agricultural Products, and other things.
