        "source_1": "A massive search continued Saturday for a 57-year-old Minnesota man, after an early morning attack that left a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband dead and a second Democratic lawmaker and his wife injured in separate “politically motivated” shootings, authorities said.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson identified the shooting suspect as Vance Boelter. Jacobson described him as 6-foot-1 with brown hair, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat and a dark long-sleeve collared shirt or coat.\n\nJacobson urged the public not to approach Boelter if they see him.\n\n\"You should consider him armed and dangerous, and you should call 911 immediately,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Boelter's arrest.\n\nOfficials say the suspected gunman impersonated law enforcement wearing a vest, blue long-sleeve shirt, and what looked like a badge to gain access to the legislators’ homes.\n\nNBC News has obtained several new photos investigators in Minnesota believe they have found of Boelter at the home of at least one victim. Two of the photos show a man at the door of a home in a long-sleeve shirt and what appears to be a vest that looks similar to the bulletproof vests often worn by law enforcement.\n\nOne of the photos obtained by NBC News appears to match an image the FBIreleased on X, showing a man at the door but zoomed in closer to his face and less pixelated. It appears the man may have been wearing a mask or a bald cap, based on the creases on his face.\n\nAnother photo is a blurry image of a man walking alone and wearing a cowboy hat, similar to a photo shown by law enforcement at a press conference identifying Boelter.\n\nInvestigators towed an SUV allegedly belonging to the suspect that either looks like or is a police vehicle — equipped with flashing lights, ramming bumper, spotlight and more.\n\nState Rep. Melissa Hortman of Brooklyn Park and her husband, Mark, were killed in \"what appeared to be a politically motivated assassination,\" Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference.\n\nState Sen. John Hoffman of Champlin and his wife, Yvette, were severely injured, Walz said. They remain hospitalized and their conditions were not immediately available.\n\nBoth lawmakers were members of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and their respective homes are located about 8 miles apart, in the suburbs north of Minneapolis.\n\n\"This was an act of targeted political violence,\" Walz said. \"Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.\"\n\nSpeaking to NBC affiliateKARE of Minneapolis, Boelter's friend and roommate said the suspect sent him a text message around 6 a.m. indicating he might die.\n\n\"I may be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know that I love you guys both, and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,\" the messages read, according to Carlson.\n\nAmid questions about the suspect's ideology, KARE reported Carlson as saying Boelter was a supporter of President Donald Trump. However, Carlson told the station he wasn’t aware of his friend’s stance on local politicians.\n\nNBC News spoke to a Minnesota Democratic legislator who said they were “beyond devastated” by the shootings. They said they were currently in hiding and safe and asked not to be named out of fear for their safety.\n\nJeff Blodgett — a St. Paul-based Democratic strategist who was a campaign manager for the late Sen. Paul Wellstone and the state director for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns — knew Melissa Hortman well. He described her as a \"tremendous leader.\"\n\n\"This is obviously the result of some sick, angry mind who thinks they have to play out their politics with a gun,\" Blodgett said.\n\nPolice responded to Hoffman's home in Champlin about 2 a.m. Law enforcement in Brooklyn Park then went to check \"proactively\" on Hortman at her home since she is also a lawmaker in the area, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said at Saturday's news conference. What appeared to be bullet holes were found on the home's red front door.\n\nAround 3:35 a.m., Brooklyn Park police officers encountered an individual who \"immediately fired at them,\" said Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. They exchanged gunfire before the suspect fled out of the back of the house, authorities said.\n\nBruley said they found a \"manifesto\" inside the suspect's vehicle and with the names of other lawmakers and officials. It's unclear who is on the list.\n\nThe list targeted prominent people in Minnesota who advocate for reproductive rights, including many Democratic lawmakers who have been outspoken about their positions in favor of reproductive rights, an official who has seen the list told NBC News.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in Minnesota were at locations of those individuals to provide security and protection while the investigation into any potential list is ongoing, according to a senior law enforcement official.\n\n\"We have people of interest that we are looking for,\" Bruley said.\n\nPresident Trump said Saturday morning that he was briefed on the shooting and that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are assisting in the investigation.\n\n\"They will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.\"\n\nHortman, 55, a former State House speaker, was a DFL leader and co-author of several pieces of legislation this session, including a constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights under the law to all individuals and a bill condemning Trump’s pardons of violent Jan. 6 offenders.\n\nHoffman is the chief author of an omnibus bill this session that touched on issues such as aging and older adult services.\n\nIn a social media post, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., called the shootings “a stunning act of violence.”\n\n“I’m thankful for all the law enforcement who are responding in real time,”she wrote on X. “My prayers are with the Hortman and Hoffman families. Both legislators are close friends and devoted to their families and public service.”\n\nThe shootings are the latest in a string of seeminglylone-wolf,politically motivated violence.\n\nLast year, there were two assassination attempts against Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. The first was at a rally in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, in July by a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killedby a Secret Service sharpshooter.\n\nRyan Routh, 59, has been charged on suspicion of assassination attempt after being found camping out with a firearm where Trump was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial later this year.\n\nIn other acts of violence, in January a soldier detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas. In April, asuspect set fireto Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home over his position on Israel and Palestinians. In May, twoIsraeli embassy staffers were shot deadoutside Washington, D.C.’s Capital Jewish Museum. Also in May, acar bombingoutside a California fertility clinic killed one person, inspired by anti-natalist ideologies.\n\nSaturday’s shootings also came on the same day assweeping rallies took place nationwide,including in Minnesota, in opposition to Trump and organized under the slogan “No Kings.” A major parade was also held in Washington, D.C., in the evening in honor of the Army’s 250th birthday, coinciding with Trump’s 79th birthday.\n\nThe “No Kings” event in northeast Minnesota was canceled, and Minnesota State Patrol asked people to stay away from public demonstrations while a suspect is on the loose.\n\nFliers were found inside the suspect’s vehicle with the writing, “No Kings,” police said in aphoto shared on X, though it is unclear if there is any connection to the protests.\n\n“Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today’s planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” the state patrol said.\n\nFormer Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, a shooting survivor who now advocates for gun safety, said she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the latest violence against lawmakers.\n\n\"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself,\" she said in a statement. \"Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"\n\nErik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.\n\nMirna Alsharif is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.\n\nTom Winter is NBC’s National Law Enforcement and Intelligence Correspondent.\n\nJonathan Dienst is chief justice contributor for NBC News and chief investigative reporter for WNBC-TV in New York.",
        "source_2": "A manhunt is under way in Minnesota after two state lawmakers were targeted and one of them killed on Saturday morning in what Governor Tim Walz called an \"act of targeted political violence\".\n\nMelissa Hortman, 55, a Democrat, and her husband were killed in Brooklyn Park, a city near Minneapolis.\n\nJohn Hoffman, 60, also a Democrat, and his wife were shot several times at their home about 15km (nine miles) away in a related attack. He is out of surgery and stable.\n\nA search is on for the suspect who police say was impersonating an officer. He has been named as Vance Luther Boelter, 57 and there is a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nThe roads around the scene in suburban Brooklyn Park were quiet on Saturday night, with a discreet police presence and little sign locally of the manhunt for the suspect.\n\nBoelter served on the state's workforce development board with Hoffman, a state senator, but officials are still investigating whether he knew either politician.\n\nPolice said he tricked his way into the victims' homes using a false badge and uniform and was even driving a car that looks like a police vehicle equipped with emergency lights.\n\nThe first emergency call was made at 02:00 local time regarding the incident involving state senator Hoffman and his wife.\n\nThen another call was placed to police at 03:35, which led officers to check on House Speaker Hortman.\n\nThe police exchanged gunfire with the suspect at Hortman's home, but he managed to escape.\n\nBrooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said police are engaged in an \"extensive manhunt\" alongside the FBI, SWAT and hundreds of police officers. He said police took the suspect's car and believe he is travelling on foot.\n\nAuthorities are warning people in the area not to answer their door for a police officer unless there are two officers together.\n\nElected officials across the state were put on alert and \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump were called off after flyers for the demonstrations were found in his car.\n\nIn a statement, Trump said \"such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" and authorities would be \"prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law\".\n\nBob Jacobson, the state's commissioner of public safety, said public servants have been \"targeted in a violent and cowardly way\".\n\nSaturday was a \"dark day\" for Minnesota, but \"we will not allow fear or violence to define who we are or how we move forward\", he said.\n\nWalz activated the State Emergency Operations Center - used for managing disasters or emergencies - in response to the shootings.\n\nThe governor said Minnesota had lost a \"great leader and I lost the dearest of friends\".\n\nHe called Hortman \"a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota\", saying \"she woke up every day determined to make the state a better place\".\n\nFormer Vice-President Al Gore also paid tribute to Hortman, who briefly worked for him while he was a member of the US Senate.\n\n\"Though she was only there for a short time, she had a lasting impact,\" said Mr Gore. \"There is absolutely no excuse for political violence.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added in a statement that she was \"heartbroken\" by the targeted shootings.\n\n\"This climate of politically-motivated violence must end,\" said Mrs Pelosi, whose husband was attacked during a politically-motivated break-in at their home in 2022.\n\nHortman, an attorney, was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2004, and served as House Speaker from 2019 to 2025.\n\nShe \"led efforts to protect women's rights, invest in clean energy, and secure free school lunch for kids\", said US Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, in a statement.\n\nIn 2020, she became an advocate for policing reform in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, successfully helping to enact a state ban on police choke holds that caused Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\nShe had two children. Her husband, Mark, was also killed.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",
        "source_3": "A Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were killed, and another politician and his wife seriously hurt, in a “politically motivated assassination” after a madman who had “No Kings” flyers and posed as a police officer turned up at their homes overnight and opened fire, authorities said.\n\nFormer Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were gunned down in their Brooklyn Park home around 2 a.m., while Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were injured in a similar shooting at their home just five miles away, authorities said.\n\nThe killer is still on the loose despite exchanging gunfire with officers who responded to Hortman’s home and briefly cornered him inside — though he left behind a “manifesto” listing the names of other politicians and a stack of papers stating “No Kings” in reference to the nationwide anti-Trump protests.\n\nAuthorities are now searching for Vance Luther Boelter, who was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz to serve a four year stint on the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, in connection with the shooting, police source said.\n\nThe gunman first arrived at Hoffman’s Brooklyn Park home just outside Minneapolis, leaving the couple seriously hurt before moving on to Hortman’s house, officials said.\n\nAfter responding to Hoffman’s home, Champlin police notified their counterparts in nearby Brooklyn Park, where Melissa Hortman, 55, resides, alerting them to check on the lawmaker, police Chief Mark Bruley said at a Saturday news conference.\n\n“When they arrived at Melissa’s house, they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house,” Bruley said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest, a badge and other equipment, such as a Taser, “very similar to mine.”\n\n“When our officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home,” he continued.\n\n“It was not a real police officer. This is someone that clearly had been impersonating a police officer who uses the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.”\n\nThe suspect managed to flee, said authorities, who called the shootings “targeted.”\n\nMelissa Hortman was declared dead at the scene. Her husband, Mark, was initially alive as police entered the home, but died as first responders tried to deliver life-saving measures. The couple had two children.\n\nThe Hoffmans, who were each pumped with multiple bullets, were rushed into surgery and are in stable condition, officials said.\n\nWalz called the shootings “an unspeakable tragedy,” and said the incident “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nA manhunt is on for the suspect, who was wearing black body armor over a blue shirt and blue pants.\n\nInside his car, cops found a “manifesto that identified many other lawmakers and other officials,” Bruley said, though officials would not reveal which political players were mentioned or any other details about the document.\n\nThe gunman also left behind a stack of papers stating “No Kings” in the car.\n\nThere were numerous protests planned for Minnesota, as well as the rest of the country, for the event, which organizers described as “a national day of action and mass mobilization in response to the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration.”\n\n“Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today’s planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,”the Minnesota State Patrol said on Facebook.\n\nHortman had served in the state House of Representatives since 2004, was minority leader from 2017 to 2019, and worked as the speaker from 2019 through February. The progressive, pro-choice Democrat often spoke out in favor of trans rights.\n\nJust five days before the murders, Hortman faced intense criticism for voting to cut access to state health benefits for illegal immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nShe was the only Democrat to side with Republicans, providing the GOP with the carrying vote. Walz indicated he intends to sign the measure when it lands on his desk.\n\nThe vote came after weeks of negotiations for a budget compromise, and the GOP made it clear they would not be satisfied without the MinnesotaCare repeal.\n\nHortman was reduced to tears after she cast her affirmative vote, saying: “I know that people will be hurt by that vote and we worked very hard to get a budget deal that didn’t include that provision,” adding that she understood her fellow caucus members were frustrated with her decision.\n\n“They’re right to be mad at me,” she said, “I think some of them are pretty, pretty angry. I think that their job was to make folks who voted for that bill feel like crap, and I think that they succeeded.”\n\nHoffman, 60, was one of 16 who did not approve the measure on the state Senate side.\n\nCops ordered a shelter-in-place for the three-mile radius surrounding the Edinburgh Golf Course near Melissa Hortman’s home.\n\n“Police are looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,” Brooklyn Park Police said in an emergency alert sent to residents at 5:30 a.m.\n\n“Suspect is white male, brown hair, wearing black body armor over blue shirt and blue pants and may misrepresent himself as law enforcement.”\n\nUS Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was “heartbroken and horrified” by Hortman’s death.\n\n“She was a true public servant to the core, dedicating her life to serving Minnesotans with integrity and compassion,” Klobuchar wrote on X."
