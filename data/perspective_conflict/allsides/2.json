Even in the face of danger was he diligent in his duty to protect our community,\" the police department said in a statement posted online late Friday night.\n\nAt the earlier press conference, Lorraine Cochran-Johnson, DeKalb County CEO, said it was a \"dark day\" for the county. The officer leaves behind a wife, who is pregnant, and two children, she said.\n\nThe gunfire broke out at 4:50 p.m., prompting a shelter-in-place order at the university and a lockdown at the CDC headquarters.\n\nResponding DeKalb County police officers located the suspect on the second floor of the Emory Point CVS Pharmacy across the street from the CDC building and attempted to engage the person when gunfire was exchanged, police said.\n\nDuring the shooting, the suspect fired multiple rounds at CDC buildings, breaking windows, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said during an earlier press conference\n\nIn a video call with employees on Saturday morning, CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez shared her concern for the staff and said she wanted to let them know they are supported by the agency.

Kennedy said the shooting was \"a reminder of the very human challenges public servants sometimes face — even in places dedicated to healing and progress.\"\n\nIn astatement on X, Kennedy said, \"We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others. We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency. Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty.\"\n\nThere were 92 children at a day care center on the CDC campus at the time, who were unharmed, police added.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, four other people were transported to an area hospital for stress and anxiety-related reasons, the police chief said.\n\nShortly after the shooting was reported, a shelter-in-place order was put in place on the Emory University campus and later lifted. \"RUN. HIDE. FIGHT. Avoid the area,\" the university said in an alert Friday afternoon.\n\nGeorgia Gov.

        "source_2": "Investigators say that the man who opened fire on the headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, killing a police officer, may have been opposed to Covid vaccinations.\n\nOfficer David Rose, 33, who graduated from the police academy in March, died in hospital after he was wounded. No civilians were injured.\n\nOfficials told US media on Saturday that they were looking into the theory that the suspect, Patrick Joseph White, 30, was ill, or thought he was ill from a Covid vaccine. White died in the incident.\n\nThe CDC, which tracks outbreaks of illness in the US, played a central role during the Covid pandemic and has been heavily-criticised by vaccine sceptics.\n\nOfficer Rose was a former Marine who had served in Afghanistan.\n\nDeKalb County official Lorraine Cochran-Johnson said: \"This evening, there is a wife without a husband. There are three children, one unborn, without a father.\"\n\nMedia reports suggested the gunman's father had called police on the day of the shooting, believing his son was suicidal.\n\nA neighbour of Whitetold the Atlanta Journal-Constitutionthat the suspect had mentioned to her repeatedly that he distrusted Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nNancy Hoalst, who lives across the street from White's family in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, told the newspaper: \"He was very unsettled and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people. He emphatically believed that.\"\n\nA neighbour who spoke to CBS, the BBC's US partner, said that the suspect was very skinny and was adamant that the Covid vaccine made him sick.\n\nHis \"beliefs were core to who he became,\" she added.\n\nCDC Director Susan Monarez said the centre was \"heartbroken\" by the attack.\n\n\"DeKalb County police, CDC security, and Emory University responded immediately and decisively, helping to prevent further harm to our staff and community,\" she wrote in a post on X.\n\nIn a press briefing on Friday, police said they became aware of a report of an active shooter about 16:50 local time (20:50 GMT) that day near the CDC.\n\nOfficers from multiple agencies responded. The CDC campus received a number of rounds of gunfire into its buildings.\n\nPolice said they found the shooter \"struck by gunfire\" - but could not specify whether that was from law enforcement or self-inflicted.\n\nSecretary of Health Robert Kennedy Jr issued a statement saying the agency was \"deeply saddened\" by the attack that claimed an officer's life.\n\n\"We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No-one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,\" said Kennedy.\n\nKennedy has previously expressed doubts about the side effects of vaccines, especially Covid vaccines, and has been accused of spreading misinformation.\n\nSome former CDC employees who were fired as part of Elon Musk's campaign to shrink the government rejected Kennedy's statement.\n\n\"Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC's workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,\" one ex-employee wrote,according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\nAnother former CDC employee told the outlet that the shooting was the \"physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers\".\n\nMedia outlets have reported that CDC employees have been asked to work remotely on Monday.",
        "source_3": "A cop was killed when an unhinged masked gunman who blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for an apparent illness unleashed a hail of bullets outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, according to police and reports.\n\nThe deranged suspect, who died at the scene, opened fire on at least four CDC buildings and then stormed into a building across the street that houses a CVS at Georgia’s Emory University around 4:50 p.m., forcing students to shelter in place on the last day of the summer term, authorities said.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said the alleged shooter, described as a white man, sprayed multiple rounds at law enforcement and the health agency, which also houses a daycare caring for 92 children, all of whom were unharmed.\n\nWitnesses said the shooter was armed with multiple guns – two handguns, a rifle, and a shotgun – and was wearing what appeared to be a surgical mask when he “targeted” at the CDC’s buildings, CNN reported.\n\nOne CDC employee told the outlet he was leaving work when he saw the suspected gunman approach the steps of the agency’s campus, set down a backpack, and fire away at the building.\n\n“We have friends and their kids who were on lockdown,” the unidentified worker said, adding that he heard at least seven shots when he called his wife to make sure his children, who attend the agency’s daycare, were safe.\n\n“I have very close colleagues who were locked down in the office at CDC, you know, cowering or sort of sheltering in place.”\n\nChilling photos shared on social mediashowed bullet holes piercing the windows of the health agency’s headquarters, located right next to the university.\n\nThe CDC campus remained on lockdown for hours after the shooting, as officials investigated and worked to reunite the daycare’s children with their parents, officials said.\n\n“We at the CDC are heartbroken by today’s attack on our Roybal Campus,” health officials said in a statement.\n\n“A courageous local law enforcement officer gave their life… after a gunman opened fire on at least four CDC buildings. Our top priority is the safety and well-being of everyone at CDC. We are actively coordinating with federal, state, and local partners to fully investigate the shooter and this tragic crime.”\n\nThe crazed gunman was later found on the second floor of the CVS building with a fatal gunshot wound, after shooting DeKalb County officer David Rose, police said.\n\nThe heroic officer, who leaves behind his pregnant wife and two children, was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\n“This evening, there is a wife without a husband,” DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson said at a press conference, where officers praised their fallen brother’s unwavering commitment to his community.\n\n“There are three children, one unborn, without a father. There is a mother and a father, as well as siblings who also share in this traumatic loss. Let’s join together to give this family the support it needs during this traumatic loss.”\n\nNo other civilians or police were injured in the shooting.\n\nPolice said they have not yet determined whether the gunman’s fatal gunshot was self-inflicted.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens ominously said that the shooter “is a known person that may have some interest in certain things that I can’t reiterate right now.”\n\nThe suspect’s father, however, had alerted authorities that he believed his son was suicidal shortly before the shooting, CNN reported.\n\nWhile it wasn’t immediately clear how much time had passed between the call and the brazen attack, law enforcement told the outlet the shooter was possibly sick, attributing the supposed ailment to the COVID-19 vaccine, according to police interviews with the suspect’s family.\n\nPolice have not publicly disclosed a motive behind the vicious shooting.\n\nShortly after gunshots erupted, Emory University officials issued an urgent alert around 5 p.m., reporting an active shooter near the Emory Point CVS on campus and urging all students to “RUN” and “HIDE.”\n\nLocal, state and federal officers swarmed the scene, with horrifyingsocial media videosshowing a rapid barrage of gunfire as first responders raced to the college.\n\nInone video filmedby a nearby resident, eight gunshots ring out, followed by a brief pause, then more than a dozen pop in rapid succession.\n\n“It sounded like fireworks going off, one right after the other,” Brandy Giraldo, the owner of a nearby deli,told the Associated Press.\n\nOne police cruiser at the scene also appeared to have been hit by about a dozen gunshots to its windshield and hood.\n\nOne photo taken at the terrifying scene shows what appears to be a man lying lifeless on a stretcher beside an ambulance surrounded by dozens of police officers.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the person pictured is the alleged shooter.\n\nStudents were advised to shelter in place as the terror unfolded, with the lockdown lifted by 6:30 p.m.\n\n“We are horrified by the news out of Emory University and praying for the safety of the entire campus community,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carrsaid on X.\n\n“We stand ready to assist our law enforcement partners with whatever they may need.”"
