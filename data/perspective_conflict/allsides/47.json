To respond in full. And if necessary, launch preemptive strikes,\" he added.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev attend a cabinet meeting in Moscow, Jan. 15, 2020.(Alexei Nikolsky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nSENATE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS REPUBLICANS READY TO MOVE ON RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL WHEN TRUMP GIVES GREEN LIGHT\n\nMedvedev’s comments come just two days after PresidentDonald Trumpannounced secondary tariffs on Moscow by slapping 100% tariffs on nations that purchase Russian oil if the Kremlin does not enter into a peace agreement with Ukraine within the next 50 days.\n\nReports also surfaced this week claiming that Trump had mulled the possibility of Ukraine hitting the Russian capital while in a call with Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyearlier this month. Kyiv would not comment on the issue and the White House said the question was taken \"out of context\" and was not an attempt at \"encouraging further killing.\"\n\nTrump this week said the U.S. would be sendingPatriot missilesto NATO nations that would then be routed to Ukraine, and on Wednesday he suggested the sophisticated weaponry was already en route to Germany.\n\n\"They're already being shipped,\" Trump told reporters from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. \"They're coming in from Germany and then replaced by Germany. And in all cases, the United States gets paid back in full.\"\n\nBut the timing of the weapons delivery systems and where exactly they are being routed to remains unclear as a spokesman for Germany’s defense ministry on Thursday told reporters he had no knowledge of such an incoming shipment.\n\n\"I cannot confirm that anything is currently on the way. That is not known to me,\" the spokesman reportedly told Swissbroadcasting outlet SRF, before noting that a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will be held on Monday, when delivery specifications of U.S. Patriot systems will be hashed out.\n\nUkrainian and German soldiers train on the Patriot air defense missile system at a military training area in Germany in June 2024.(Jens Büttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nPUTIN MUM ON TRUMP'S 50-DAY ULTIMATUM, KREMLIN OFFICIALS CLAIM RUSSIA 'DIDN'T CARE'\n\nBut the quick delivery of the U.S. missile systems appears to be a top priority for Washington and NATO as Switzerland, which is not a NATO nation, also announced on Thursday that its anticipated receipt of five Patriot batteries, purchased from the U.S. in 2022 with a pledged delivery date to begin in 2026, had been delayed.\n\n\"The United States Department of Defense has informed the (Swiss Defense Ministry) that it will reprioritize the delivery of Patriot systems to support Ukraine, focusing on ground-based air defense,\" theministry saidin a statement.\n\n\"No statement can be made at this stage regarding the exact timing and any further implications for Switzerland,\" the ministry added. \"Clarifications are ongoing.\"\n\nMedvedev on Thursday said the action byNATOamounted to a full-blown war against Russia by the West.\n\n\"What is happening today is a proxy war, but in essence it is a full-scale war (launches of Western missiles, satellite intelligence, etc.), sanctions packages, loud statements about the militarization of Europe,\" he told the Russian media outlet.\n\nThough the push to send Patriot systems and threats to sanction Moscow are significant as it is the first time since Trump entered office that he has looked to start actively countering Russian PresidentVladimir Putin’swar effort, not everyone is convinced it is strong enough.\n\nEU leaders earlier in the weekcommented on the length of timethe president allotted for Putin despite months of diplomacy failing to yield real action on the battlefield.\n\nSoldiers of the 30th Prince Konstanty Ostrogski Mechanized Brigade fire a missile from a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher at Russian troops positions in the Donetsk direction, Ukraine, on June 3, 2025.(Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAndZelenskyynoted that 50 days of waiting means another 50 days of death for Ukrainian citizens.\n\n\"Fifty days, for us, is just – every day is scary,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview withthe New York Postreleased on Thursday.\n\n\"Putin has wasted President Trump’s time,\" he added. \"I would very much like to see the United States, the Congress and the president put some pressure on this situation with sanctions and so the sooner, the faster it can be done, the better.\"\n\n\"We would certainly like to speed up this process,\" Zelenskyy added. \"We, for our part, will work to provide more information [to Trump], more arguments for strong sanctions against Russia.\"\n\nFox News Digital could not immediately reach the Pentagon or Germany's Defense Ministry for comment.\n\nCaitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.\n\nFox News' Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
