        "source_1": "Updated on:  February 21, 2025 / 8:54 PM EST/ CBS News\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to make Hamas pay \"the full price\" for what he called a \"cruel and wicked violation\" of the tenuousGaza ceasefireagreement after the Israeli and U.S.-designated terrorist group returned the remains of a Gazan womaninstead of an Israeli mothertaken hostage with her two young children.\n\nIsraeli officials said late Thursday evening that Hamas had handed over the body of an unidentified Gazan woman earlier in the day instead of the remains of Shiri Bibas as expected. In a handover orchestrated under the ceasefire deal that came into effect on Jan. 19, Hamas was supposed to return the bodies on Thursday of Bibas along with her two slain sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, who at just nine months old was the youngest of the 251 Israelis seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.\n\nThe children's remains were returned, along with the body of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83, but Netanyahu said that instead of Shiri Bibas' remains, Hamas \"put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin.\"\n\n\"May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas be etched in the heart of the nation forever,\" he said. \"May God avenge their blood. And so will we.\"\n\nHamas hasclaimed since November 2023that Shiri Bibas, her children and Lifshitz were all killed in Israeli bombing in Gaza, along with some militants who were holding them captive. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He wasreleased earlier this monthafter 16 months in captivity.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Hamas indicated the handover of a different body the previous day could have been a mistake, claiming there was a \"possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies, which may have resulted from the occupation targeting and bombing the place where the family was located.\"\n\nThe statement said Hamas would look at \"these claims with complete seriousness, and we will announce the results clearly,\" and it added that the group wished to, \"confirm our seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations, and we have proven this through our behavior during the past days. We have no interest in not committing [to the ceasefire terms] or keeping any bodies with us.\"\n\nHamas called on Israel to return the remains of the unidentified Gazan woman to the decimated Palestinian territory.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces issued a terse statement Friday rejecting Hamas' claim that the Bibas children were killed in an IDF strike.\n\n\"Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood,\" the IDF alleged. \"The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys — they killed them with their bare hands. Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities. This assessment is based on both forensic findings from the identification process, and intelligence that supports the findings.\"\n\nThe incident, along with previous hostage handovers that have seen large crowds of well-armed Hamas terrorists and civilians crowding around freed Israelis and, on Thursday for instance, a massive propaganda poster behind the coffins holding the hostages' remains depicting Netanyahu as a bloody vampire, have drawn fury from Israeli officials and the Trump administration.\n\nThe handovers have also been increasingly criticized by the international community — including by the Red Cross, which has facilitated the physical transfer of hostages, both living and dead, inside Gaza. In a Friday statement to Reuters, the global organization said it was \"concerned and unsatisfied\" with the way the releases have played out.\n\n\"The ICRC does not participate in sorting, screening, or examining the deceased — this is the responsibility of the parties to the conflict,\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said, according to Reuters, adding concern that the Thursday transfer of remains had not been carried out in a private and dignified manner.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres alsoissued a statementcondemning \"the parading of bodies and displaying of the coffins of the deceased Israeli hostages by Hamas on Thursday. Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families.\"\n\nRegardless of any intentionality on the part of Hamas, that handover of the wrong body and Israel's stern reaction to it left the already-fragile ceasefire in an even more perilous position Friday, just a week before the first six-week phase of the deal is set to end. A total of 33 living Israeli hostages were to be handed over during the first phase under the terms of the agreement, the final six of whom should be released Saturday.\n\nThere was no immediate indication from Israel or Hamas that Saturday's planned release, and the corresponding release by Israel of scores more Palestinian prisoners from its jails, would not go ahead.\n\nTalks to hammer out the terms of the second phase, due to begin at the start of March, should have begun a couple weeks ago, but there's been no indication from Israel, Hamas, or the U.S. and its regional partners Qatar and Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire, of what progress may or may not have been made.\n\nNetanyahu has been under constant pressure from some far-right members of his cabinet to end the ceasefire and resume Israel's military operation in Gaza, and Netanyahu himself has stressed that the goal of the war has always been to disarm, if not destroy Hamas. In that objective, Israel's government appears to have the firm backing of the Trump administration.\n\nIn aninterviewon Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Hamas, \"evil, terrible people, and the idea that they would ever be allowed to continue to have arms and to be militarized and control territory, anywhere in the world, is unfathomable.\"\n\n\"As long as Hamas is in Gaza, there will never be peace in Gaza,\" he said, \"because they are going to go back to attacking Israel, and Israel is going to have to respond.\"\n\nThe families of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have been far less eager to see a resumption of fighting, however. In a statement cited Friday by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community from which the Bibas children and their mother were abducted, said it stood by the \"clear demands of the Bibas family at this time: release, not revenge.\"\n\n\"The state must bring Shiri back by all means, in a way that will not hinder the continuation of the deal and the immediate release of all hostages,\" the kibbutz community was quoted as saying.\n\n\"Hamas is a murderous organization that does not hesitate to kill infants and toddlers. Our expectations are from the Israeli government, whose actions must be immediate to free all 70 hostages from the hands of the murderers and end the ongoing failure.\"\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of all the Israelis taken captive in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, said in a separate statement that it was \"horrified and devastated by the news\" that Shiri Bibas' remains were not returned.\n\n\"To the world, we say: Do not look away. In Hamas' hell in Gaza, 70 more of our children, brothers, sisters, and parents remain in captivity, enduring unimaginable terror. Do not abandon them to their fate. Save them from this nightmare. Every passing minute is a death sentence for those still alive and a threat to our ability to bring back the fallen for a proper burial.\n\n\"Israel and the international community must stand firm in ensuring that the agreement is upheld while acting with wisdom and urgency to address these blatant violations,\" the group said. \"Every step must be taken with careful responsibility to secure the safe return of all hostages.\"\n\nThe forum added a specific plea to President Trump, thanking him \"for his unwavering support and strong stance in the fight against terror,\" and calling on the U.S. leader \"to continue standing with us in demanding the immediate return of all hostages.\"\n\nIsrael's 15-month war against Hamas killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack that sparked the war.\n\nTucker Reals is CBSNews.com's foreign editor, based in the CBS News London bureau.

        "source_3": "Israelileaders expressed outrage about the “cruelty of theHamasmonsters” after the terrorist group handed over the anonymous body of a Palestinian woman during a recent prisoner exchange instead of the promised remains of Shiri Bibas, a dead Jewish hostage.\n\nIn accordance with a six-week ceasefire deal reached in January, Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday. While identities of the elderly Oded Lifschitz and two young children, Airel Bibas and Kfir Bibas, were confirmed, the supposed remains of their mother, Shiri Bibas, were determined by Israeli officials to be, in fact, the body of an unrelated Gazan woman.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas would pay “the full price” for violating the terms of the ceasefirein a statement Friday.\n\n“The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds. Not only did they kidnap the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unspeakably cynical manner, they did not return Shiri to her little children, the little angels, and they put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,” the Israeli leader said.\n\n“We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages, both living and dead, and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement,” he continued.\n\nThe two Bibas children were the youngest taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. They were murdered during their time in captivity by Hamas soldiers who “did not shoot the two young boys—they killed them with their bare hands,” per theIsrael Defense Forces. Their mother, Yarden, also died during her time in captivity. The children’s father was also kidnapped during the attack but was freed earlier this month during another hostage exchange.\n\nShiri Bibas and her two children were kidnapped alive from their home.Kfir (10 months) and Ariel (4) were murdered in captivity.Their bodies were returned to Israel yesterday—without their mother.Hamas is pure evil and must be eradicated.#WhereIsShiripic.twitter.com/5oQR140HXX\n\nShortly after Hamas released the bodies of the Bibas family during a shocking and staged ceremony for national television on Thursday, the IDFannounced the body believed to be Shiri Bibaswas an “anonymous, unidentified body.” The body’s DNA didn’t match that of any of the hostages, the IDF confirmed.\n\n“During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage,” the Israeli military said. “This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages. We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all our hostages.”\n\nThe news confirmed the worst fears of the surviving Bibas family, who had requested late Wednesday for the public to refrain from eulogizing their loved ones until forensic identification of the bodies was completed.\n\nHamas’ abduction of the Bibas family over two years sparked particular outrage in Israel as videos of terrorists kidnapping Shiri and her two boys went viral.\n\nThere was absolute, overwhelming HORROR in Shiri Bibas eyes, when she was kidnapped with her two little children by Hamas Monsters from hell.Hamas took this video. They made it public. They wanted the world to see. They bragged: \"Look, what we are doing. We are kidnapping a…pic.twitter.com/MWpanFEkV7\n\nVideos of Hamas releasing the children’s coffins and the supposed body of their mother this week likewise attracted visceral responses from Jews, whodecried the actas a “grotesque spectacle” and slammed Gazan spectators for cheering the display.\n\nHamas painted the coffins black and showed a superimposed image of Netanyahu as a vampire on the wall behind them before passing the bodies to Red Cross workers, who then draped the coffins with white cloth.\n\nTRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY PICKS: LOYALTY, AMERICA FIRST, AND PRO-ISRAEL\n\nIn a statement Friday, Hamas called on Israel to return the body of the Gazan woman it had handed over to the Israelis as Shiri Bibas.\n\n“We point out the possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies, which may be the result of the occupation targeting and bombing the place where the family was with other Palestinians,” Hamas said."
