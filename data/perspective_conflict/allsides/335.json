        "source_1": "A group of conservative influencers left the White House on Thursday afternoon, all holding white binders emblazoned with the Department of Justice seal. Some of them held up the binders to the cameras, which showed that they were labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1.”\n\nThe unusual scene came just hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who wasconfirmed earlier this month, vowed to release a cache of documents related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bondi had promised that the files would include flight logs and the names of individuals involved, but she had cautioned that some information could not be disclosed due to the need to protect more than 250 victims.\n\nRead More:How Longtime Epstein Watchers Reacted to the Release of the ‘Epstein Files’\n\nA review of the released documents found that they included heavy redactions and mostly information that had been previously reported. While the binders appeared to be marked “declassified,” questions remained as to whether they had ever been classified in the first place. The limited scope of the release drew criticism from some Republicans, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency.\n\n“I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook,”Luna tweeted. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!”\n\nRead More:Released ‘Epstein Files’ Disappoint Anticipators. A Republican ‘Rickroll’ Didn’t Help\n\nIn a Thursdayletter to FBI Director Kash Patel, Bondi suggested that the FBI had more documents related to Epstein’s investigation and indictment. She ordered the “full and complete” Epstein files to be delivered to her office by Friday morning, and also ordered Patel to “conduct an immediate investigation” as to why her previous order on delivering all the files wasn’t followed.\n\nAs the Epstein documents were released, Patelposted on Xthat the bureau is “entering a new era.” He added: “If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them. And we will bring everything we find to the DOJ to be fully assessed and transparently disseminated to the American people as it should be.”\n\nAmong those carrying the binders outside the White House was political commentator Rogan O’Handley, known online as DC Draino, along with Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, podcaster Liz Wheeler, and Jack Posobiec, among others. Someposted the same seemingly coordinated messageon X, including the line: “This is the most transparent administration in American history.”\n\nBondi discussed the release of the documents in aninterviewwith Fox News on Wednesday, offering a glimpse of what might be included—though she stopped short of confirming whether new revelations would emerge from the files, beyond what the public already knew. Epstein’s dark history, marked by his abuse of underage girls, has been extensively documented over the years, with multiple lawsuits, criminal dockets, and public disclosures laying bare the extent of his crimes.\n\nRead More:The Biggest Names from Jeffrey Epstein’s Unsealed Court Documents\n\nIn January 2024, a court unsealed a large batch of documents from the lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims. The materials released at that time, including police reports and victim testimonies, had already been publicly circulated.\n\nEpstein’s predatory behavior spanned more than a decade, with allegations dating back to the 1990s. He was accused of abusing hundreds of children, some as young as 14, in a sprawling operation allegedly involving high-profile individuals, including politicians, celebrities, and royalty. Epstein’s death in 2019, ruled a suicide while in a Manhattan jail awaiting trial, only fueled conspiracy theories and renewed calls for transparency.",

        "source_3": "WASHINGTON — The Justice Department released a handful of files on notorious sex traffickerJeffrey Epsteinon Thursday — though there appear to be no new names or details.\n\nThe info first went out to a hand-selected crop of right-wing social media influencers Thursday afternoon — and even those recipients were underwhelmed by what the documents revealed.\n\nA source who reviewed the files told The Post ahead of the influencers’ embargoed release that they spanned more than 100 pages of the notorious pedophile’s phone book, including a list of contacts without further context and addresses redacted.\n\nThis person added the unveiling was likely to be a “disappointment” to sleuths eager for bombshell new evidence about Epstein’s connections to prominent political and business leaders.\n\nIndeed, when the conservative social media personalities began livestreaming footage of the content after The Post’s initial report, they revealed files that were long available in the public record — such as flight logs — and that all of the boldfaced names in the contact list already were known from prior disclosures.\n\nHours later, Attorney General Pam Bondi released the documents publicly. The names in the contact book included Michael Jackson, Britain’s Prince Andrew, Mick Jagger, Ethel Kennedy (the mother of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), Alec Baldwin and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nHowever, the document appeared to be a copy of Epstein’s “black book” that was first published in 2021 and later put up for auction.\n\nA list of 254 names on another document titled “MASSEUSES” was entirely redacted.\n\nThe flight logs included in the release were made public as part of Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell’s 2021 trial.\n\nNo “client list” was included in the release, which was compiled into binders describing the disclosure as “phase one” of the Epstein files, according to The Post’s source.\n\nBondi later suggested more details will be coming. In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel made public Thursday afternoon, she claimed she had been told “the FBI Field Office in New York was in possession of thousands of pages of documents related to the investigation and indictment of Epstein.”\n\nBondi went on to demand the “full and complete Epstein files to my office, including records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients” by 8 a.m. Friday.\n\nBondi previously hinted at more dramatic revelations in a Wednesday night interview with Jesse Watters of Fox News, saying she would release “a lot of names, a lot of information — it’s pretty sick what that man did.”\n\nEpstein’s criminal activities with minors have attracted long-lasting public interest because of his deep connections to the world’s most powerful men before his downfall — including free trips aboard his “Lolita Express” jet and stays at his lush private Caribbean island.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Prince Andrew and President Trump are among the high-profile people who associated with Epstein — though Trumpreportedly bannedEpstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2007 over an incident with a club member’s teen daughter. (Trump was not named in the contact list, though some of his family members were.)\n\nCopies of the binder circulated within the West Wing Thursday morning and were distributed to 15 conservative influencers who visited the White House.\n\nOne of the influencers who obtained early access to the files, podcaster Liz Wheeler, acknowledged that the trove lacked a “bombshell.”\n\n“Now what’s interesting is we’re all waiting for bombshells,” Wheeler told followers in a livestream on X. “We’re all waiting for juicy stuff. And that’s not what’s in this binder. That’s not what’s in this binder at all. And that’s exactly how the attorney general presented it to us.”\n\n“It’s fine to feel frustrated,” she added. “You should feel frustrated.”\n\nWheeler briefly showed off portions of the binder, revealing heavily redacted pages, including a contact list, while insisting, “what we were looking for was hidden from us.”\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, demanded more information.\n\n“I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook,”Luna tweeted.\n\n“THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!”\n\nSome of Epstein’s address books have already been made public, and it’s unclear if the document dump will include fresh information.\n\nA 97-page address bookpublished by Gawker in 2015included names, addresses and phone numbers of 221 people.\n\nA different address book from 1997 wasput up for auctionlast year but failed to sell.\n\nThat 64-page book listed 349 people including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., NewsNation anchor Chris Cuomo’s wife Cristina Greeven, actress Morgan Fairchild and billionaire Carl Icahn.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10, 2019, from what authorities deemed a suicide.\n\nAt the time, the 66-year-old was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges of child sex trafficking and perjury, among other counts.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
