        "source_1": "Joe Biden describes as ‘outrageous’ the warrants for Israeli PM and former defence minister, which put them at risk of detention if they go to some other countries\n\nThe international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s former defence minister Yoav Gallant and theHamas military leader Mohammed Deiffor alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war.\n\nIt is the first time that leaders of a democracy and western-aligned state have been charged by the court, in the most momentous decision of its 22-year history.\n\nNetanyahu and Gallant are at risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the Rome statute establishing the court.Israelclaims to have killed Deif in an airstrike in July, but the court’s pre-trial chamber said it would “continue to gather information” to confirm his death.\n\nThe chamber ruled there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility as co-perpetrators for “the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”.\n\nThe three-judge panel also said it had found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, torture, rape and hostage taking relating to theHamasattack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which fighters killed more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and kidnapped 250.\n\nThe US criticised the move, with Joe Biden describing the warrants in a statement on Thursday night as “outrageous”.\n\n“Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence – none – between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.”\n\nNetanyahu’s office denounced the chamber’s decision as “antisemitic”.\n\n“Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the international criminal court, a biased and discriminatory political body,” the office said in a statement, adding that “no war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza”.\n\nThe statement pointed to an investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct against the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan who sought the charges against the three men in May. Khan, 54, has denied the allegations and said he will cooperate with the investigation.\n\nNetanyahu said in a video statement: “No outrageous anti-Israel decision will prevent us – and it will not prevent me – from continuing to defend our country in every way. We will not yield to pressure.”\n\nThe US national security council issued a statement “fundamentally” rejecting the court’s decision. “We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision,” the statement said, without any detail of the alleged errors.\n\n“The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter. In coordination with partners, including Israel, we are discussing next steps.”\n\nThe US has previously welcomed ICC war crimes warrants against Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials for atrocities committed in Ukraine, exposing the Biden administrationto accusations of double standards from many UN members, particularly from the global south.\n\nNetanyahu can expect more resounding support from the incoming Donald Trump administration. During his first term, in 2020, Trump imposed US sanctions on the ICC, aimed at court officials and their families. The then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made clear the sanctions were imposed because the ICC had begun investigating the actions of the US and its allies in Afghanistan, as well as Israeli military operations in the occupied territories.\n\nThe UK is expected to agree to the request to arrest Netanyahu if he came to Britain, although Downing Street refused to directly confirm this, saying only that it would “respect” the court’s independence. A spokesperson said a UK-based court procedure would be needed to approve any request.\n\nThe panel said the full version of the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant were secret “in order to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of the investigations”, but the judges released much of their reasoning. This focused on the obstruction of the supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it judged to be deliberate.\n\n“The chamber considered that there are reasonable grounds to believe that both individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity,” the written ruling said.\n\nThe warrants were broadly welcomed by human rights groups. Balkees Jarrah, an associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said they would “break through the perception” that certain individuals were beyond the reach of the law.\n\n“Whether the ICC can effectively deliver on its mandate will depend on governments’ willingness to support justice no matter where abuses are committed and by whom,” Jarrah said. “These warrants should finally push the international community to address atrocities and secure justice for all victims in Palestine and Israel.”\n\nIsrael has denied committing war crimes in Gaza and has rejected the jurisdiction of the court. However, the pretrial chamber noted that Palestine had been recognised as a member of the court in 2015, so the ICC did not require Israeli approval to investigate crimes on Palestinian territory.\n\nThe chamber also rejected an Israeli appeal for the warrants to be deferred, saying the Israeli authorities were informed of an earlier ICC investigation in 2021, and at that time, “Israel elected not to pursue any request for deferral of the investigation”.\n\nAn ICC statement said of Deif that “the chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Deif … is responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, torture and rape and other form of sexual violence, as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other forms of sexual violence”.\n\nKhan had sought warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, but they were killed in the conflict. Israel’s claim to have killed Deif has been neither confirmed nor denied by Hamas.\n\nBenny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, condemned the ICC’s decision, saying it showed “moral blindness” and was a “shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten”. Yair Lapid, another opposition leader, called it a “prize for terror”.\n\nThe warrants have been issued at a sensitive moment for Khan, in the face of an investigation of claims of sexual misconduct. The inquiry will examine the allegations against the prosecutor, which,the Guardian reported last month, include claims of unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged victim, an ICC lawyer in her 30s, has previously declined to comment.\n\nThe arrest warrants could increase the external pressure on Netanyahu’s government as the US seeks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but could well strengthen the prime minister’s political position in Israel in the short term, as most Israelis reject the ICC’s jurisdiction, regarding it as interference in their country’s internal affairs.\n\nBiden has said he does not believe Netanyahu is doing enough to secure a ceasefire, after the Israeli leader vowed not to compromise on Israeli control over strategic territory inside Gaza. Netanyahu has accused Hamas of failing to negotiate in good faith.",

The threat of arrest could make it difficult for Netanyahu and Gallant to travel abroad, although Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently showed he could still visit an ally when he travelled to Mongolia, one of the court’s member states, and was not arrested.\n\nNetanyahu rejected \"with disgust\" what he labelled as an \"antisemitic\" warrant, saying there was \"nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza” in a statement released by his office on Thursday.\n\nOther Israeli leaders, including President Isaac Herzog, former PM Naftali Bennett, ministers Gideon Saar and Itamar Ben-Gvir, and opposition leader Yair Lapid, also condemned the court's decision.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are not political and that the court's decision should be respected and implemented.\n\n\"It is not a political decision, it is a decision of a court, of a court of justice, an international court of justice. And the decision of the court has to be respected and implemented.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Hamas welcomed the ICC's arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant and said they were an important step towards justice. The decision marked an \"important historical precedent and a correction to a long history of injustice,\" the letter said, urging the court to hold all \"criminal occupation leaders\" accountable.\n\nThe tribunal ruled that Deif's warrant was \"classified as ‘secret’ to protect witnesses and safeguard the conduct of investigations.\"\n\nDeif was one of the reported masterminds of the 7 October attack last year. In July, the Israeli military claimed to have killed the Hamas commander in an airstrike in Gaza, but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied these claims.\n\nThe tribunal's chief prosecutor had also sought warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, but they were both killed in the conflict.",

(Video: UNTV)\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected challenges from Israel and issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday.\n\nThe ICC chargedNetanyahu and Gallantwith \"crimes against humanity and war crimes,\" including using starvation as a method of warfare and targeting civilians. Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the move in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"Taken in bad faith, the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughingstock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice – from the Allied victory over the Nazis till today,\" Herzog wrote.\n\nHerzog argued that the ICC's decision ignores Hamas' use of human shields and its Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks that started the war, as well as the Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\n'CHEERLEADING FOR TERRORISM': TWITCH STAR CALLED FOR NEW 9/11, DISMISSED HORROR OF OCT 7\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant now face arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court.(Reuters/Pool)\n\n\"Indeed, the decision has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity,\" he added. \"This cynical exploitation of the international legal institutions reminds us once again of the need for true moral clarity in the face of an Iranian empire of evil that seeks to destabilize our region and the world, and destroy the very institutions of the free world.\"\n\nBIDEN REVERSES TRUMP, LIFTS SANCTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT\n\nIsrael madeseveral efforts to block the ICC from approving the arrest warrants. They first argued that the ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel, but the court said it could issue the arrest warrants as part of the \"territorial jurisdication of Palestine.\"\n\nIsrael also made other procedural challenges, but they were rejected.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the ICC for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.(AP/Ben Curtis)\n\nThe ICC's move comes just days after Senate Majority Leader-elect John Thune threatened to hit the court with sanctions if it moved forward with the arrest warrants.\n\nThune – who was selected last week to be the next Senate majority leader once the GOP takes the upper chamber come January 2025 – warned that if the current Democratic leader does not take on the international court, he will.\n\nISRAELI OFFICIAL PRAISES STEFANIK AS UN PICK, SAYS HER 'MORAL CLARITY' WILL COMBAT BODY'S 'HATE AND LIES'\n\n\"If the ICC and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials, the Senate should immediately pass sanctions legislation, as the House has already done on a bipartisan basis,\" Thune wrote on X. \"If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress.\"\n\n(Sen. John Thune, right, urged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to take action against the ICC.)\n\nThe U.S. does not officially recognize the ICC’s authority, but it is not the first time Washington has looked to halt the court’s actions.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump administration opposed attempts by the ICC to investigate U.S. soldiers and the CIA involved inalleged war crimesbetween 2003-2004 \"in secret detention facilities in Afghanistan,\" and issued sanctions against ICC prosecutors.\n\nPresident Biden's administration undid those sanctions shortly after entering office.\n\nAnders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.
