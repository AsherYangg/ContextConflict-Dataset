        "source_2": "Olympic gold medalistSimone Biles is apologizing toconservative political activistRiley Gaines after a heated social media exchange over transgender athletes' involvement in women's sports.\n\nThe 11-time gymnastic champion's original comments came in response to Gaines, who criticized a Minnesota high school softball team for winning a championship game with a transgender pitcher. The tension between the two athletes escalated online afterthe GOAT called Gaines a \"sore loser\" and \"bully.\".\n\nIn response to the growing backlash and personal tone of her initial post, Biles returned to X on June 10 with a more empathetic message. She directly apologized to Gaines for getting \"personal\" and clarified that her intention was not to advocate for policies that \"undermine fairness in women's sports.\"\n\n“I’ve always believed competitive equity & inclusivity are both essential in sport,” Biles wrote, acknowledging that the current system doesn’t strike the right balance between those principles. While she reaffirmed her commitment to fairness in women’s athletics, Biles emphasized that her issue with Gaines was for \"singling out children for public scrutiny in ways that feel personal and harmful.\"\n\nI wanted to follow up from my last tweets. I’ve always believed competitive equity & inclusivity are both essential in sport. The current system doesn’t adequately balance these important principles, which often leads to frustration and heated exchanges, and it didn’t help for me…\n\nBiles's emphasized the need for compassion in debates that often turn hostile — especially when young athletes are involved — and calls for sports governing bodies to lead with thoughtful policy instead of public shaming.\n\nDespite the friction, Gaines later said she accepted Biles's apology and extended an invitation for more conversation in the future.\n\nGaines is a former All-American swimmer at the University of Kentucky who rose to fame among conservatives in 2022 after she argued against transgender women in sports following a fifth-place tie with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas at a meet.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order in early Februarybanning transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports.\n\nFeeling out of the loop?

You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports.\n\n\"Maybe a transgender category IN ALL sports,\" she continued. \"But instead… You bully them… One things for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!!!!!\"\n\nBiles also claimed Gaines should pick on someone her own size \"which would ironically be a male.\"\n\nThe Olympic gymnast however apologized for the attacks in a lengthy social media post on Tuesday, stating she was pushing for more inclusion in women's sports rather than calling for women to be treated unfairly.\n\n\"I wanted to follow up from my last tweets.
