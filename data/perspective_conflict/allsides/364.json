(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.\n\nThe order, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\n“With thisexecutive order,the war on women’s sports is over,” Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room that included lawmakers and female athletes who have come out in support of a ban, including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order “upholds the promise ofTitle IX”and will require “immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations” that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.\n\nThe timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day, and is the latest in a string of executive actions from the Republican presidentaimed at transgender people.\n\nTrump found during the campaign that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. More than half the voters surveyed byAP VoteCastsaid support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far. He leaned into the rhetoric before the election, pledging to get rid of “transgender insanity,” though his campaign offered little in the way of details.\n\nThe order offers some clarity. For example, it authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, citing noncompliance with Title IX, which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. Any school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding.\n\nEnforcing Trump’s orders will be a priority ofthe embattled department.In a call this week, the acting director of the Office for Civil Rights told staff they would need to align their investigations with Trump’s priorities, according to people who were on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to AP for fear of reprisals.\n\nAlready since Trump took office, the department has openedan inquiryinto Denver public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls’ bathroom, while leaving another one exclusive to boys.\n\n▶ Follow today’slive updates on the Trump administration\n\nTrump also issued a warning to the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president said he had empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make it clear to the IOC that “America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.”\n\nThe IOC has essentially passed the buck on transgender participation, deferring to the international federations for each sport.\n\nThat could change, however, when a new IOC president comes on to replace the retiring Thomas Bach.Former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics, is among the candidates up for election in March. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.\n\nTrump also said that Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will “deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.”\n\nOrganizers for the 2028 Olympics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe order is the latest of a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting transgender people.\n\nPrevious ones have sought to have the federal governmentreject the idea that people can transitionto a gender other than the one assigned at birth. That has implications for areas including passports and prisons. He’s also opened the door tobarring transgender service membersfrom the military; called to end federal health insurance and otherfunding for gender-affirming carefor transgender people under age 19; and restrict the way lessons on gender can betaught in schools.\n\nThe latest order was condemned by trans-rights advocates, including the National Women’s Law Center and GLAAD.\n\n“Contrary to what the president wants you to believe, trans students do not pose threats to sports, schools or this country, and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn, play and grow up in safe environments,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nPushback on some of the administration’s initiatives has already begun in court. Transgender peoplehave suedover several ofthe policiesand more are likely to come. Civil rights lawyers handling the cases have asserted that in some instances, Trump’s orders violate laws adopted by Congress and protections in the Constitution – and that they overstep the authority of the president.\n\nThere could be similar questions for this order, for instance: Can the president demand that the NCAA change its policies?\n\nNCAA President Charlie Baker said its Board of Governors was reviewing the order and “will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration.” Baker, who said last year he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender, noted the order at least provides a uniform policy instead of a patchwork of state laws.\n\nThe order came a day after three former teammates of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas filed a lawsuit accusing the NCAA, Ivy League, Harvard and their own school, Penn, of conspiring to allow Thomas to compete at conference and national championships.\n\nThe lawsuit, which makes similar allegations to those filed last year by Gaines and others, alleges the defendants violated Title IX by allowing Thomas to swim “and acted in bad faith.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville, M.L.

        "source_2": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories of sports.\n\nThe order provides guidance, regulations and legal interpretations, and it will enlist the Department of Education to investigate high schools thought to be non-compliant.\n\nRepublicans say it restores fairness to sports but LGBT advocacy and human rights organisations have described the move as discriminatory.\n\nThe order, which goes into effect immediately, largely covers high school, universities and grassroots sports.\n\nA number of sporting governing bodies, including swimming, athletics and golf, have banned transgender women from competing in the female category at elite level if they have gone through male puberty.\n\nAccording to White House officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday morning, this latest order empowers the Department of Education to investigate how schools implement Title IX, a US law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded education programmes.\n\nAn administration official said that the executive order will reverse the position of the Biden administration which in April last year said that LGBT students would be protected by federal law, although it did not give specific guidance on transgender athletes.\n\n\"If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding,\" Trump explained.\n\nAdditionally, the White House plans to bring in sporting bodies - such as the National Collegiate Athletics Association, or NCAA - to come to the White House to meet female athletes and their parents to discuss concerns.\n\nThe official who discussed the order, said the US would do all it could to prevent transgender athletes from competing against females in International Olympic Committee (IOC) competitions that take place on US soil.\n\nPresident Trump specified that the order would include the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nHe has said he will deny visas for transgender Olympic athletes trying to visit the US to compete at the LA Games.\n\nAhead of signing the executive order, Trump declared that \"the war on women's sports is over\", saying that during the LA Games, \"my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes.\"\n\nHe said he would direct the secretary of homeland security \"to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes...\"\n\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, an IOC spokesperson said that \"working with the respective International Sports Federations, the IOC will continue to explain and discuss the various topics with the relevant authorities\".\n\nWhite House officials described the policies as being broadly popular with Americans, and critical to ensuring \"fairness\" for women in sports, as well as safety.\n\nIn a statement, Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said that the order \"exposes young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don't fit a narrow view of how they're supposed to dress or look\".\n\n\"For so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong,\" Ms Robinson added. \"Not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\"\n\nLess than 1% of the population over the age of 13 in the US are transgender, according to a study by the UCLA Williams Institute, and the number playing sports is smaller.\n\nOn Trump's first day in office on 20 January, he signed a separate order calling for the federal government to officially define sex as either being male or female.\n\nThe former first minister also says she was partly to blame for a loss of \"rationality\" in the gender debate.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.",
        "source_3": "PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order Wednesday that will blocktransgenderathletes from competing in women’s sports.\n\nWith this latest executive order, Trump aims to address his campaign promise to “keep men out of women’ssports” and build on the policy he outlined on his first day in office, calling on the federal government to only recognize two sexes: male and female.\n\nFULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT\n\n“Under the Trump administration, we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls,” the president stated at the signing ceremony Wednesday evening. “From now on, women’s sports will be only for women.”\n\nThe president’s remarks were delivered in the White House’s East Room, with hundreds of girls and young women standing behind them, including former ESPN anchor Sage Steele and former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines.\n\n“The radical Left has waged an all-out campaign to erase the very concept of biological sex and replace it with a militant transgender ideology,” he continued. “We hope they continue onward because I don’t think we could lose a race. This was one of the big reasons that we all won and one of the big reasons that we had a record, a landslide like they haven’t seen before.”\n\nA senior White House official told reporters on a call preceding Trump’s event that the order will “uphold the promise of Title IX and end the dangerous and unfair participation of men in women’s sports.”\n\nThat person called former President Joe Biden’s move to allow transgender athletes to compete against the gender of their choice “a slap in the face to the countless female athletes who dedicate tremendous effort to be the best in their sport.”\n\nWhite House officials argued that the Biden administration misinterpreted theTitle IXrule, which provides equal opportunities for male and female college athletes, “to elevate gender identity as equivalent to sex.”\n\nTrump’s Wednesday order, on the other hand, takes “the exact opposite position” and will require women’s sports to be “equally safe, equally fair, and equally private.” The White House suggested that institutions found to be violating its Title IX interpretation could be in danger of losing out on federal funding.\n\nThe order also calls for investigations intohigh schoolsanduniversitiesthe administration claims are “not providing privacy and dignity for women” by allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports.\n\nTrump’s order will seek to loop in private sector sporting bodies to “come to the White House and listen to the stories of female athletes and their parents.”\n\n“These are stories that maybe people don’t want to cover, maybe people don’t think are important, but these are our nation’s daughters,” one White House official said. “This is happening every day.”\n\nTheWhite Houseclaimed that pursuant to Trump’s order, the administration will “use all of our authority and our ability” to block international transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports on U.S. soil, including not approving visa applications for biological males self-identifying as female.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed later in the day that Trump “does expect the Olympic Committee and the NCAA to no longer allow men to compete in women’s sports,” including at the 2028 Summer Olympic games in Los Angeles."
