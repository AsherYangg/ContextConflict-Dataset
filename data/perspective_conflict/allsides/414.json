Under Biden, the U.S. has committed more than $183 billion to Ukraine.\n\nThe Treasury Department also announced Monday that it would be given Ukraine $3.4 billion in direct budget support for “maintaining the critical government services.”\n\nTrump has promised to wind down the war in Ukraine and negotiate a quick peace settlement.Earlier this month, he met with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where they spoke about bringing the war to a close.\n\n“He wants to make peace,” Trumptoldthe New York Post about his conversation with Zelensky. “That’s new.”\n\n“He wants to have a cease-fire,” he added. “He wants to make peace. We didn’t talk about the details. He thinks it’s time, and Putin should think it’s time because he’s lost — when you lose 700,000 people, it’s time.”\n\nTrump has also been critical of Biden’s recent policy changes, such as allowing Ukraine to launch long-range American-supplied missiles into Russia. He described Biden’s decision as a “very stupid thing” to do.\n\nTrump has maintained that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine had he been president, blaming the Biden administration for the costly war.\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.
