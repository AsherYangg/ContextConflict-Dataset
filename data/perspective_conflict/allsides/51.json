        "source_1": "Republicans on Capitol Hill are calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"come forward and explain\" the Trump administration's handling of Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nIn an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson, the speaker urged Bondi to further clarify her past comment about reviewing Epstein's alleged \"client list.\"\n\n\"Pam Bondi, I don't know when she originally made the statement. I think she was talking about documents, as I understood, that they were on her desk. I don't know that she was specific about a list or whatever, but she needs to come forward and explain that to everybody,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I like Pam. I mean, I think she's done a good job. We need the DOJ focusing on the major priorities,\" Johnson said during the interview.\n\nBondi came under fire over her comments to Fox News in February when asked about Epstein's alleged \"client list.\" She told the outlet at the time, \"It's sitting on my desk right now to review.\"\n\nAfter the Justice Department and FBI last week stated they found no evidence the deceased financier kept a \"client list\" of associates whom he blackmailed or conspired with to victimize dozens of women, Bondi said her comments to Fox News were simply referring to a \"file\" on Epstein.\n\nThat explanation, though, has done little to quelloutrage from MAGA supporterson the administration's handling of Epstein.\n\nJohnson also weighed in on growing calls from Republican lawmakers to have Epstein's convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, testify before Congress.\n\n\"I'm for transparency. We're intellectually consistent in this\" Johnson said when asked about Maxwell potentially testifying before Congress.\n\nJohnson said while he is not \"privy to facts\" and \"this isn't my lane,\" he also said \"we need to put it out there.\"\n\n\"We'll see what happens. I do trust the president. I know his heart and head is in the right place. I don't question that at all. I am convinced they are going to sort this out,\" the speaker said.\n\nTennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett told ABC News he is \"not happy\" with how Bondi has handled the Epstein matter. Like Johnson, he called on Bondi to explain her past comments on the \"client list.\"\n\n\"You know, I know it's the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room, but I'm not happy. Nobody's happy about it. Nobody knows what's going on,\" Burchett said.\n\nLater in a letter sent Tuesday, Burchett called on House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer to invite Maxwell to testify in a public hearing.\n\n\"Should Ms. Maxwell refuse the invitation, I encourage you to use subpoena powers,\" Burchett wrote in the letter, saying the American people have \"questions\" about the Epstein case. \"It is well beyond time those questions are answered,\" he said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said the Epstein files should be made public and directly called for Maxwell to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"I think all this stuff ought to be public. I mean, I think all of the all the documents, should all be public,\" Hawley said. \"I think we'd all ought to be out in the open. I'm a big fan of declassifying-- I think this isn't technically classified. It's just, you know, close hold for prosecution, but I think we ought to put it all out there.\"\n\n\"I think it's reasonable for the American people to ask who he [Epstein] sex trafficked these young women to -- if anybody besides himself,\" added Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy. \"And if there were others involved, why haven't they been prosecuted? That's a perfectly understandable question, and I think the Justice Department is going to have to answer it.\"\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Kentucky GOP Rep. Thomas Massie said he plans to pursue a procedural gambit to trigger a House vote on legislation that would force the release of the \"complete\" Epstein files.\n\nMassie plans to offer a discharge petition, which requires 218 signatures and allows the majority of the chamber to circumvent GOP leaders. There would only be floor action if the resolution receives enough support. A waiting period of seven legislative days kicks off once the petition has enough signatures, so this could become a headache for GOP leaders after August recess.\n\n\"We all deserve to know what's in the Epstein files, who's implicated, and how deep this corruption goes. Americans were promised justice and transparency. We're introducing a discharge petition to force a vote in the US House of Representatives on releasing the COMPLETE files,\" Massie said in a post on X.\n\nGOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, also speaking to the podcaster Benny Johnson in a separate interview, said she would support creating a special counsel to investigate the Epstein matter.\n\n\"There has to be a special investigation into this if we aren't going to be provided information,\" she said.\n\nBoebert also had a suggestion for who should lead the probe.\n\n\"Matt Gaetz as a special counsel? Absolutely,\" she said. Gaetz, a former GOP congressman from Florida, was once the subject of a multiyear federal sex-trafficking investigation. Gaetz had long denied any wrongdoing and the probe ended with no charges against Gaetz.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in the House on Tuesday tried to force a vote and debate on California Rep. Ro Khanna's amendment that would have demanded the release of all the Epstein files. Their effort failed by just one vote after a nearly 45-minute vote.\n\nHouse Judiciary Democrats penned a letter to committee chairman Jim Jordan on Tuesday demanding a hearing with Trump administration officials from the DOJ and FBI on the Epstein files.\n\nJordan, though, publicly expressed unwavering support\n\n\"I have total confidence in President Tump and his team,\" Jordan told ABC News when asked if he had any questions regarding the Epstein case or if Bondi mishandled the situation.",
        "source_2": "Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday that Attorney General Pam Bondi needs to explain her statements regarding Jeffrey Epstein after the Department of Justice announced it would not make any more disclosures in the case of the disgraced financier.\n\nThe statement marks a notable break from President Trump, who has stood by his attorney general and urged his supporters to drop the matter, even as Johnson stressed that he trusts the president.\n\nIn aninterview Tuesdaywith conservative influencer and commentator Benny Johnson, the Speaker was asked about the prospect of Ghislaine Maxwell — Epstein’s one-time girlfriend who was convicted for trafficking young girls — testifying before Congress, or the prospect of subpoenaing documents from the Department of Justice about the matter.\n\n“I’m for transparency,” Speaker Johnson responded. “We’re intellectually consistent in this. Look, [former President] Reagan used tell us, we should trust the American people, and I believe in that principle, and I know President Trump does as well. I trust him. I mean, he put together a team of his choosing, and they’re doing a great job. It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.”\n\n“The White House and the White House team are privy to facts that I don’t know. I mean, this isn’t my lane, I haven’t been involved in that. But I agree with the sentiment that we need to put it out there,” he continued.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican referenced Bondi’s statement from earlier this year in which she saidon Fox Newsthat an Epstein client list was “sitting on my desk right now for review” — a quote that those angry with her subsequent move against disclosure have repeatedly referenced. Bondi has since said she was referring to the Epstein case files more generally, not a specific “client list.”\n\n“She needs to come forward and explain that to everybody,” Johnson said. “I like Pam. I mean, think she’s done a good job. We need the DOJ [Department of Justice] focusing on the major priorities, so let’s get this thing resolved so that they can deal with violent crime and public safety and election integrity and going after ActBlue and the things the president is most concerned about, as we are.”\n\nThe Justice Department and FBI asserted in amemo last weekthat Epstein’s death was a suicide and that he did not have a client list. Officials declined to release any more details, saying information under seal “served only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n\nThat decision enraged many conservatives, who have long viewed the Epstein matter as a case of the rich and powerful covering up horrendous crimes and had hoped Trump would release more information on the case.\n\nWhile the Speaker is usually in lockstep with Trump on major issues, his statement marks an unusual departure from the president’s line.\n\nTrump has urged his supporters to drop the Epstein matter. On Tuesday, he said the Epstein files were “made up” by Democrats, and saidBondi has handled the situation“very well.”\n\nBut the conservative base’s fury has persisted, causing worry — and frustration — among Republicans.\n\n“I’m anxious to get this behind us,” Johnson said, lamenting that “we’re having to spend our time talking about this” after Congress sent Trump’s major tax and spending legislation to his desk. “Let’s get it resolved.”\n\n“What Epstein was involved in was an unspeakable evil. We need to stand against it not just in word, but in deed,” Johnson said.\n\n“I do trust the president. I know his heart and his head is in the right place. I don’t question that at all. And I’m convinced they’re going to sort this out.”",
        "source_3": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) signaled support Tuesday for releasing government files related to dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein – in anapparent break from President Trump.\n\n“I’m for transparency,” Johnson said in an interview with conservative podcast host Benny Johnson, when asked if he would support congressional efforts to subpoena the Justice Department for documents or seek testimony from convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n🚨BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Speaker Mike Johnson says he supports Ghislaine Maxwell testifying to Congress and demands the DOJ release everything they have on Epstein:\"I’m for transparency. We should put everything out there and let the people decide. Pam Bondi needs to come forward…pic.twitter.com/diB5cDQmAk\n\n“It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide,” the House speaker declared.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ announced the conclusion of a “systematic review” of the Epstein case last week, in a controversial unsigned memo.\n\nThe review found “no credible evidence” that Epstein,who died in his Manhattan jail cellon Aug. 10, 2019, “blackmailed prominent individuals” or that investigations against “uncharged third parties” were warranted.\n\nThe memo included a link to surveillance video from the Manhattan prison where Epstein died, suggesting that no one entered the convicted pedophile’s cell the night he committed suicide, and no further disclosures related to the case are planned.\n\nTrump, arguing that the files were “written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration,” has urged his supporters to move on from the case and has backed Attorney General Pam Bondi’s handling of the matter.\n\n“She’s handled it very well. And it’s going to be up to her, whatever she thinks is credible, she should release,” the presidenttold reporterson the White House lawn Tuesday.\n\nHouse Democrats have also pressed the issue, with Rep. Ro Khanna of California adding an amendment Monday to pending legislation on cryptocurrency and national defense that would have required the files to be disclosed to the public.\n\nIn a 7-5 vote, Republicans blocked the measure frompassing the House Rules Committee, preventing it from advancing to a full vote in the lower chamber.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) subsequently announced plans to introduce adischarge petitionin a long-shot bid to force a House vote on Epstein disclosures.\n\n“We all deserve to know what’s in the Epstein files, who’s implicated, and how deep this corruption goes,” the Kentucky Republican wrote on X. “Americans were promised justice and transparency.”\n\n“In 7 days we can start collecting signatures,” Massie said of his petition to bypass House leadership. “At 218 signatures, the House must vote on our bill requiring a full release of the Epstein files.”\n\nSuch procedural gambits are rarely successful in the House.\n\nJohnson, while calling for transparency, noted that he trusts the president.\n\n“Look, [former President Ronald Reagan] used to tell us we should trust the American people, and I believe in that principle. I know President Trump does as well, and I trust him,” the House speaker said. “I mean, he put together a team of his choosing, and they’re doing a great job.”\n\nJohnson acknowledged that “the White House and the White House team are privy to facts that I don’t know” and that he hasn’t “been involved” in the decision over the handling of Epstein documents.\n\n“But I agree with the sentiment that we need to, we need to put it out there,” he said.\n\nJohnson further argued that Bondi, who suggested in a February Fox News interview that a purported Epstein “client list” was sitting on her desk for her to review, should clarify that statement.\n\n“I don’t know, when she originally made the statement, I think she was talking about documents, as I understood that they were on her desk, I don’t know that she was specific about a list or whatever, but she needs to come forward and explain that to everybody,” the House speaker said.\n\nJohnson said he believes Bondi has “done a good job” as attorney general and suggested more transparency related to Epstein would allow the DOJ to start “focusing on the major priorities.”\n\n“So let’s get this thing resolved so that they can deal with violent crime, and public safety, and election integrity, and going after Act Blue, and the things that the president is most concerned about … So, I’m anxious to get this behind us.”"
