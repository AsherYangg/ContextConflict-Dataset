        "source_1": "A Nevada man who recently drove across the country and has a \"documented mental health history\" is accused of walking into aManhattan building with a rifle and opening fire Monday evening, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, police said.\n\nShane Devon Tamura, 27, went into 345 Park Ave. in midtown just after the end of business Monday armed with an M4 rifle andopened fire in the lobbyand again on the 33rd floor before he eventually killed himself, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.\n\n“According to our law enforcement partners in Las Vegas, Mr. Tamura has a documented mental health history,” Tisch said. “His motives are still under investigation.”\n\nOfficer Didarul Islam, 36, who was off-duty working a security job at the building, was one of the four people killed in the attack. The other victims, a man and two women, have not been identified.\n\nTamura has a Las Vegas address, and the BMW he got out of in Manhattan is registered to him in Nevada.\n\nInside the vehicle, investigators found a rifle case with rounds, ammunition magazines and a loaded revolver, Tisch said.\n\nAlso found was medication prescribed to him, Tisch said. She did not say what kind or what it was for.\n\nTamura's vehicle had recently driven across the country, officials said.\n\nIt went through Colorado on Saturday, then Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and was in Columbia, New Jersey, as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday, the day of the shooting — and it entered New York City shortly thereafter, Tisch said.\n\nTisch said security video showed the shooter get out of a double-parked black BMW while carrying an M4 rifle.\n\n“The building security camera footage shows the shooter enter the lobby, turn right and immediately open fire on an NYPD officer,” Tisch said.\n\nThe gunman then shot a woman taking cover behind a pillar and fired at others before he took an elevator to the 33rd floor, where he opened fire again and killed another person, she said.\n\n“We are working to understand why he targeted this particular location,” Tisch said.\n\nTenants of the building include the NFL, Rudin Management, KPMG and Blackstone.\n\nOfficials familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the suspect left a note at the scene voicing anger that his mental illness may be linked to his having played football. Investigators are looking into whether that is a why he targeted the Park Avenue building that houses the NFL offices, the officials said.\n\nThe officials stressed that the investigation is early and ongoing.\n\nIn addition to the weapon and ammo, a cellphone was found at the scene and attempts will be made to get in it to see what it might contain, the officials said.\n\nTwo officials familiar with the matter said that in the note found at the shooting scene, the suspect wonders about “CTE” as being a possible cause of his mental illness.\n\nA man who was wounded in the attack was hospitalized in critical but stable condition Monday night, Tisch said. Four others sustained minor injuries trying to flee, she said.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told NFL employees that a league employee was seriously hurt in what he called \"an unspeakable act of violence.\" The employee was in stable condition at a hospital, Goodell said in a statement.\n\nTamura attended high school in Southern California, where he played football, according to his former teammates, who said they were stunned to learn he was a suspect in the shooting.\n\n“You never would have thought violence was something you’d associate with him,” former classmate Caleb Clarke said. “Everything he said was a joke.”\n\nTamura transferred to Granada Hills Charter School in Granada Hills, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, in 2015 when he was a senior, coming from a school in Santa Clarita, Clarke said.\n\nClarke indicated that the pair lost touch but reconnected through social media recently and that Tamura worked at a Las Vegas casino.\n\nFormer coach Walter Roby said Tamura was a talented running back and “a great player” who was “real elusive, real agile.”\n\n“He came in, worked hard, kept his nose down,” Roby added. “He was a quiet kid, well-mannered, very coachable. Whatever needed to be done, he would do.”\n\nRoby said he was shocked that Tamura was suspected of carrying out a mass shooting.\n\nIn a 2015 Los Angeles Times article, Tamura was mentioned by his high school football coach ahead of his senior year. His coach said Tamura, a running back, was one of the few players he was \"looking for big things from.\"\n\nA former Granada Hills teammate, Anthony Michael Leon, said he and his old football buddies have been texting one another in disbelief since they learned that Tamura was identified as the gunman.\n\n“This is so shocking,” said Leon, 25. “I’m telling you, this was one of those kids who never exerted bad energy or a negative attitude.”\n\nHe said Tamura was in the school’s virtual program, which meant he took classes online and was in school only a couple of times a week outside of the football season.\n\nBut Tamura excelled on the field and led mostly by example, Leon said.\n\n“He was quiet, but when he did actually talk, people listened,” Leon said.\n\nLeon said that he remembered Tamura earning all-conference honors but that Tamura did not appear to harbor ambitions to play in college or the NFL.\n\n“I knew so many kids in high school who made it clear that’s all they wanted to do,” Leon said. “I never got that from Shane.”\n\nRich Schapiro is a reporter with the NBC News national security unit.\n\nErik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.",

        "source_3": "Published:02:22 BST, 29 July 2025|Updated:15:01 BST, 31 July 2025\n\nThe gunman who killed four people and himself inside a New York City office tower on Monday afternoon has been identified as Shane Devon Tamura, a 27-year-old licensed private investigator fromLas Vegaswho once dreamed of a life in football.\n\nAuthorities say Tamura, who had a 'documented mental health history', arrived in Midtown Manhattan by car on Monday afternoon following a mammoth cross-country trip.\n\nNew York mayorEric Adamsindicated that authorities believe his target was the NFL, which has its headquarters in the tower. A note found on the gunman's body mentioned the league.\n\nThe three-page note outlined Tamura's perceived grievances with the NFL over its handling of the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is strongly linked to sports in which players experience repeated head impacts.\n\n'Terry Long football gave me CTE and it caused me to drink a gallon of antifreeze,' Tamura wrote, according to CNN. 'You can’t go against the NFL, they’ll squash you.'\n\nThe shooter was referring to former Pittsburgh Steeler Terry Long, who committed suicide by drinking antifreeze in 2006 after suffering from CTE.\n\n'Study my brain please I’m sorry Tell Rick I’m sorry for everything,' the note read.\n\nTamura was born in Hawaii and grew up in Santa Clarita, California, where he was a high school running back. He later moved to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe man who unleashed chaos inside a Midtown Manhattan office tower on Monday has been identified as Shane Devon Tamura, 27\n\nTamura had once been a promising football player in junior varsity, obsessed with the game and once on a path suggesting a future defined by discipline and teamwork. Pictured in 2015\n\nPhotos posted online showed the gunman wearing a sport coat and button-down shirt while carrying the large rifle near a midtown Manhattan office building\n\nWhen Tamura arrived at 345 Park Avenue in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, he parked his black BMW around the corner before brazenly striding across a wide city plaza with his long-form M4 rifle in plain sight, by his side.\n\nTamura had hisconcealed weapon permit issued by the Las Vegas Sheriff's Department on him as he walked straight into thebuilding's lobby and opened fire.\n\nOnce in the lobby he sprayed it with gunfire, shooting an NYPD officer in the back and a security guard who took cover behind a desk, before heading to the elevator bank and headed up to the 33rd floor and the offices of Rudin Management who run the building and other offices acrossNew York City.\n\nPolice believe was the shooting was premeditated and likely suicidal.\n\n'It appears that he knew it would be his last stand,' saidCNNchief law enforcement analyst John Miller, a former NYPD deputy commissioner.\n\n'He fully intended to shoot his way through the lobby and make his way to that target - whatever that might have been.'\n\nThe building became the scene of a frantic lockdown as gunshots echoed through the corridors and heavily armed police teams swarmed the floors.\n\nWhile the league's offices are housed in the tower, sources confirmed Tamura did not enter the NFL floor.\n\nThe NYPD revealed on Monday night Tamura had traveled throughColoradoon July 26, throughNebraskaon July 27 and through Columbia,New Jerseyas recently as 4pm on Monday before arriving in Manhattan to carry out his deadly rampage.\n\nOfficials say he had no criminal background but his past raises haunting questions.\n\nHe was a promising football player in junior varsity, obsessed with the game and once on a path that suggested a future defined by discipline and teamwork.\n\nIn a video posted online from the 2015 season, Tamura can be heard giving a post-game interview in which he spoke of his victory with the Granada Hills football team based in Southern California.\n\nTamura walked into 345 Park Avenue in the heart of Midtown Manhattan with a concealed weapons permit issued in June 2022 by the Las Vegas Sheriff's Department\n\nThe bloodied rifle used was found lying on the carpet of the office where Tamura ended up killing himself\n\nA New York police investigator exits her vehicle at the scene outside a Manhattan office building where two people were shot including a police officer in New York\n\nShane was instrumental in his teams victory after scoring several touchdowns.\n\n'We were down 10-0, stayed disciplined and came together as a team. Couple of touchdowns,' he said on the day of his interview.\n\nHis old high school friends in California said they were stunned to find out he was the shooter.\n\n'You never would have thought violence was something you'd associate with him,' classmate Caleb Clarke toldNBC.\n\nHis former coach Walter Roby said Tamura was a talented football player and a 'quiet kid'.\n\nBut in the years after he left the field, Tamura's life became murkier.\n\nHe eventually relocated to Las Vegas, where he earned a private investigator's license and obtained a concealed carry permit to carry firearms, both legally granted through Nevada's Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe latter part of Tamura's life is largely invisible to the public.\n\nInvestigators in both Nevada and New York are now urgently combing through his car, phone, and computer in search of answers to try and work out what stressors or perceived injustices led him to carry out Monday's deadly shooting.\n\nDuring a late night press conference NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the police found a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, as well as a backpack and medication prescribed to Tamura.\n\n'Police want to know what brought him to that building, who or what the target was, and what the grievance or motive behind it might have been,' Miller explained.\n\n'These cases often involve people who experience a downfall and begin to blame others - bosses, institutions, society at large.\n\n'Then they decide to get even with everybody, even though in most cases, the problem is usually them,' Miller said.\n\nInvestigators are also poring over Tamura's social media footprint, hoping it might offer clues - manifestos, threats, cryptic posts, or grievances that might have foreshadowed his violent act.\n\nAs of now, police have not said whether Tamura had any personal or professional connection to the building or its tenants, but they are leaving no stone unturned.\n\nAuthorities say there's no immediate evidence of any accomplices, but they are working methodically to verify that no other individual helped plan or facilitate his movements across state lines or into the high-security office tower.\n\nNew York State Police troopers were seen responding to the scene at 365 Park Avenue\n\nThe New York Police Department told the public to avoid the area of East 52 Street between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue\n\nMiller emphasized that shooters like Tamura often spiral quietly, building a world of resentment that no one sees until it erupts in tragedy.\n\n'They blame their problems on other people and entities,' he said. 'Then they decide to get even - with the world, with everyone - even though the problem usually begins and ends with themselves.'\n\nNo motive has yet been officially released, but the scene suggests Tamura had a plan that ended with his own death.\n\nThe shooting caused widespread chaos in Midtown. Workers from nearby finance firms spilled into the streets, hands raised above their heads as NYPD officers locked down the building and initiated a floor-by-floor search.\n\nNearby worker Anna Smith, who had just stepped out to grab dinner, described the moment panic took over. “It was like a crowd panic,” she said. “People just started running. We had no idea what was going on.”\n\nFor roughly two hours, office workers were locked inside surrounding buildings as SWAT teams secured the area.\n\nThe city’s emergency management system issued alerts about road closures, subway disruptions, and traffic delays around Grand Central Terminal and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, both just blocks from the shooting scene.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
