        "source_1": "Kyiv, Ukraine —Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas overnight and damaged a hospital inUkrainefollowing a phone call between Presidents Trump and Vladimir Putin during which the Russian leader refused to back a full30-day ceasefire. Mr. Trumphad said that Putin agreedduring the call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday, however, that Russia's attacks continued to hit his country's civilian and energy infrastructure, despite Putin's purported agreement with Mr. Trump. Zelenskyy said Moscow's refusal to halt all strikes on proved the need for increased pressure on Moscow to prevent Putin from prolonging the war.\n\n\"This confirms that we must continue to pressure Russia for the sake of peace,\" he said Tuesday night. \"Only a real halt to Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure can signal a genuine desire to end this war and bring peace closer.\"\n\nMr. Trump and Zelenskyyspoke by phonefor roughly an hour Wednesday morning, with the U.S. leader describing the call as \"very good.\"\n\n\"Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,\" he said in a statement on Truth Social.\n\nThe White House described the call between Mr. Trump and Putin as the first step in a \"movement to peace\" that it hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting. But there was no indication that Putin has backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.\n\nAccording to the Russian government's readout of the leaders' phone call, Putin reiterated that for a full ceasefire, Moscow would require a complete cutoff of all military and intelligence support for Kyiv from the U.S. and its Western partners. Those terms were not mentioned by the White House on Tuesday.\n\n\"I do not believe that we should make any concessions in terms of assistance for Ukraine, but rather there should be an increase in assistance for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday, reaction to the seemingly unchanged Russian demands.\n\nShortly after Mr. Trump and Putin wrapped up their lengthy phone call, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.\n\nDespite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.\n\nEmergency services said the hospital in Sumy was damaged and that about 150 patients were evacuated, but they did not report any casualties. That drone strike was first reported by top Zelenskyy aide Andriy Yermak, who, ina social media postabout six hours after Mr. Trump's call with Putin ended, said, \"Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure and people right now,\" mentioning specifically the attack on the health facility.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of \"countering our common (Russian-American) efforts\" by attacking Russia's infrastructure. Peskov claimed Russia's military had taken action Tuesday to halt its own planned attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the wake of the Trump-Putin call, including shooting down seven of its own drones.\n\nHe claimed Ukraine had time to do the same, reversing its own drone attack on Russia, but that it had chosen not to.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said earlier Wednesday that its air defenses had intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions — the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.\n\nSeparately, authorities in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which was occupied and then unilaterally annexed by Russia in 2014 and remains under Moscow's control, reported that a drone attack there had started a fire at an oil depot.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The original deal — which Putin declined to back fully — included a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a halt to fighting across the entire frontline.\n\nTrump denied the Kremlin's claim that Putin demanded an end to foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, telling Fox News on Tuesday that the pair \"didn't talk about aid.\"\n\nZelenskyy said after the call that Ukraine is open to any proposals that lead to sustainable and just peace, adding he was seeking more details about what Putin and Trump agreed on.\n\nHe rejected Putin's demand to halt military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said after the call that Moscow was prepared to work with the US for a \"long-term\" solution. Putin added, however, that the way out of the conflict was addressing the \"root causes of the crisis, and legitimate Russian security interests.\"\n\nRussia has previously demanded Ukraine pull back its troops from four regions Moscow claims it annexed, renounce any prospect of joining NATO, and sharply demilitarise — proposals that are at odds with Kyiv's ambitions for peace.\n\nTrump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that discussions between Moscow and Washington would continue, with fresh talks slated to begin in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will lead the US delegation.",
        "source_3": "Russia left a Ukrainian city in total darkness overnight Wednesday after launching drones targeting energy infrastructure and two hospitals — less than two hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin promised President Trump he would halt such attacks.\n\nSome 145 drones hit energy stations and even two hospitals, according to Kyiv — almost immediately after Putin promised Trump he would halt attacks on “energy and infrastructure.”\n\nFurious Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Putin’s “words are very different from reality” while demanding more pressure be put on Russia.\n\nThe overnight attack targeted energy infrastructure in Slovyansk, a city of 100,000 people in the Donetsk region, and the railway power system in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to the Kyiv Post.\n\n“Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure and people — right now,” Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, wrote overnight on Telegram.\n\nPart of the city was left without electricity after the attack, but trains were unaffected. Drones also struck two hospitals in the Sumy region, forcing both patients and hospital staff to evacuate.\n\nA 60-year-old man was injured near Kyiv, which saw dozens of homes damaged or destroyed in the attack.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Russia launched 145 drones, 72 of which were shot down and 56 lost.\n\nThe aggressive move from Russia — immediately after agreeing to a partial cease-fire — drew swift global backlash.\n\nBoris Pistorius, Germany’s defense minister, accused Putin of “playing a game” after Ukraine first reported the strikes on civilians.\n\n“Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the first night after this supposedly pivotal and great phone call have not abated,” Pistorius told German broadcaster ZDF. “Putin is playing a game here and I’m sure that the American president won’t be able to sit and watch for much longer.”\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) also slammed the move, writing on X that Putin “insulted President Trump” by going back on his word.\n\n“Putin’s forces targeted power systems in Slovyansk with guide bombs and attacks continue across Ukraine now,” he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia also accused Ukraine of launching air attacks overnight, with authorities saying an oil terminal was hit in the southern part of the country that caused a fire but no injuries.\n\nThe defense ministry noted its units destroyed 57 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the border Kursk region. It was not immediately clear how many drones Ukraine launched.\n\nThe two-hour phone call, which Trump said was “very good and productive,” ended with an agreement to halt attacks on energy and infrastructure “with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasfire,” Trump said afterward.\n\nNow, after the fallout from the overnight attacks, Zelensky said he plans to speak with Trump on Wednesday to learn more about his call with Putin.\n\n“Today I will have contact with President Trump,” Zelensky said at a news conference in Helsinki. “We will discuss the details of the next steps with him.”"
