        "source_1": "The tax-deferred investment accounts will track the stock market for children born between 2025 and 2029\n\nDonald Trump unveiled a federal program Monday providing $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American babies, getting backing from top business leaders who said they plan to contribute billions more to an initiative tied to “the big beautiful bill”.\n\nAt a White House roundtable with over a dozen CEOs, including from Uber,Goldman Sachsand Dell Technologies, Trump relayed the details of “Trump accounts” – tax-deferred investment accounts tracking stock market performance for children born between 2025 and 2029.\n\n“For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said.\n\nThe accounts will be controlled by guardians and allow additional private contributions up to $5,000 annually. Trump called it “a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation”.\n\nCEOs from major companies including MichaelDell, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs and Vladimir Tenev of Robinhood committed billions for employees’ children’s accounts. Trump praised the executives as “really the greatest business minds we have today” who are “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account”.\n\nMike Johnson, the House speaker, also at the roundtable, championed the program, saying: “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one. Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”\n\nThe program passed the House as part of a massive budget bill but faces stiffer Senate Republican resistance over the broader package. The accounts cannot be implemented as a standalone program and depend entirely on passage of what Trump calls the “one big, beautiful bill” that is “among the most important pieces of legislation in our country’s history”, claiming it’s “fully funded through targeted reforms” including welfare changes and a proposed remittance tax.\n\nHowever, the congressional budget office last week found the bill would alsoadd $2.4tn to the national debtover the next decade while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs. The CBO analysis showed the bill, which passed the House by a single vote and no Democratic support, would leave 10.9 million more Americans without healthcare by 2034.\n\nThe treasury-funded accounts, previously called “Maga accounts” resemble existing 529 college plans but with lower contribution limits – leading some financial advisers to say the Trump accountsmay not offerthe best investment incentives.\n\nThe move is also not without precedent: the UK operated a similarChild Trust Fundwith government seed funding from 2002-2011 before discontinuing the program, while Singapore runs theBaby Bonus Schemethat includes government-matched savings accounts for children.\n\nTrump was optimistic about returns, saying beneficiaries would “really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future”.\n\nJohnson warned that failure to pass the legislation would result in “the largest tax increase in American history” and pushed for swift congressional action on what he called “pro-growth legislation” that would “help every single American”.",

That person will then have access to the full balance beginning at age 25 for qualified purposes, including small business loans and higher education, before gaining full control of the entire balance at 30 for any use. The Trump savings accounts will require post-tax contributions and tax withdrawals aseitherlong-term capital gains or normal federal income, unlike the tax-free qualified disbursements from 529 higher education and Roth IRA retirement accounts.\n\nThe “Trump savings accounts” were previouslyknownas “Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement” or “MAGA Accounts,” a nod to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, before Republican lawmakers in the House renamed them just before passing the bill.\n\n$5,590. That’s how much a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 exchanged traded fund trust ($SPY) made June 9, 2007 – exactly 18 years ago – would be worth today, according to FactSet data, including reinvested dividends. That same investment made 31 years ago would be worth $22,770.\n\nThe Trump savings accounts would cost taxpayers $3.6 billion in its current form of a government-funded $1,000 starting balance, based on the 3.6 million births in 2023, the most recentdatafrom the National Center for Health Statistics. But Trump claimed Monday the government contributions would come at “absolutely no cost” to taxpayers as it would be carved out from “Big Beautiful Bill” initiatives including a 3.5% remittance tax on money sent abroad.\n\nThe Trump savings accounts are “not very attractive” for parents or other custodians to invest in, Alpha Financial Advisors CEO Ann ReilleytoldYahoo Finance, adding it “seems” like the Trump administration is “complicating things for no reason.” Financial experts’ skepticism of the program being the best place for parents to park money for their children beyond the $1,000 freebie stems from its comparatively limited tax benefits compared to 529 college savings and Roth IRA retirement accounts.\n\nThe Trump savings accounts going into law are contingent on the Senate passing the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which became increasinglymurkyas fiscal hawks like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised concerns about projections of a swelling national debt under the package.",

The event was first reported byNBC News.\n\nThe provision would launch a pilot program to create so-called \"Trump Accounts\" for children born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Jan. 1, 2029, which would be seeded with a $1,000 investment from the federal government.
