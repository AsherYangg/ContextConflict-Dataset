But first it must conduct a series of uncrewed tests – the latest of which was expected to happen as soon as this month.\n\nIn advance of that test, SpaceX has conducted a series of tests of the Starship spacecraft as well as the booster engines that are due to carry it to space. The latest was a static fire test, in which the engines are turned on but the spacecraft stays attached to the ground, but it exploded as preparations were being made.\n\nThe explosion came at around 11pm local central time, and was captured on cameras that had been watching the preparation ahead of the test flight.\n\n\"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,\" SpaceX said in a statement on the social platform X.\n\n“Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.”\n\nIt is unclear how much damage the explosion has done to the testing facilities and SpaceX’s facilities near Starbase, its Texas town.\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

The mega rocket’s most recent three test flights, all of which have taken place in 2025, also ended in failures. Theseventh test flighttook place in January, during which SpaceX managed to recover its Super Heavy booster but lost communication with the Starship spacecraft. The companyannouncedat he time that the Starship “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn.” SpaceXlater saidthe most likely cause of the failure was “vibrations” that were “several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing.” The company conducted another test flight in March, but this also ended in failure as the Starship vehicle facedanother “rapid unscheduled disassembly”during its ascent burn. The explosion created a large debris field, which prompted the FAA to issue aground stop orderat several airports in Florida. The ninth test launch also ended in failure as SpaceX lost contact with the spacecraft before it tumbled into Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX’s billionaire founder and CEO, Elon Musk, has not commented on Wednesday’s explosion. However, Musk haddescribed the Starship’s ninth test flightas a “big improvement over last flight” because the spacecraft made it to its “scheduled ship engine cutoff.” He added: “Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.”\n\nAfter the ninth launch, Musk had said the launch cadence for Starship’s next three test flights will be “faster, at approximately 1 every 3 to 4 weeks.” It is unclear if Wednesday’s explosion will impact that planned schedule of launches.\n\nSpaceX Loses Contact With Starship During Ninth Launch(Forbes)",
        "source_3": "Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starship exploded into an enormous fireball on Wednesday night during a routine test for an upcoming launch, as nearby residents recalled their homes shaking from the blast.\n\nThe fiery blowup happened just after 11 p.m. local time as the Starship crew was preparing for the tenth flight test of Ship 36 at the Texas Starbase site near Boca Chica Beach.\n\nOfficials reported a “major anomaly” took place as the reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle was stationed on a test stand.\n\nA live stream of the SpaceX facility captured the moment of the explosion.\n\nIn the footage, the initial fireball appears to come from the top of the rocket before the screen turned white from the dramatic change in lighting ripping through the otherwise dark night sky.\n\nThe gigantic explosion scattered debris around the test site area, as the Starship and test stand were no longer seen in their vertical, upright position.\n\nSpaceX officials confirmed a safety zone had been in place and all staff are accounted for with no reports of any injuries.\n\n“Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials,” the company said on X.\n\nSpaceX reported residents in the nearby communities did not face any hazards due to the explosion.\n\nResidents living near the facility say they felt their explosion from their homes.\n\n“Our whole neighborhood felt it and all the neighbors went outside to see what had happened because it shook all the houses …. my brother-in-law thankfully worked during the day shift,” Brownsville resident Arely Cantutold My San Antonio.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.Subscribe here!\n\nAnother resident, Juan Martinez, said he heard the “huge boom” as he watched the test from a nearby beach.\n\n“Be safe and contact your family members that work there,” Martinezsaid in a Facebook post.\n\nThe fire continued to burn for two hours after the explosion.\n\nWednesday night’s explosion is the latest disaster to plague the private space company’s exploration efforts.\n\nDuring the ninth test flight in May,the Starship blasted off into orbitbut burned up as it fell back into the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe loss followed a series of back-to-back failures of the seventh and eighth Starships.\n\nOn March 6, Starshipsuffered an explosion 10 minutesinto its flight, but its Super Heavy boosters were successfully caught.\n\nOfficials reported several engines stopped working just 20 seconds before the end of its ascent burn in during the test flight.\n\nIn January, a propellant leak during Starship’s ascent caused the rocket to break apart and explode.\n\nDespite the failures, both missions saw success in guiding the Super heavy boosters back to the Texas launchpad, where they were caught with the so-called“chopsticks” or “Mechazilla” mechanical arms.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable, saving SpaceX significantly on cost and resources, which would aid the company in reaching its ultimate goal of pioneering travel to the Moon and Mars.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk has not publicly commented on Wednesday night’s explosion."
