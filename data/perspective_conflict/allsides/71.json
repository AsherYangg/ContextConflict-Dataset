        "source_1": "Elon Musk says he has “formed” his new political party titled the \"America Party.\" The former lead of the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) hadpromised to do just thatif President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” passed. Musk has been—and continues to be—a vocal critic of the policy bill,arguing that it will“cause immense strategic harm” to America on account of the trillions of dollars the bill is projected to add to the debt of the country.\n\n“By a factor of two to one, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste and graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,”Musk saidvia his social media platform, X, on Saturday, a day after Trump signed the bill. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”\n\nThe Tesla CEO had opened apollon July 4, Independence Day, asking his more than 220 million followers if he should create the new political party. Over 65% of the more than 1.2 million respondents voted “yes.”\n\nRead More:Musk Renews Promise to Start New Rival Political Party as Trump Debates Deporting Him\n\nMusk went on to share his potential strategy for “gaining independence from the two-party system,” arguing that he might try to “laser-focus on just two or three Senate seats and eight to 10 House districts” for his party.\n\n“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,”Musk elaborated.\n\nBut as for whatexactlyMusk plans to do with his rival third party is largely open for discussion. Musk has yet to share any specific proposed policies or explicitly state what the core tenets of his party would be.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday,Trump said he was\"saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely off the rails.\" Commenting on Musk's announcement, he said: \"He even wants to start a third political party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States. The system seems not designed for them. The one thing third parties are good for is the creation of complete and total disruption and chaos.\"Here’s what we do—and don’t—know about Musk’s vision for the America Party and how it came to be.\n\nWhen Muskfloated the idea of creating a new political partyin early June amid the very public fracturing of his relationship with Trump, his one-time ally, Musk after conducting a pollsaid: “The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!” He appeared to be referring to those who may not feel seen or represented by either the Republican Party or Democratic Party.\n\nMusk, the country’s biggest Republican donor, is seemingly committed tocampaigning against any Republicanswho showed support and voted for the Big, Beautiful Bill that he so vehemently opposes.\n\n“Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!”Musk said on June 30. “And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”\n\nIf he so desired, Musk could target pivotal congressional seats in an effort to turn them and thus potentially have the upper hand during votes on key matters. He seemingly referenced this plan with his July 4 post about establishing a “laser-focus on just two or three Senate seats and eight to 10 House districts.”\n\nMusk did not elaborate or specify which seats would be at the center of his focus.\n\nWhile Musk has yet to share an actual policy platform for his party, he has reposted and responded affirmatively to some of his X followers’ posts about what the platform could be. What appears to be on the docket is a platform that prioritizes cuts on debt and excess spending within the government, similar to what Musk pushed for during his time in the White House.\n\nOne of Musk’s followers asked: “Is this the America Party platform?” They went on to list the following stances:\n\nIn response, Musk said “yeah!” and went on to repost the list to his millions of followers, but stopped short of providing his own official policy plan.\n\nRead More:Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Faces Opposition From Musk and Some Republicans as Senate Narrowly Votes to Advance It\n\nThough Musk had votedDemocrat previously, he played a vital role for the Republican Party when he became the largest donor of the 2024 presidential race, predominantly funding Trump’s campaign but also financially backing other Republicans via his super political action committee (PAC) titled America PAC.\n\nMusk became a close ally of Trump’s and appeared at major campaign rallies with him, addressing large crowds and urging them to vote for Trump. As a sign of their close working relationship, Trump appointed Musk as the lead of DOGE,a role he held until May. During his tenure, Musk became known for actualizing Trump’s vision of cutting “waste” in the government, which amounted tolaying off thousands of federal employees.\n\nBut Musk and Trump’s relationship soured, especially after the former took a public stance against the spending bill.\n\n“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musktold CBS Newsin May, shortly before he announced his DOGE departure. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”\n\nGoing a step further in early June,Musk saidthe “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination” and told his millions of followers to “call your Senator, call your Congressman… kill the bill!”\n\nMusk and Trump engaged in anall-out war of words,exchanging jabs and lobbying threats—with Trump threatening to take away the government contracts for Musk’s companies, including the SpaceX firm that has become a critical player for NASA. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the falling out stemmed from Musk being unhappy over changes to theElectric Vehicle [EV] mandate.\n\nTensions reignited once more when Musk renewed his calls for the policy bill not to be passed.\n\nWhenasked by reporterson July 1 if he was planning to deport Musk, who has U.S. and South African citizenship, Trump replied: “I don’t know, we’ll have to take a look.”\n\n“We might have to put DOGE on Elon. The monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible?” Trump said, appearing to refer to the contracts and subsidies that Musk’s prominent businesses have from the federal government.\n\nRead More:Musk Floats Idea of Starting New Rival Political Party—and Even Names It—Amid Trump Feud\n\nThough Musk is looking to build a viable, competitive third party, it requires more than an X poll to actualize it in the U.S. In fact, many have tried before.\n\nTwo major parties—Democratic and Republican—have dominated U.S. politics and no third party in recent memory has been able to penetrate the two-party system in a meaningful way.\n\nFormer 2020Democratic presidential primary candidate Andrew Yanghas pushed for representation beyond the two-party system, but has arguably encountered limited success with his Forward Party.\n\nIn June, Yang expressed a keenness to join forces with Musk, seemingly hoping that the two of them may have a stronger chance of succeeding.\n\n“Elon has built world-class companies from nothing more than an idea multiple times, and in this instance, you have the vast majority of Americans who are hungry for a new approach,” Yang said inan interview with Politico. “I’m happy to spell it out for Elon, or anyone else who wants to head down this road. A third party can succeed very quickly.”\n\nPart of the reason third parties struggle is due to the U.S.’ “winner takes all” system in theElectoral College. 48 out of the 50 Statesaward Electoral voteson a winner-takes-all basis (so does the District of Columbia).\n\nThis makes voting for third party candidates difficult. For example, support for theTea Party held strong at 24%according to polls in the 2010s, though they rarely held significant political power, since the Republicans were often fearful of splitting votes in races with narrow margins, which would have risked giving the election to Democratic candidates.",
        "source_2": "Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after dramatically falling out with US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe billionaire announced on his social media platform X that he had set up the America Party, billing it as a challenge to the Republican and Democratic two-party system.\n\nHowever, it is unclear if the party has been formally registered with US election authorities. Musk, who was born outside the US and is ineligible to run for the US presidency, does not say who will lead it.\n\nHe first raised the prospect of forming a party during his public feud with Trump, which saw him leave his role in the administration and engage in a vicious public spat with his former ally.\n\nDuring that row, Musk posted a poll on X asking users if there should be a new political party in the US.\n\nReferencing that poll in his post on Saturday, Musk wrote: \"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"\n\nAs of Saturday, the Federal Electoral Commission had not published documents indicating the party had been formally registered.\n\nWhile there have been high-profile players outside the traditional two-party system in US politics, it is difficult for them to gain strong enough nationwide popularity to pose a real threat.\n\nIn the presidential election last year, candidates from the likes of Libertarian Party, the Green Party and the People's Party alltried in vainto stop Trump or his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, from winning.\n\nMusk was until recently a core supporter of Trump, dancing alongside him during election rallies last year and bringing his four-year-old son to meet Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nHe was also Trump's key financial backer: Musk spent $250m (£187m) to help him regain office.\n\nAfter the election, he was appointed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which was tasked with cutting costs in the federal budget.\n\nHis fallout with Trump began when he left the administration in May and publicly criticised Trump's tax and spending plans.\n\nThe legislation - which Trump has called his \"big, beautiful bill\" - was narrowly passed by Congress and signed into law by the president this week.\n\nThe massive law includes huge spending commitments and tax cuts, and is estimated to add more than $3tn to the US deficit over the next decade.\n\nCrucially for Musk, who owns electric-vehicle giant Tesla, Trump's bill does not focus on green transition or subsidies for products like Teslas.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far,\" Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, this week. \"Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.\"\n\nTrump threatened to have Doge look into subsidies in favour of Musk's companies, alluding also to the billionaire's other businesses.\n\nMusk also owns SpaceX, which launches rockets for the US government, and Starlink, which provides satellite service for US and European defence forces.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",
        "source_3": "President Donald Trump signed the 'big, beautiful bill' in front of Americans at the White House on the Fourth of July.\n\nElon Musk saysthe two-party system is broken, and he just launched a new political party to prove it.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk announced on X, the social media platform he owns, the formation of the \"America Party,\" calling it a direct response to what he described as a corrupt political establishment that no longer represents the American people.\n\nThe announcement followed a viral July 4 poll on X, where Musk asked whether voters wanted independence from what he called the \"two-party (some would say uniparty) system.\"\n\nELON MUSK INDICATES HE'LL DONATE TO REP. THOMAS MASSIE, A REPUBLICAN WHO HAS BEEN EXCORIATED BY TRUMP\n\nOver 1.2 million votes were cast, with 65.4% saying \"yes.\"\n\n\"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it,\" Musk posted Saturday. \"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.

Though Musk did not reference the bill directly in his America Party posts, the timing suggests rising friction between the billionaire and the president. Musk has previously warned that unchecked spending by both parties threatens the long-term health of the economy.\n\nThe new party, according to Musk’s posts, will target a few key seats in Congress. The goal is to create a swing bloc powerful enough to hold the balance of power and block what Musk sees as the worst excesses of both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nELON MUSK SAYS US IS RULED BY 'PORKY PIG PARTY' AS TRUMP DEFENDS HIS VISION AGAINST FORMER ALLY'S CRITICISM\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, center, shows the final tally of the vote on President Donald Trump's One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act during a news conference Thursday at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.(Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome on the right voiced concern in the comments section that a third party could split the conservative vote and help Democrats win more easily.\n\n\"Your third party will disproportionately take votes from the right vs the left and give the left an easier path to power,\" conservative commentator Shawn Farash posted.\n\nOthers, like Joey Mannarino, urged Musk to focus instead on reforming the GOP from within.\n\nCritics also pointed out that the X poll was informal, not limited to American voters and vulnerable to bots.\n\nThird parties havetraditionally had a difficult time gaining ground in American politics as the system is built for two dominant parties. With the Electoral College, winner-take-all elections and strict ballot access laws, outsiders cannot meaningfully compete. Even when a third-party candidate catches fire, it rarely lasts beyond a single election cycle.\n\nElon Musk's America Party announcement comes after President Donald Trump signed his \"big, beautiful bill\" at the White House Friday.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nOne of the biggest third-party efforts in recent history was Ross Perot’s 1992 run.He earned nearly 19% of the popular vote as an independent but didn’t win a single Electoral College vote. It was the closest a third-party candidate got to the White House after President Teddy Roosevelt's famed Bull Moose Party run in 1912 against his onetime protégé, William Howard Taft.\n\nOthers, like Ralph Nader, have tried with the Green Party, and Gary Johnson with the Libertarian Party, butno third-party candidatehas come close to winning the Presidency.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"As the leader of the Republican Party, President Trump has unified and grown the party in a way we’ve never seen,\" White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields wrote in an email to Fox News Digital.\"Having earned the largest share of votes for a Republican presidential nominee and secured majorities in the House and Senate, and with his historic domestic policy agenda swiftly and successfully passed through One Big Beautiful Bill with resounding GOP support, the party is stronger than ever and in lockstep with the Trump agenda.\"\n\nJasmine is a writer at Fox News Digital and a military spouse.
