        "source_1": "Donald Trump'srepeated gaffes, non sequiturs and unusual behavior have opened the door to questions from opponents about the 78-year-old Republican presidential nominee's mental and physical fitness.\n\nFrom bopping to the beat of his music playlist for nearly 40 minutesat a recent swing state town hallto his pro-Vladimir Putin blaming of Ukraine forRussia's invasion, to criticizing former President Abraham Lincoln for not \"settling\" the Civil War, to riffing on locker room gossip abouta pro golfer's anatomy, Trump is providing plenty of fodder for rivals who've declared him \"unhinged\" and worse.\n\nAs Republicans did to 81-year-oldPresident Joe Bidenearlier this year, Democrats includinghorror novelist Stephen Kingand former presidents Bill Clinton andBarack Obamaare seizing every opportunity to bash Trump − and it's a target-rich environment.\n\nTrump's \"health appears to be in question as he demonstrates increasing moments of confusion and disorientation during interviews and rallies,\" saidMichael Cohen, once Trump’s lawyer and now an enemy who has testified against him in legal proceedings.\n\n\"It’s why he is currently obsessing over his medical records and declaring that he is the healthiest person running for the presidency in U.S. history,\" Cohen said.\n\nOther critics say Trump has always been erratic but more people are noticing since Biden left the presidential race in July.\n\nTrump’s allies reply that the former reality TV star simply has a unique style and that any attention paid to his unconventional behavior on the stump is political.\n\nTrump has never been a polished public speaker. From the beginning, his rallies have been long, rambling affairs with regular digressions to jab at rivals or deliver well-worn anecdotes. They have grown longer, and more unfocused.\n\nThat style is authentic and part of his appeal, supporters say. Trump fans regularly applaud that he doesn’t speak like a typical politician.\n\nYet Trump repeatedly has raised eyebrows with his comments and behavior in the closing stretch of his third presidential campaign.His ageand refusal to release detailed health records are adding to the questions.\n\nTrump has released only general statements attesting to his health byU.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, a former White House doctor who ran for Congress with Trump’s support.\n\n\"The fact that the campaign won’t release any medical report tells me that there is data that is unhelpful... unflattering,\" said Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, who served as a cardiologist forformer Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nHarris' White House doctor released a detailedtwo-page medical reporton Oct. 12 that said she \"possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency...\"\n\nPressed to follow suit, Trump's campaign has pointed to athree-paragraph November 2023 letterfrom his physician stating Trump's \"overall health is excellent\" and \"his congnitive exams were exceptional.\"\n\nTrump would be the oldest person ever to win the presidency if he prevails.\n\nHarris and Democrats have leaned into questions about his fitness for office, using the former president’s secrecy about his medical records and recent episodes.\n\n“He’s becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged. The American people are seeing it, witnessing it in real time,\" Harris said on Saturday, hours before Trump rhapsodized about the late professional golfer Arnold Palmer − with strong reference to Palmer's genitalia − at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nTrump told the crowd of men, women and children that when Palmer showered, \"the other men, they came out of there, they said, 'Oh my god. That’s unbelievable.'”\n\nTrump stopped taking questions at a recent town hall in Pennsylvania after a pair of medical emergencies in the crowd, instead dancing and playing music for 39 minutes as supporters trickled out.\n\nBidenseized on Trump's DJ set, telling a crowd in Pennsylvania last week it showed Trump was “unhinged,\" a term repeated by Harris on Saturday.\n\nThe incident offered Biden the chance to return Republican jabs over his age andappearance of infirmity.\n\nNow Trump is by far the older candidate. Harris turns 60 on Sunday.\n\nAfter Trump's brutally comic monologue atthe recent Al Smith dinner, hosted by the Catholic archbishop of New York, former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock said that \"a slurring confused Trump was swearing in front of the priests, doing his mean girls revenge list and showing his brain is circling the drain.”\n\nEven as Trump’s supporters say he has the energy and mental sharpness of a much younger man, there are signs he is showing his age. He has been canceling appearances recently, raising questions about whether he’s fatigued.\n\nPolitico reportedlast week that online news site The Shade Room, while angling for a sit-down with the former president, was told by Trump advisers that he was “exhausted and refusing [some] interviews...\"\n\n“His team is saying that he is suffering from exhaustion, that’s the excuse,” Harris told reporters Friday.\n\n“Being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world,\" she said. \"And so we really do need to ask ourselves: If he’s exhausted from being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?”\n\nHarris' campaign later posted a collection of news headlines about Trump's alleged exhaustion on X and wrote: \"Okay Donald let's get you to bed.\"\n\nIf anything is wrong with Trump − and only his doctor and family would know for sure − he doesn't appear to suffer from a readily identifiable age-related condition, experts say.\n\nTrump has always had an unusual way of speaking, said Jamie Reilly, a cognitive psychologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. \"Can you put a label on it? I don't think so,\" Reilly said.\n\n\"He looks totally different from one day to the next,\" Reilly said, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of diseases often associated with aging like Parkinson's or dementia.\n\nArthur McGovern, a professor of psychology at Nichols College in Massachusetts, said that, while Trump says much that isn't true, his language is as \"authentic\" as that of a politician like Obama, who is much better known for sticking to objective reality.\n\nMcGovern's own analysis of Trump's public performances has turned up nothing to raise concern about his mental state, nor has he seen signs of decline in the former president.\n\n\"He doesn't stand out as a particularly worrisome case to me,\" McGovern said. \"Biden did, unfortunately.\"\n\nClinical psychologist Ben Michaelis has analyzed Trump's speech patterns from before he became a television star into his presidency.\n\nHe said Trump was \"incredibly articulate\" in his 40s and used much more complex sentence structure than when he first ran for president in his 60s.\n\n\"He seemed quite sophisticated in his speech patterns and vocabulary use. He was much more linear back when he was in middle age,\" Michaelis said. \"So there’s definitely been some loss.\"\n\nBut when Michaelis looks at Trump’s language from 2017 to today, he doesn't see much additional change.\n\n\"If he was your grandfather you wouldn’t think twice about it probably. It’s just that he happens to be running for president and the dangers of that are quite obvious to me,\" Michaelis said.\n\nTrump, who's previously called himselfas a \"very stable genius,\"said critics are just playing politics.\n\n“I'm not even tired,\" Trump told reporters Friday in Detroit. \"I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We’re killing her in the polls, because the American people don’t want her.”\n\nTrump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt called the report he is exhausted \"unequivocally false\" and said he is in excellent health.\n\nYet the online politics site The Bulwark, citing anonymous sources who have spoken with and know Trump,reported on Saturdaythat \"the exhaustion is real\" thanks to an aggressive campaign schedule.\n\n“Of course he’s tired,” a Trump adviser told the publication. “Who wouldn’t be tired?\"\n\nJust about every Trump event features mistakes, slurred words, and other idiosyncrasies − most quickly pointed out by opponents.\n\nObamajumped on odd Trump comments last week about in vitro fertilization and theJan. 6, 2021, attackon the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\n\"He called himself 'the father of IVF,'\" Obama said at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. \"I don't know that that means. You do not either. He said January 6 was the day of love... like it was Woodstock.\"\n\nEven some Trump critics don't think much has changed, though.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Illinois Republican congressman, said \"all this talk lately about whether Trump is 'losing it' is missing the bigger issue of whether he ever had 'it' to begin with.\"\n\n\"I don’t see any change in Trump,\" Walsh said, adding he has always been \"nonsensical.\"\n\nTrump mentioned his Republican opponent Nikki Haleywhen he meant Nancy Pelosiduring a speech before the Jan. 23 New Hampshire primary, and regularly invokes Obama’s name when he means Biden.\n\nTrump's rambling style could hurt as he delivers a closing message that often seems scattered.\n\nMarc Short, who served as Trump’s White House director of legislative affairs and later as chief of staff toformer Vice President Mike Pence, said Trump should be laser focused on two issues that favor Republicans – immigration and the economy.\n\nInstead, “it seems he’s still either relitigating past grievances or raising topics that are probably off message.” Short pointed to Trump’s focus onfalse claims about Haitian immigrantsand more personal attacks on Harris.\n\nYet Short doesn’t believe Trump’s age is the root cause, or that his mental acuity is waning.\n\n“I don’t see it,” Short said. “I think he has incredible stamina for somebody 78 years old. I’m not convinced there’s a significant change in demeanor or temperament.”\n\nShort believes the Harris campaign may simply be raising the issue to get Trump to respond and knock him off message, a winning tacticat the Sept. 10 debate.\n\nMany Republicans say jabs at Trump’s mental ability don’t ring true.\n\nSam Nunberg worked on Trump’s first campaign but has become a critic. He hasn't noticed \"any discernable difference” in Trump’s public presentation.\n\nAllies who have spent time with him recently are adamant Trump is mentally strong.\n\n“He is sharp as a tack,” said U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, who attended a recent Pennsylvania rally. \"I’ve never in my life seen someone with an engine and a motor like he has.”\n\n(This story has been updated withchanges to the headlines and to add new information)\n\nWhite House reporter Joey Garrison contributed to this report",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer PresidentDonald Trump's public appearances have grown increasingly disjointed and unfocused, according to a recent observation fromCNNcommentator andThe New York TimesreporterMaggie Haberman.\n\nSpeaking on CNN'sThe Sourceon Tuesday, Haberman said there was a discernible shift in Trump's speaking style, describing it as \"more rambling\" and \"more incoherent\" than in previous years.\n\nHaberman's comments followed Trump's Tuesday interview withBloombergEditor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago, where Trump's answers often wandered far from the original questions.\n\nAt one point, when asked about breaking upAlphabet,Google's parent company, Trump instead responded with an irrelevant reference to aDepartment of Justicelawsuit involving voter roll purges in Virginia.\n\n\"Should Google be broken up?\" Micklethwait said. Trump paused and said, \"I just haven't gotten over something that the Justice Department did yesterday where Virginia cleaned up its voter rolls and got rid of thousands and thousands of bad votes. And the Justice Department sued them, that they should be allowed to put those bad votes and illegal votes back in and let the people vote. So, I haven't gotten– I haven't gotten over that. A lot of people have seen that and I can't believe it.\"\n\nMicklethwait replied, \"But the question is about Google, President Trump,\" to which Trump said, \"Yeah, look. Google's got a lot of power, very bad to me, they are very bad to me. \"\n\nHaberman pointed out that while Trump has always had a \"discursive speaking style,\" it has now \"gotten more rambling.\"\n\nShe said, \"It's gotten longer,\" referencing the length of his speeches, which now frequently stretch beyond 75 minutes compared to shorter addresses while he was in office. Trump's aides, according to Haberman, have reportedly been trying to shorten his speeches, but without much success.\n\nIn a statement toNewsweek, Trump's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung asserted that Trump \"has more energy and more stamina than anyone in politics, and is the smartest leader this country has ever seen.\"\n\n\"He does multiple public events every single day and the public can see he is sharper and more focused than ever before because the future of America is at stake,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"Contrast that with the stupidity and incompetence ofKamala Harristhat is on display and is an embarrassment to the rest of the world. People know President Trump is the strongest and most capable candidate. He has out-worked and out-paced Kamala. TheDemocratsand Kamala are the ones who are diminished because of all the hurt they have caused this country. From skyrocketing inflation, an out-of-control border, and crime decimating American cities, there is only one person who can bring our country back to prominence—President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nDuring the Bloomberg interview, Micklethwait had to repeatedly redirect Trump back to the topic at hand. For instance, while Micklethwait asked about tariffs, Trumpveered into a discussion about the U.S. militaryand its strength. Micklethwait interrupted, saying, \"With great respect, I was asking about tariffs,\" before Trump eventually replied, stating that tariffs help \"tremendously\" because \"China thinks we're a stupid country.\"\n\nThe ex-president's meandering responses during interviews and speeches have reignited debates about the 78-year-old's cognitive sharpness. If elected, he would be the oldest U.S. president in history at the end of his term.\n\nIn September,he was mockedfor his answer to a question about what legislation he would advance to make childcare more affordable.\n\nTrumpresponded: \"I would do that and we're sitting down. I was somebody, we had SenatorMarco Rubioand my daughter Ivanka was so impactful on that issue. It's a very important issue.\n\nSound up!Here's the 2 minute \"childcare is childcare\" rambling and incoherent answer with captions Trump gave for how he's going to make childcare affordable.The audience members at Economic Club of New York that clapped should be ashamed of for enabling Trump's degraded &...https://t.co/0pmsbTIKRLpic.twitter.com/wsk6R1RrBm\n\n\"But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I'm talking about, because child care is child care, you have to have it in this country, you have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers I'm talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they're not used to, but they'll get used to it very quickly.\n\n\"And it's not going to stop them from doing business with us, but they will have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we're talking about including childcare. I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud.\"\n\nA recentNew York Timesanalysis of Trump's speeches found that they have become increasingly harsh, longer, and less focused than during his earlier years in politics. According to the report, Trump's speeches now average 82 minutes, compared to 45 minutes during his 2016 campaign, and include more profanity and extreme rhetoric.\n\nHaberman suggested that Trump's self-described strategy—what he calls \"the weave\"—may simply be an attempt to rationalize his disjointed communication style. \"Calling it 'the weave' is PR to try to explain why he's talking this way,\" Haberman said on CNN.\n\nDuring a Monday town hall event, attendees reportedly began leaving early after Trump decided to stop taking questions from the audience and instead played music andbobbed on stage for 39 minutes.\n\nTrump holds a town hall and instead of answering questions, he stands on stage with boring music playing. Over and over and over again. 🤷‍♀️😳 So cringe and so weird 😬#Trump#TrumpIsALaughingStockpic.twitter.com/Y5nAYgShLk\n\nThe former president attended the town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, moderated by South Dakota GovernorKristi Noem. Proceedings were paused while two attendees received medical attention, at which point Trump jokingly asked whether \"anybody else would like to faint?\" He then said: \"Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?\"\n\nThe songs played included 'An American Trilogy' by Elvis Presley, 'Nothing Compares 2 U' by Sinéad O'Connor, the Village People's 'YMCA' and 'Memory' from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicalCats.\n\nTrump has dismissed concerns about his mental acuity. In a June rally, heboasted of his ability to speak for two hourswithout teleprompters, asserting that his long, unstructured speeches are a deliberate tactic. \"If I say one word slightly out, they say, 'He's cognitively impaired,'\" Trump told supporters, defending his speaking style as \"brilliant.\"\n\nTrump hasrefused to release full up-to-date medical records.\n\nNewsweekhas contacted Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nFlynn Nicholls is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. politics and society.

        "source_3": "No evidence of former president Donald Trump’s alleged “mental decline” showed during Trump’s 90-minute interview with The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board last week.\n\nThe former president’s age, 78, and mental acuity have become targets lately of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and other critics. The WSJ editorial board found no basis for the attacks during a lengthy interview with Trump on Thursday, however.\n\nIn some ways, Trump seemed more knowledgeable and competent during the 90-minute grilling than he did eight years ago during his first run for the White House, according to WSJ.\n\nAccording to WSJ’sreporton the meeting: “Lately Mr. Trump’s detractors have been speculating about his ‘mental decline.’ There’s no sign of such slippage in our Thursday meeting. The 2024 Trump seems more confident and is certainly more knowledgeable about policy than he was in 2015. His discursive style of talking can confuse listeners, but that was equally true nine years ago, and he never appears lost in his thoughts the way President Biden repeatedly did in their June debate.”\n\nHarris, who turned 60 on Sunday, has campaigned on the difference in age between herself and the former president, in addition to other issues. In a recentinterviewon Fox News, Harris said she represents a “new generation of leadership.” Over the weekend, Harris attacked Trump as “increasingly unstable and unhinged.”\n\n“He’s becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged, and it requires that response,” Harris told reporters on Saturday, according toCNN. “I think the American people deserve better than someone who actually seems to be unstable.”\n\nWhile Harris continues to question Trump’s fitness for office, she has avoided criticizing 81-year-old President Joe Biden, who’s mental acuity and health was seized on by Democrats who wanted Biden to end his reelection bid after the June 27 presidential debate. During the debate, Biden appeared muddled and nonsensical at times. BidentrailedTrump in polling amid the pressure to drop from the race.\n\nHarris has maintained that Biden’s mental acuity has not suffered at all during his time as president, and she has continuously defended the president over questions about his health despite the misgivings voiced by Democrats and donors prior to Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.
