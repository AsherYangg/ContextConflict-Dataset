The deal would also allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the remains of their homes in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory on Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu said he had instructed a special task force to prepare to receive the hostages returning from Gaza, and that their families were informed the deal had been reached.\n\nIsrael had delayed a vote Thursday on the ceasefire, blaming a last-minute dispute with Hamas for holding up approval as rising tensions in Netanyahu’s government coalition raised concerns about the implementation of the deal just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete.\n\nNetanyahu’s office had accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas’ new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces inthe Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May.\n\nHamas denied the claims, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, saying the militant group “is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.”\n\nThe ceasefire agreement has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, which the Israeli prime minister depends on to remain in power. On Thursday, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approved the ceasefire. There was no immediate comment from Ben-Gvir following Netanyahu’s announcement Friday.\n\nAP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on last minute issues with an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal.\n\nEgyptianForeign Minister Badr Abdelattycalled on Israel and Hamas to implement a Gaza ceasefire plan “without any delay” in an exclusive interview Thursday with The Associated Press. Egypt has been a key mediator between the enemies for years and a leading player in ongoing ceasefire negotiations.\n\nThedeal announced Wednesdaywould pause the fighting with a view to eventually winding downa 15-month warthat hasdestabilized the Middle Eastand sparkedworldwide protests.\n\nHamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.\n\nIsrael responded with a devastating offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.\n\nThe military campaign has leveledvast swaths of Gaza, and pushed about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are strugglingwith hungerand disease in squalid tent camps on the coast.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister has facedgreat domestic pressureto bring home the hostages, whose families have pleaded with Netanyahu to prioritize the release of their loved ones over politics.\n\nBut Israeli divisions over the deal were on stark display Thursday, as Ben-Gvir threatened to resign, saying the ceasefire was “reckless” and would “destroy all of Israel’s achievements.”\n\nThe departure of Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party would reduce the number of the ruling coalition’s seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, from 68 to 62 — leaving Netanyahu’s government with just the slimmest of majorities. Ben-Gvir said his party would return to the coalition if Israel resumes its war.\n\nBen-Gvir’s resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal. But the move would destabilize the government at a delicate moment and could lead to its collapse if Ben-Gvir were joined by other key Netanyahu allies.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for instance, is vehemently opposed to the agreement and has demanded that Netanyahu promise to resume the war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire as a condition of his party staying in the coalition.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza reported heavy Israeli bombardment Thursday. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires as a way to project strength.\n\n“We were expecting that the (Israeli) occupation would intensify the bombing, like they did every time there were reports of progress in truce talks,” said Mohammed Mahdi, who was sheltering in Gaza City.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the toll of 72 from Thursday’s strikes only included bodies brought to two hospitals in Gaza City and the the number killed was likely higher.\n\n“Yesterday was a bloody day, and today is bloodier,” said Zaher al-Wahedi, a Health Ministry official.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had struck approximately 50 militant targets across the Gaza Strip over the past day, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launch sites.\n\nAnxiety spread across Gaza on Thursday with the news of last-minute quarreling between Hamas and Israeli officials.\n\n“We ask our brothers in Hamas to communicate with mediators to end the war,” said Omar Jendiya, in Deir al-Balah. “Enough with the destruction and killing.”\n\nUnder the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what’s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second — and much more difficult — phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trump’s team took credit for the breakthrough.\n\nLonger-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee thedaunting task of reconstruction.\n\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll in Gaza. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing it of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes.\n\nHamas has come under overwhelming pressure from Israel’s invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and seizure of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders,including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the 2023 attack, have been killed.\n\nBut its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.\n\nShurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.
