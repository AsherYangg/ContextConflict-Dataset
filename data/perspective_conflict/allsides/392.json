        "source_1": "Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, both claimed to be a nonpolitical prosecutor and a Trump loyalist\n\nPam Bondi,Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, offered limited assurances on Wednesday that she would maintain the justice department’s traditional independence from the White House at her confirmation hearing before the Senate judiciary committee.\n\nThe consensus across the committee was that Bondi, the former Florida attorney general and longtime state prosecutor, was sufficiently qualified and experienced to lead the department in Trump’s second term.\n\nBut she walked a fine line between casting herself as a nonpolitical prosecutor and as a Trump loyalist, which was viewed with alarm by Democrats concerned that she will find it challenging to resist political pressure exerted by the president.\n\nBondi insisted that she would ensure the justice department would remain independent by continuing the policy that restricts the interactions with the White House and would not allow the FBI to pursue Trump’s perceived enemies, as identified by FBI director nomineeKash Patel.\n\n“I will meet with the White House counsel and appropriate officials and follow the contacts policy,” Bondi said, adding later that there would “never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice”.\n\nAt the same time, Bondi expressly avoided saying that Trump lost the 2020 election, delivering the boilerplate response that Joe Biden became the president. And she dodged trickier hypotheticals like what she would do if Trump asked her to use the justice department for his own ends.\n\n“I wouldn’t be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out,” Bondi said, when asked if she would resign if Trump asked her to do something illegal.\n\nPressed on her own remarks on TV about her interest in “prosecuting the prosecutors” – comments widely seen as being aimed at the prosecutors who indicted Trump – Bondi pivoted to complain about a prosecutor who had doctored an application for a warrant during theRussia investigation.\n\nThe hearing was unlikely to allay concerns held by Democrats that she would be able to resist political interference by Trump given her personal loyalty to him, including when she supported Trump’s 2020 election fraud claims and joined his legal defense team at his first impeachment trial.\n\nThat loyalty to Trump has also raised hackles at the justice department, which prides itself on its independence from White House pressure and recalls with a deep fear how Trump in his first term ousted top officials when they stopped acquiescing to his demands.\n\nTrump replaced his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after he recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia and, later, soured on his last attorney general, William Barr, after he refused to endorse Trump’s false 2020 election claims.\n\nBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency. From our opinion desk.\n\nBondi also faced questions from Democrats about possible conflicts of interest arising from her most recent work for the major corporate lobbying firm Ballard Partners, especially on behalf of government contractors like the Geo Group, a Bureau of Prisons contractor accused of mismanagement.\n\nAs the chair of Ballard’s corporate regulatory compliance practice, Bondi has also lobbied for major companies that have battled the justice department she will be tasked with leading, including in various antitrust and fraud lawsuits.\n\nIf she were presented with an instance of possible conflict of interest, “I will consult with the career ethics officials within the Department of Justice and make the appropriate decision”, Bondi said. She declined to say upfront whether she would recuse herself.\n\nBondi graduated in 1987 from the University of Florida and earned her law degree in 1990 from Stetson University. She was a county prosecutor in Florida before successfully running for Florida attorney general in 2010 in part due to regular appearances on Fox News.\n\nDuring Bondi’s tenure as Florida attorney general, in 2013 her office received nearly two-dozen complaints about Trump University and her aides have said she once considered joining a multi-state lawsuit brought on behalf of students who claimed they had been cheated.\n\nAs she was weighing the lawsuit, Bondi’s political action committee received a $25,000 contribution from a non-profit funded by Trump. While Trump and Bondi both deny a quid pro quo, Bondi never joined the lawsuit and Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine for violating tax laws to make the donation.",
        "source_2": "Sen. Marco Rubio used his confirmation hearing Wednesday to warn a Senate panel that China might move against Taiwan before the decade is over and that a potential ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine must provide the Ukrainians with sufficient leverage to deter a repeat invasion in the future.\n\nRubio, R-Fla., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to become secretary of State, testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he is expected to receive bipartisan support in a vote scheduled for Monday. He is one of the few Trump Cabinet choices expected to have broad bipartisan support on the floor, with a vote possible as early as Inauguration Day.\n\nAs such, much of the attention around Rubio’s confirmation hearing has focused on how he would apply Trump’s “America First” foreign policy, with its blend of isolationist and aggressive tactics, to some of the world’s hot spots.\n\n“Every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?” said Rubio, still the second-ranking Republican on the panel and the top-ranking GOP member on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn his 14 years in the Senate, Rubio has become well-known for his internationalist views. Those include supporting an active global U.S. military presence and a powerful intelligence community but also pushing for a rethinking of how key U.S. economic sectors including banking, pharmaceuticals, advanced technologies and supply chain management should be regulated to limit China’s ability to exploit them to further its own geopolitical and security goals.\n\nRubio said the post-Cold War assumption in Washington among many Democrats and Republicans “that all the nations of Earth would become members of the democratic Western-led community and that a foreign policy that served the national interest could now be replaced by one that served the liberal world order” has been revealed to be a “dangerous delusion.”\n\nHe said an end to the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces needs to be brought about though he didn’t offer specifics for how the second Trump administration would do so. He said, however, that a successful ceasefire couldn’t happen if one side holds leverage and the other doesn’t.\n\nTrump and members of his inner circle, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, R-Ohio, have made many comments that worry many Ukraine supporters that the U.S. might pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire on terms favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nZelenskyy has said long-term security guarantees for Ukraine are essential in any ceasefire negotiations and has dropped his previous insistence that Kyiv would never agree to cede land that Russian military forces have occupied.\n\nZelenskyy has demanded that Ukraine be allowed to join NATO to discourage future Russian predation. But amid resistance among some members of the Western military bloc to admitting Ukraine, some experts have suggested the U.S. and other alliance members could pledge to maintain a rotating troop presence in the Eastern European country, acting as a deterrent against future Russian invasions.\n\nRubio indicated he shared the view that Ukraine must have some sort of security guarantee in any ceasefire agreement. “Russia wants to impose neutrality on Ukraine and retrofit and come back and do this again in four, five years,” he said.\n\nOn Taiwan, Rubio backed a policy that would make the cost of invading Taiwan higher than any benefits for Beijing. He also said it’s clear from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings that absorbing the democratic island is personally very important to Xi.\n\n“What they are basically saying is that this is a foundational and definitional issue for Xi Jinping personally,” Rubio said. “Unless something dramatic changes [in Beijing’s cost calculation] we’re going to have to deal with this before the end of the decade.”\n\nMany committee Democrats spoke warmly and appreciatively to Rubio, indicating he will be confirmed with significant bipartisan backing. Both Democrats and Republicans complimented Rubio on the breadth and depth of his knowledge on foreign policy issues. He answered a range of questions relating to Chinese-Philippine tensions, the United Nations, Panama, Haiti, Cuba, Sudan, Israel and Hamas, Hong Kong, the Australia-United Kingdom-United States security partnership and more.\n\n“The president made a great decision in choosing you. You’re a thought leader in foreign policy,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.",
        "source_3": "CIA Director-designate John Ratcliffevowed in his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday that he would excise “political or personal biases” and make the spy agency “the ultimate meritocracy” — while refocusing its energy onChina as the “top national security threat” to the US.\n\nRatcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence in the first Donald Trump administration, announced before the Senate Intelligence Committee he would return the Company to its “core mission” of collecting foreign intelligence on America’s adversaries in a strictly “apolitical” manner.\n\n“To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,” he said. “If it doesn’t, then it’s time to find a new line of work.”\n\n“It has been said that theCIA’s World War II predecessor — the OSS— described its ideal recruit as ‘a Ph.D. who could win a bar fight,'” he added. “This sentiment is the essence of what today’s CIA must recapture. But we must find that fighting spirit in recruits whose talents, skill sets, and backgrounds are more varied than ever.”\n\nA recent audit of the agency found “a significant percentage of the current CIA workforce does have concerns about the objectivity of the products that they’re producing,” Ratcliffe noted, adding that some of those products end up in the President’s Daily Brief of intelligence analysis.\n\nIt’s an issue that the former Texas Republican congressman also saw firsthand and called out during the FBI’s Trump-Russia collusion probe — and denounced as DNI when 51 ex-spy officials declared Hunter Biden’s laptop was “somehow a Russian intelligence operation.”\n\n“I stood alone and told the American people the truth,” he said, indirectly slammingex-CIA director Leon Panetta, who was one of the former officials signing an open letter alleging the laptop was “Russian disinformation.”\n\nAsked by Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) whether he would “ever change or remove content in an intelligence assessment for political reasons or at the behest of political leadership,” the CIA pick said, “No.”\n\nRatcliffe also declared that “the world’s premier intelligence agency” under his leadership would “steal secrets” from adversarial nations — contradicting remarks from former spy chief John Brennan — and especially “increase” its “focus on the threats posed by China and its ruling Chinese Communist Party.”\n\n“As DNI, I dramatically increased the Intelligence Community’s resources devoted to China,” he recalled. “I openly warned the American people that from my unique vantage point as the official who saw more intelligence than anyone else, I assessed that China was far and away our top national security threat.”\n\nIn an interview broadcast Sunday night on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray called China the “defining threat of our generation.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on the intelligence panel expressed no major reservations about Ratcliffe’s candidacy, likely putting him on a glide path to full Senate confirmation — potentially as soon as Jan. 20, one source close to the process told The Post.\n\nSome Democrats, however, expressed concerns about potential “loyalty tests” being imposed to oust civil servants, to which the expected spy boss said he “will” prohibit them.\n\nRatcliffe added his expected term would come amid “the most challenging national security environment in our nation’s history,” adding that it included the southern border, which has seen hundreds of migrantswith terror tiescrossing it in recent years.\n\nSeveral lawmakers agreed with his assessment, while citing glaring failures by the US Intelligence Community (IC) in response to crises.\n\n“There was some misjudgment of how long the Afghan government would stand after the United States’ hasty and ill-advised withdrawal,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). “The IC missed early assessments on Ukraine’s willingness to fight, projecting incorrectly how quickly the Russians would be able to take Kyiv.\n\n“They did not warn or predict of the Hamas mass attack against Israel. The IC was surprised at South Korea’s martial law declaration,” she went on. “Nor did they predict the rapid collapse of the Syrian regime.”\n\nAsked how he would avoid the same pitfalls, Ratcliffe responded: “If you have a politically motivated, bureaucratically imposed social justice agenda that takes a part of your attention, that can distract from the core mission of collecting human intelligence that matters and providing it to you in a timely way.”\n\nElsewhere, Ratcliffe also discussed his views on declassification of intelligence while maintaining the “trust” of US allies, the controversial spy power known as FISA Section 702, anomalous health incidents like Havana syndrome — and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he had constituents who were “threatened on Election Day by an ISIS terrorist in Oklahoma Citythat was discovered initially by a 702″ query.\n\n“That 702 authority is important,” Lankford emphasized of the authority that lets intelligence agencies like the FBI sweep up text messages, emails and other communications from foreign targets without a warrant\n\n“FISA, and particularly Section 702, is an indispensable national security tool,” Ratcliffe affirmed while clarifying that it has been “abused” — such as during the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane probe into the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nIt makes up “sometimes more than half of the actionable foreign intelligence that we provide to the president,” the Texan noted.\n\nCritics of Section 702, whoused to count DNI pick Tulsi Gabbardamong their number, maintain that the authority violates US citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining without a warrant any of their communications traded with foreign nationals outside the country.\n\n“What you can’t have is accessing that or making a query for political reasons or for some reason other than protecting our national security,” Ratcliffe added, saying “safeguards” would prevent that and noting that “the critics haven’t provided any alternative.”\n\nOn COVID, the CIA chief-in-waiting committed to better communication for preventing the next pandemic — but did not discuss how FBI and Defense Department scientists were purportedly “silenced” for trying to put forward evidence that the virus leaked out of a Chinese lab in Wuhan.\n\n“We never really got resolution on that, which is a concern for me,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), thoughmultiple congressional investigationscompiled evidence thatheavily favored a lab-leak origin.\n\nRatcliffe, who previously testified to Congress that the lab-leak theory was the “only” explanation for the pandemic, did say that Americans should “in some cases, demand” to know the causes of COVID, which he said may have killed as many as 25 million people worldwide.\n\nIn his opening statement, Ratcliffe thanked current CIA Director William Burns for “a smooth and professional transition.”\n\nBurnstold NPRin an outgoing interview earlier this month that the agency “formed a new China mission center,” the first of its kind for an adversarial nation and one comprising roughly 20% of the CIA’s total budget.\n\n“This is one of those moments of, I think, revolutionary change on the international landscape, with intense major power competition with China and with Russia,” Burns said, “but also a revolution in technology, unlike anything we’ve seen since the Industrial Revolution.”"
