        "source_1": "SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas sent troops toRussia, the U.S. said Wednesday, its first public confirmation of a move that has rattled Western allies and could mark a major escalation of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“There is evidence of DPRK troops in Russia,” Defense SecretaryLloyd Austintold reporters in Rome, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\n\"What exactly they're doing is left to be seen,\" Austin said, adding, \"We're trying to gain better fidelity on it.\" It's a \"serious issue,\" he said, if North Korea's \"intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf.\"\n\nSouth Koreaand Ukraine have sounded the alarm in recent days, sharing intelligence and voicing dissatisfaction with what they see as a lack of urgency in the response from the U.S. and other Western countries.\n\nThe reclusive natures of the Kremlin andKim Jong Un’s regime mean that observers have pored over social media video and satellite images in search of confirmation that Russia is deploying the troops to Ukraine in what would be a dramatic new step in the burgeoning alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers said Wednesday that North Korea had sent 3,000 troops to Russia out of a promised 10,000 to be deployed by December. That is twice the 1,500 the South Korean intelligence agency had reported being sent last week.\n\nUkrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid Tuesday that two units of North Korean troops, with as many as 6,000 people each, were being trained for deployment.\n\n“This is a challenge, but we know how to respond to this challenge. It is important that partners do not hide from this challenge, as well,” he said in his nightly video address.\n\nLt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence,told the U.S. publication The War Zonethat North Korean troops could arrive as early as Wednesday in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion in August.\n\nSouth Korea summoned the Russian ambassador Monday to demand the withdrawal of the North Korean soldiers and “related cooperation.” South Korea, a U.S. treaty ally that has so far provided only nonlethal aid to Ukraine, now says it is considering providing defensive weapons and even offensive ones in response.\n\nState Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday that the deployment would “mark a dangerous and highly concerning development” and that the U.S. was consulting with its allies and partners “on the implications of such a dramatic move.”\n\nAustin had not mentioned the reports during hisMonday visit to Kyiv, where he met with Zelenskyy and announced $400 million in new military aid.\n\nThe U.S. and other countries say Pyongyang is already supplying Moscow with badly needed munitions, including millions of artillery shells, in exchange for key military technology that could strengthen Kim’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Russia and North Korea deny any transfer of arms.\n\nIn addition to boosting Russia on the battlefield, the involvement of North Korean troops would solidify the growing ties between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin, whosigned a pact in Junethat includes a pledge of mutual defense.\n\n“The Russians are going to appreciate some of the backfilling and assistance,” said Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer and senior lecturer in war studies at England’s University of Portsmouth.\n\n“It will help them in securing and reinforcing their lines of supply for artillery mainly because North Korea is an artillery power,” he told NBC News.\n\nLedwidge and others say it could also provide the large but little-tested North Korean military with critical combat experience and real-time information about the performance of its weapons systems as Kimramps up his war rhetoricagainst Washington and Seoul.\n\nThe reports of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia have also revived discussion about whether countries in Europe should send their own troops to support Ukraine.\n\n“Everyone flips out whenever they talk about European troops going to Ukraine, that it’s far too escalatory. And then the Russians just go ahead and bring in outside troops,” said Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThe South Korean intelligence service said last week that North Korea had sent about 1,500 special forces soldiers for training in neighboring Russia on vessels from Russia’s Pacific Fleet. Upon arrival, the agency said, they received Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, as well as fake identification documents to make it look as if they come from Russia’s Far East, where people can resemble North Koreans.\n\nThe agency told NBC News on Wednesday that it had used artificial intelligence facial-recognition technology to confirm that a North Korean soldier seen in a photo taken in Ukraine is Ri Song Jin, who also appeared with Kim last year in photos of a visit to a North Korean weapons factory.\n\nThe agency said the photo showed Ri sitting with a Russian soldier at the launch site for a North Korean missile in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.\n\nThe North Korean missile technicians deployed to front-line areas in Ukraine “are there to provide support in using the North Korean missiles, to find out technical problems and also to secure additional technologies,” the agency said.\n\nThe agency also released satellite images from last week of a training ground in Russia’s Far East that it said showed hundreds of North Korean soldiers gathering at military facilities.\n\nNorth Korea’s envoy to the United Nations dismissed the accusations as “groundless rumors” Monday. The Kremlin says its cooperation with North Korea is not directed against anyone else.\n\nSpokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not directly answer questions about whether North Korean troops were fighting for Russia, saying there was “conflicting information.”\n\n“South Korea says one thing, then the Pentagon says they have no confirmation of such statements,” he told reporters Monday, before Austin’s comments.\n\nOthers have also questioned the reports of North Koreans in Ukraine, with Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, warning that Russia could be using them for propaganda purposes.\n\n“There are no North Korean soldiers, yet,” his office said.\n\nNorth Korea has the world’s fourth-largest military, with around 1.2 million military personnel, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank. The deployment in Ukraine, if confirmed, would be the North Korean military’s first direct involvement in a conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nStill, their addition would be “incremental,” Ledwidge said, with a few thousand troops unlikely to make much difference at all, let alone win the war for Russia.\n\nIt’s more of a political statement to signal the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, he said, and it would provide a training ground for inexperienced North Korean soldiers, adding to Seoul’s worries.\n\n“North Korea gets to bring back home some combat experience,” he said.\n\nThe language barrier between Korean-speaking and Russian-speaking soldiers would be another obstacle.\n\n“They’re not going to break up the Koreans and stuff them into Russian units,” O’Brien said. “It would be a disaster.”\n\n“What we’ll see is Korean units acting together as Korean formations. The Korean ones will be in liaison with the Russians, and they will get their orders back and forth,” he said.\n\nThe first troops could likely be a “trial run,” he said. “And if it works, well, my guess is they’ll be back.”\n\nStella Kim reported from Seoul and Mithil Aggarwal from New Delhi.\n\nMithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.",

        "source_3": "Secretary of DefenseLloyd Austinconfirmed Wednesday that the United States has seen “evidence” thatNorth Koreantroops have deployed toRussia.\n\nAustin is the first U.S. official to confirm reports from Ukrainian and South Korean leaders about the North Korean troop movements.\n\n“We are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops that have gone to Russia,” hetoldreporters traveling with him Wednesday in Rome. “What, exactly, they’re doing is left to be seen.”\n\nAustin did not specify how many troops the U.S. believed had traveled to Russia and whether any had been deployed to Ukraine. There have been differing reports thatanywhere from 1,500to 12,000 soldiers have been dispatched. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskytold a NATO Summit last week that North Korea could be providing Russia with “10,000” soldiers and technical personnel.\n\n“If they’re a cobelligerent, their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf. That is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well,” Austin added.\n\nIt’s unclear what North Korea will get in exchange for providing troops to Russia.\n\nPentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder has not confirmed whether the U.S. has seen intelligence indicating North Korean troops had deployed to Russia on Tuesday afternoon but said if it were to happen, it would “mark a dangerous and highly concerning development.”\n\n“Clearly, North Korea and Russia have a relationship,” he added. “As to the eaches [sic] of that relationship and the kinds of exchanges of information and training that they’ve had over the years, you know, that — that in and of itself is not something that’s necessarily new. But obviously, we’re continuing to keep a close eye on this as it relates to the situation in Ukraine.”\n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly warned against adversaries coming to Russia’s aid for its war in Ukraine, but Moscow has been able to strengthen its relationships with Tehran, Beijing, and Pyongyang.\n\nIran has provided Russia with hundreds of kamikaze drones, sent it ballistic missiles, and has helped it set up its own factory to build more of these drones, while North Korea has provided it with artillery and now troops.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNorth Korea’s decision to provide troops to Ukraine comes only weeks before the U.S. presidential election, where continued U.S. aid to Ukraine is effectively on the ballot.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has indicated she’s in lockstep with President Joe Biden’s continued aid to Ukraine, while former President Donald Trump described Biden last month as “the greatest salesman on Earth” due to continued U.S. support for Ukraine."
