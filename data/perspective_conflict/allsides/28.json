        "source_1": "American Eagle’s “great jeans” advertising campaign with actor Sydney Sweeney is at the center of the latest political firestorm online, drawing accusations of racial undertones in its messaging.\n\nSweeney, who rose to fame for her starring roles in HBO’s “Euphoria” and “The White Lotus,” is the star of the clothing retailer’s latest denim-focused fall campaign, with the tagline, “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.”\n\nIt’s a play on words for Sweeney’s “great genes.”Indeed, in one clip, which accrued more than 1.1 million views on American Eagle’s Instagram page, Sweeney stands before a poster of herself titled, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes,” before the word “genes” is crossed out and replaced with “jeans.”\n\nThe nod toward her \"genes\" is also made inanother video, which further incited backlash from some users on platforms like TikTok, X and Threads who accused American Eagle of promotingeugenics, “white supremacy” and “Nazi propaganda.”\n\n“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,” Sweeney says, before the camera pans up to her blue eyes. “My jeans are blue.”\n\nA representative for Sweeney declined to comment. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs of Monday morning, neither Sweeney nor American Eagle had addressed the backlash publicly.\n\nThe campaign is for American Eagle’s new fall collection, featuring a limited-edition denim jacket and “The Sydney Jean,” created in collaboration with Sweeney. The jeans display a butterfly motif representing domestic violence awareness, and all revenue from its sales will be donated to the Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit offering free 24/7 mental health support, according to the campaign.\n\n“Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy — paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously — is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign,” American Eaglewrote on its website last week.\n\nThe discourse has also drawn retaliatory backlash from others online who say the criticisms of the ad campaignare an exaggeration. Some are embracing the political undertone of the ad byhailing itas an end to overly “woke” marketing campaigns.\n\nIt’s the latest controversy to highlight a growing cultural rift over perceived “wokeness” as conservative-leaning culture swings back into the mainstream. In recent years, those on the online right have often praised media that unapologetically upholds traditional white American beauty standards, especially when it doesn’t come with any attempt to be inclusive.\n\nThese shifting ideals have been marked by an upswing in trends like the\"old money\" aesthetic, theend of the body positivity movementand therise of the tradwife lifestylein popular culture.\n\nWhen American Eagle announced the collaboration with Sweeney last week, the company’sstock briefly soared.\n\nBut after sharing more than a dozen social media posts featuring Sweeney over the past few days, the brand’s latest post on Sundaystarred a different model.\n\n“Denim on denim on denim… on denim,” American Eagle wrote in the Instagram caption. “AE has great jeans👖✨”\n\nMany commenters, who noticed that this model appeared to be nonwhite, were quick to call the new post “damage control.”\n\nAngela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSydney Sweeneyhas come under fire for her appearance in a controversial new ad campaign with denim brand American Eagle.\n\nTheEuphoriastar fronts the label's fall denim collection under the tagline: \"Sydney SweeneyHas Great Jeans.\" The pun has drawn widespread backlash on social media and reignited conversations about racism, eugenics, and the historical exploitation of women in advertising.\n\nThe ad features Sweeney, 27, speaking directly to the camera. \"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color … my genes are blue,\" she says, while seductively buttoning up a pair of jeans.\n\nThe wordplay between \"jeans\" and \"genes\" is presented as a clever twist—but critics argue it is far more insidious.Newsweekreached out to Sydney Sweeney's publicist and the American Eagle press office for comment via email.\n\nAdvertising expert Robin Landa, a professor at Michael Graves College at Kean University, toldNewsweek: \"The campaign's pun isn't just tone-deaf—it's historically loaded.\"\n\nLanda said that the phrase \"good genes\" was once central to American eugenics ideology, which promoted white genetic superiority and enabled the forced sterilization of marginalized groups.\n\nLanda added that, when major brands use language with such weight, they risk reinforcing harmful ideologies under the guise of clever messaging.\n\nLanda said that careless wordplay in advertising can help normalize exclusionary beliefs with consequences that extend far beyond product sales.\n\nWhile the campaign ignited outrage across Threads andTikTok, American Eagle's stock has reportedly surged by 4 percent since the ad's release on Wednesday, suggesting a commercial win—even amid cultural controversy.\n\nReactions on social media were divided. Threads user @goodlifebreeze wrote: \"I think the play on 'GREAT JEANS' and 'GREAT GENES' was brilliantly placed. Throwing Sydney in there was good since she's that chick right now. BUT, here's where I step to the side—American History is ugly asf [as f***] … so ugly and deep that Black ppl [people] + and the ppl who 'knows what's up' pick on the micro-aggressions, see the invisible ink, hear the heavy heartbeats + smell the scent of PREJUDICE + RACISM.\"\n\nAnother user, @ephem3ra, said they initially thought the ad was simply sexualizing Sweeney to sell jeans, but changed their mind and noticed the racialized undertones after seeing the full version: \"But THIS one? Yeah, I see it.\"\n\nWriter andTikTok user E.B. Johnsonalso weighed in, garnering over 100,000 views for their take. In a widely shared video, Johnson noted that the ad seemed to echo a specific line from vintage Calvin Klein commercials: \"The secret of life lies hidden in the genetic code.\"\n\nFor me, I question any woman who willingly engages in “head nods” to nympette and coquette culture.\n\nThese ads starred actress Brooke Shields, beginning when she was just 14, and became infamous for their sexualization of a minor. Johnson expressed concern over the homage, questioning why adult women today—like Sweeney—are still willing to recreate or reference advertising that originally caused such harm.\n\nJohnson said: \"We really have to question ourselves. Why are these women so willing to engage in media and culture that promotes moments like this … for the bag?\"\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed. \"This Sydney Sweeney outrage is so stupid. Dear liberal white women, stop making us look bad. It's not a dog whistle. It's just marketing. It's not any different from the soap with her bath water in it,\" said Threads user @ashbart90.\n\nThere has been increased attention to Sweeney's growing association with conservative-leaning symbols in pop culture.\n\nIn a recentNewsweekarticle, the actress was linked to the viral\"Hot Conservative Girl\"trend, joining others such as internet personality Haliey Welch in being embraced as a kind ofRepublicancultural icon.\n\nThat growing alignment, combined with the subtext of the American Eagle campaign, has only fueled further scrutiny of Sweeney's public image.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nLydia Patrick is a Newsweek Life and Trends Reporter based in London, focusing on emerging trends, human interest stories, and women's issues.

        "source_3": "Leftist TikTok is in full pitchfork-and-torch mode after anew ad for American Eagle jeansfeaturing actress Sydney Sweeney used a play on words, with some claiming it’s full-on Nazi propaganda.\n\nThe ad features Sweeney, 27, clad in a pair of the brand’s jeans and a denim jacket, talking about her jeans/genes.\n\n“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color,” she intones in a spot.\n\n“My jeans are blue,” she says as she flashes her blue eyes.\n\nThe clip went viral after it was posted by a Sweeney fan account — but then the account later went private following the backlash on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not here to tell you to buy American Eagle jeans. And I definitely won’t say they’re the most comfortable jeans I’ve ever worn, or that they make your butt look amazing. Why would I need to do that?” she says in the 30-second spot.\n\n“But if you said that you want to buy the jeans, I’m not gonna stop you. But so we’re clear, this is not me telling you to buy American Eagle jeans,” she says as the text “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” appears on the screen and a male voiceover reads the words.\n\nThis play on the homophone of “jeans” and “genes” was enough to trigger the woke mob, with many on the left interpreting it as a nod to eugenics, with some going so far as to outright call it “Nazi propaganda.”\n\n“I thought it was gonna be, like, kinda bad, but wow. That’s gonna be in history books!” one TikTok user posted.\n\n“I will be the friend that’s too woke, but those Sydney Sweeney American Eagle ads are weird. Like, fascist weird. Like Nazi propaganda weird,” another user with a septum piercing mused.\n\n“Like, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman is talking about her good genes. That is Nazi Propaganda,” she added.\n\nAnother TikTokkermade a videobemoaning the ad, saying, “If you haven’t seen or comprehended how bad it is, I need you to open your f–king eyeballs and listen. This is Nazi s–t. Pure Nazi s–t,” she brayed.\n\n“Saying that a blonde-hair, blue-eyed girl has ‘good genes’ is Nazi s–t.”\n\nJournalist Robby Soavecalled the manufactured outrage“quite possibly the stupidest, most-likely-to-backfire liberal overreach social media pile-on in the history of the internet.”\n\nThe jeans ad isn’t the first time the blonde bombshell drew fire from the left as a tool of some nefarious pro-white plot.\n\nLast year, after hercleavage-bearing appearance on “Saturday Night Live,”outlets like Slate spilled ink decrying a small handful ofright-leaning publications, cheekily declaring the publicly accepted ogling of an attractive white lady as a sign of the “death of wokeness.“\n\nThe lefty outletwrotethat the starlet’s ascent “is very good news for a certain population of people who were waiting for a movie star exactly like her — someone white, blonde and all-American who, unlike Taylor Swift, hasn’t yet provided the right with a reason to see her as a threat.”\n\nAmerican Eagle has described the Sweeney campaign as “a return to essential denim dressing,” and are using the high-profile endeavor to benefit charity.\n\nThe brand has enlisted the A-lister to launch “The Sydney Jean” — a limited-run pair of jeans featuring a butterfly on the back pocket, representing domestic violence awareness — an issue Sweeney herself is passionate about, the company says.\n\nTo benefit the cause, 100% of the purchase price of the “Sydney Jeans” will be donated to Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit offering free, 24/7 confidential mental health support.\n\nWall Street has been enthusiastic about the flirty new ad campaign, American Eagle’s stock hassurged nearly 17%in the five days since its debut."
