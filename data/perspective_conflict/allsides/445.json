        "source_1": "The ceasefire went into effect 4 a.m. Wednesday, local time.\n\nIsrael's Cabinet has approved the U.S.-backedceasefire proposalbetween Israel and Hezbollah on Tuesday after prolonged negotiations.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the Cabinet for approval on Tuesday evening, local time. The deal was approved 10-1, with only far-right minister Ben Gvir voting against the plan.\n\nThe deal then went into effect at 4 a.m. Wednesday, local time, as intended.\n\nIt went into effect five hours after the agreement was announced by Israel. Shortly after Israel shared the news, there was an announcement at the White House by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Lebanese army and security forces will deploy in southern Lebanon over the next 60 days and take control of the territory controlled by Hezbollah, Biden said. At the same time, Israel will withdraw its forces over the next 60 days in order for civilians to return to their homes on both sides of the border.\n\nHowever, with the deal not going into effect until morning, bombing continued in Beirut even as Biden wrapped up his comments.\n\n\"Israel appreciates the U.S. contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security,\" the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.\n\nNetanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah has not yet officially commented on the ceasefire.\n\n\"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"We will enforce the agreement and respond forcefully to any violation. We will continue together until victory.\"\n\nBiden echoed those thoughts in his comments, saying, \"Let me be clear, if Hezbollah, or anyone else, breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense, consistent with international law, just like any country when facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.\"\n\nThe prime minister hailed \"great achievements\" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.\n\n\"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action,\" Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. \"If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. If it tries to renew terrorist infrastructure near the border -- we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack.\"\n\nThe deal does not affect the ongoing war in Gaza being fought by Israel against Hamas. However, Biden said the U.S. will continue to work to find a peace in Gaza.\n\n\"Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza,\" Biden said. \"They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement. People of Gaza have been through hell, their worlds absolutely shattered.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Far too many civilians in Gaza have suffered far too much, and Hamas has refused for months and months to negotiate a good-faith ceasefire, and a hostage deal. And so now, Hamas has a choice to make their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens, which they hold.\"\n\nNetanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.\n\nThis was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.\n\nNetanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.\n\nIn October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.\n\nTensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.",
        "source_2": "A ceasefire deal to end 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has taken effect.\n\nThe US and France said the agreement would “cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organisations operating from Lebanon”.\n\nHezbollah has been given 60 days to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon while Israeli forces must withdraw from the area over the same period.\n\nThis is what we know about the ceasefire from the agreement itself and official briefings.\n\nUS President Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday night that it was \"designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities”.\n\nThe 13-point agreement between the governments of Israel and Lebanon- and not Hezbollah - also says both countries are “prepared to take steps to promote conditions for a permanent and comprehensive solution”.\n\nIt states that the Lebanese government will \"prevent Hezbollah and all other armed groups in the territory of Lebanon from carrying out any operations against Israel\".\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, will \"not carry out any offensive military operations against Lebanese targets, including civilian, military, or other state targets, in the territory of Lebanon”.\n\nThe basis of the deal, it notes, is the \"full implementation, without violation\" of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last war in 2006.\n\nThe resolution required, among other things, Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the area between the Blue Line - the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north.\n\nIsrael said that was never implemented, allowing Hezbollah to build extensive infrastructure in the area, while Lebanon said Israel’s violations included military flights over its territory.\n\nThe agreement also notes that the resolution reaffirmed previous Security Council calls for the \"disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon\".\n\nBiden declared that “Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon will not be allowed to be rebuilt”.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement says Israeli forces will move south of the Blue Line “in a phased manner” within 60 days. The Lebanese army’s troops will deploy “in parallel” to the positions.\n\nA senior US official said this was \"to prevent any vacuums from being formed\".\n\nWithout mentioning Hezbollah, the agreement says the Lebanese army will “dismantle all infrastructure, and military positions, and confiscate all unauthorised arms\" in what it calls the Southern Litani Area, as well as stop the unauthorised entry of weapons into Lebanon and dismantle any unauthorised weapons production facilities.\n\nThe agreement also says that “Lebanon’s official military and security forces, infrastructure and weaponry will be the only armed groups, arms, and related material deployed” in the Southern Litani Area. The only exception is the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, Unifil, which has about 10,000 troops.\n\nThe US official said that meant Hezbollah would have to pull back its fighters and “all their heavy weaponry” to the north of the area.\n\nA map of the Southern Litani Area shows that it extends north of the river in some locations, notably around the village of Yohmor, and extends to Hasbaya and Chebaa in the east.\n\nA total of 10,000 Lebanese army troops will eventually be deployed to the south, according to the agreement.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the troops’ role in enforcing the ceasefire, and whether they would confront Hezbollah if needed, which would have the potential to exacerbate tensions in a country where sectarian divisions run deep.\n\nThe Lebanese army has also said it does not have the resources - money, manpower and equipment - to fulfil its obligations, although the agreement says the US and France will work with the international community to provide support and improve its capabilities.\n\nMany Western officials say Hezbollah has been weakened and that this is the moment for the Lebanese government to re-establish control over all the country's territory.\n\nThe US and France will join the existing Tripartite Mechanism involving Unifil, the Israeli military and Lebanese army that was set up to help reach agreements on contentious issues.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement says the US will chair the “reformulated and enhanced” mechanism, which will “monitor, verify and assist in ensuring enforcement” of both sides' commitments.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon will be expected to report any alleged violations to the mechanism.\n\n“What this means is that the United States, both through diplomats and military personnel, is going to be receiving any complaints by either side,” the senior US official said. “Information can flow on a real time basis to make sure that any potential violations are deterred.”\n\nThe official also stressed that “there will be no US combat troops in the area”.\n\nThe agreement states that “these commitments do not preclude either Israel or Lebanon from exercising their inherent right of self-defence, consistent with international law”.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said on Tuesday night that Israel would “maintain full freedom of military action” in Lebanon “with the United States' full understanding”.\n\n“If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terrorist infrastructure near the border, we will attack. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck carrying rockets, we will attack,” he asserted.\n\nBiden supported that view, telling reporters: \"If Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defence consistent with international law.\"\n\nBut Lebanese officials said they would oppose any violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty.\n\nIsrael says it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, accusing him of leading a Hamas cell, which he had denied. Israel provided little evidence for the claim.\n\nIsrael said it targeted well known reporter Anas al-Sharif and alleged he was part of Hamas, which Al Jazeera has denied.\n\nIn the shadow of the Gaza war, violence is rising in the occupied territories as radical settlers seize land with the backing of the government.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\".\n\nProtesters call for the release of hostages still being held in Gaza as they voice support for Israel.",
        "source_3": "WASHINGTON — President Biden spoke from the Rose Garden Tuesday to tout a cease-fire plan between Israel and Hezbollah — claiming credit for helping broker the agreement after months of fighting.\n\n“I just spoke with the prime ministers of Israel and Lebanon. I’m pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,” Biden, 82, said.\n\nBiden said that “this is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.”\n\n“What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed,” Biden said of the Iran-backed terrorist group based in Lebanon.\n\n“What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed — and I emphasize, will not be allowed — to threaten the security of Israel again,” Biden said of the Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist group.\n\n“Over the next 60 days, the Lebanese army and state security forces will deploy and take control of their own territory,” he went on.\n\n“Once again, Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon will not be allowed to be rebuilt and over the next 60 days, Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces and civilians.”\n\nThe plan calls for the Islamist group to “roughly north of” southern Lebanon’s Litani River to put them far from the Israeli border, a US official said.\n\nIsraeli troops on Tuesday reached the river, which the Jewish state has long sought as the northern extent of a desired protective buffer.\n\nBiden said that “civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities and begin to rebuild their homes, their schools, their farms, their businesses and their very lives.”\n\nThe deal, approved by Israel’s cabinet after significant involvement by France’s government, comes as Biden has failed to broker a cease-fire deal between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group in the Gaza Strip.\n\n“Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza,” the outgoing president added in the Rose Garden.\n\n“Now Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release hostages, including American citizens, which they hold and in the process bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian relief.”The Israeli military in the past two month killed the leaders of both Hamas and Hezbollah — with longtime Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah killed in a Sept. 27 airstrike in Beirut just 10 days after a covert Israeli operation killed and wounded hundreds of the group’s operatives by detonating the pagers they used to communicate.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told reporters on a press call that he had briefed members of President-elect Donald Trump’s team on the developments and “they seem to be supportive.\n\n“Hezbollah is extremely weak at this moment, both militarily and politically, and this is the opportunity for Lebanon to reestablish its sovereignty over its territory,” that official said."
