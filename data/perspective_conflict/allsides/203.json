        "source_1": "US-born progressive streamer says officials at Chicago airport led him to private room on return from France\n\nHasan Piker, a US-born progressive political commentator, said he was stopped by US Customs and Border Protection agents and questioned about his opinions of Donald Trump and Israeli war policy as he returned to the country on Sunday from France.\n\nPiker, recounting the incident on his Twitchlive streamon Monday, said he was led to a private room at Chicago O’Hare airport and interviewed for nearly two hours about his political views.\n\n“The goal here is to put fear into people’s hearts, to have a chilling effect on speech that, like, the government is unafraid of intimidating you,” Piker said. “Does this stop me from saying whatever the fuck I want to say? Of course not. Don’t be ridiculous. But the reason why I wanted to talk about it was to give you more insight into what the government is doing, and to speak out against this sort of stuff.”\n\nThe leftwing streamer has built a mass following on YouTube and Twitch around his blend of political, cultural and social commentary. Piker, born in New Jersey, was carrying a US passport when he re-entered the US on Sunday, after a trip to France with his family to celebrate Mother’s Day.\n\n“I think they did it because they know who the fuck I am, and they wanted to put the fear of God into me,” Piker said.\n\n“This is nothing but lying for likes,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas.”\n\nShe added: “Upon entering the country, this individual was referred for further inspection – a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler. Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released.”\n\nA CBP official called the suggestion that Piker was targeted for his political views “baseless”.\n\nPiker repeatedly described the exchange as “cordial” but said he was transparent with the officer interviewing him that he planned to speak out about his experience, which the streamer said felt anything but random and “routine”.\n\nAssuming the officer was familiar with his online commentary, Piker said he was candid about his views, telling the agent he was “not fond” of the US president.\n\nHe said the officer was particularly focused on his criticism of Israel’s prosecution of the Gaza war, asking him: “Do you like Hamas? Like, do you support Hamas? Do you think Hamas is a resistance group?”\n\nIn response, Piker said he told the officer that he was a “pacifist” and wanted “the endless bloodshed to end”.\n\n“I just kept repeating that over and over again,” he said, describing the line of questioning as “insane” and a violation of his first amendment rights.\n\nPiker said this was his first attempt to return to the US using the global entry program, which normally expedites travel. He was returning to the US to speak on Monday at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.\n\nPiker said neither his phone nor laptop were searched. He said the interview ended shortly after he asked whether he was being detained or if he was free to go. The officer told him he had not been detained, but Piker described it as a de facto detention.\n\nChip Gibbons, the policy director ofDefending Rights & Dissent, said in a statement: “We are deeply disturbed that CBP is stopping political commentators at the border to interrogate them about first amendment-protected activities. Such an abuse of power is an affront to press freedom.”\n\nAlex Peter, an attorney and popular online creator who shares content about the American judicial system,wrote: “DHS flagging and detaining one of the US’s largest leftwing voices for their political opinions while the Trump admin suggests they might suspend habeas corpus does not portend well for the future.”",

        "source_3": "Champagne socialist streamer Hasan Piker claims US immigration officials were trying to “detain him permanently” when they allegedly stopped him for questioning after he flew from France to Chicago over the weekend.\n\n“They straight up tried to get something out of me that I think they could use to basically detain me permanently,” Piker recounted in a 40-minute livestream, saying agents were peppering him with questions about his feelings about Hamas.\n\n“I kept repeating the same statement over and over again. I kept saying … ‘I’m on the side of civilians. I want the endless bloodshed to end. I am a pacifist. I want wars to end,’ ” he said.\n\nDuring the stream, Piker, who has cheered both Hamas and Houthi terrorists on his platforms and repeatedly called Israelis “inbred,” portrayed himself as bravely stonewalling the agents’ questions.\n\nThe far-left streamer, 33, who boasts more than 2.8 million followers on the livestreaming platform Twitch, is known for espousing repugnant viewpoints, including that it “doesn’t matter if rapes happened on Oct. 7,” referring to the Hamas terror attack against Israel that killed more than 1,200 people.\n\nPiker claimed US Customs and Border Protection detained him as part of a campaign to “create an environment of fear” and an attempt to silence voices of dissent.\n\n“Nothing I have done online is illegal as of now,” he said. “Laws may change in the future, and they might actually start prosecuting speech, which I do fear is the goal of this administration. But so far, everything I’ve done is fully protected under the first amendment.\n\n“I think they [detained me] because they know who the f–k I am, and they wanted to put the fear of God into me, not knowing that I’m a stubborn piece of s–t and that’s not going to work at all,” he boasted in his best tough-guy voice.\n\nThe self-described socialist drives a $200,000 Porsche, makes millions of dollars a year spewing invective — like his infamous claim that America “deserved” the 9/11 attacks — and lives in a multimillion-dollar home in West Hollywood.\n\nLast month, the New York Times wrote alaughably glowing profileof Piker in which the Gray Lady swooned over his love of “bro”-coded activities like lifting weights and unironically describing him as “very handsome.”\n\nDuring the two hours Piker said he was detained, he claimed he was worried CBP agents would confiscate his phone or laptop, though neither item was seized.\n\nHis detailed self-aggrandizing recap of the alleged encounter follows a rash of clout-chasing influencers and wannabes posting exaggerated accounts of similar brushes with immigration officials on social media.\n\nOver the weekend, an anti-Trump TikTokker who goes by the name “eyesofsav” posted a video claiming she was detained for “hours” as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pored over her phone and social media accounts.\n\nDHS replied to her posting, calling the allegations “false” and detailing the incident in full.\n\n“Claims that her political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas,” theDHS response reads in part.\n\n“Upon entering the country, this individual was referred for further inspection — a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler. Once her inspection was complete, she was promptly released.”"
