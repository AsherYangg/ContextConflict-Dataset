        "source_1": "President-elect Donald Trump and the head of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, will announce a $100 billion investment effort designed to spur artificial intelligence and related infrastructure projects.\n\nThe effort,first reported by CNBC, will seek to create 100,000 jobs over four years.\n\nTrump and Son announced a similar initiative in 2016 after Trump was elected president for the first time, with SoftBankagreeing to invest $50 billion in the U.S.with the aim to create 50,000 jobs. It is not clear whether that effort fully paid off, as many of SoftBank's numerous startup investments in the U.S. and beyond failed to pay off. A report from Forbes in 2019 found hard data on the ultimate impact difficult to come by. Axios, however, reported it largely met the marks, at least for a time.\n\nToday, SoftBank is a much smaller company than when Trump first took office nearly a decade ago — and according to Bloomberg News, it has only $25 billion in cash on hand, raising questions about how Son and his firm will come up with the pledge money.\n\nA SoftBank representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSon joins the slew of tech titans announcing investments following Trump's electoral victory. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this month each announced $1 million contributions to Trump's inaugural fund, as have OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the AI startup Perplexity.\n\nRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.",
        "source_2": "SoftBank Group announced a multibillion-dollar investment into U.S. projects during President-elect Donald Trump’s second time in office, likely in AI jobs—doubling a similar promise SoftBank’s CEO made in Trump’s first term that createdmixed results.\n\nSoftBank’s billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son and Trump jointly announced the initiative Monday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, matching earlier mediareports.\n\nTokyo-based SoftBank will dedicate $100 billion to U.S. ventures over the next four years—double a similar commitmentannouncedin December 2016 heading into Trump’s first presidential term.\n\n“President Trump is a double down president, I’m going to have to double down,” Sonsaidat the joint press conference.\n\nThe upcoming investment aims to bring an estimated 100,000 jobs in AI and related industries supporting the burgeoning technology, according to Son.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes found Son’s $50 billion pledgewas largely fulfilled, though the jobs promise was difficult to track, and questionable, after the near-collapse of SoftBank-funded WeWork.\n\n“He’s a great negotiator,” Sonjokedabout Trump after the American asked Son to double his commitment to $200 billion.\n\nExactly what SoftBank’s massive investment will entail. SoftBank, which is perhaps best known for itsVision Fundventure capital arm, is a major player in AI, with a majority stake in generative AI chip architect Arm Holdings and a$1.5 billionstake in OpenAI, maker of the viral ChatGPT chatbot. SoftBank has $30 billion of cash in hand, the Journal noted, meaning it’s also not fully known how the Japanese company will raise the full extent of the commitment.\n\nSon is the second-richest person in Japan and the 56th-richest person in the world with a$32 billionfortune, according to our estimates.\n\nTrumpdescribedSon as “one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time” on Monday. Son, whobelievesAI will be 10,000 times smarter than humans by 2035, is a part of a growing chorus of the ultra-rich seemingly bullish on the prospects of American industry under Trump. In addition to the world’s richest man Elon Musk’s significant backing of Trump, tech titans like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all have expressedoptimismabout the U.S. tech industry’s prospects during Trump’s upcoming term and donatedmillions to his inauguration.",
        "source_3": "SoftBank Group, the Japanese investment powerhouse led by CEO Masayoshi Son, announced plans on Monday to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years, a move that underscores renewed optimism about the American economy as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House.\n\nThe announcement, made at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, highlighted the Japanese company’s focus on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, data centers, and chip manufacturing. SoftBank estimates the investment will create 100,000 jobs in the United States by 2029.\n\nPresident-elect Trump celebrated the pledge as a major endorsement of his economic vision. “This is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America’s future,” Trump said, flanked by Son and Howard Lutnick, the president-elect’s nominee for commerce secretary. Son, in turn, praised Trump’s leadership and pledged to help position the U.S. as a leader in the global AI revolution.\n\n“I am truly excited to make this happen,” Son said. “President Trump’s victory has energized the business world, and we are proud to support his vision for growth and innovation.”\n\nDuring the event, Trump pressed Son to think even bigger, asking whether the company might double its investment to $200 billion. Son responded with a smile, saying, “I will try to make it happen.” Trump immediately seized on the statement, proclaiming, “Alright, 200,” to applause from the crowd. “He’s a great negotiator,” Son joked, underscoring the friendly rapport between the two leaders.\n\nWhile specifics of the expanded investment remain unclear, SoftBank’s $100 billion pledge builds on its history of transformative U.S. investments. In 2016, Son committed $50 billion to U.S. startups following Trump’s first election victory, a promise that Trump credited to his influence. This latest pledge doubles down on that earlier commitment and signals a shift toward investments in critical infrastructure for the rapidly evolving AI sector.\n\nSoftBank’s announcement comes at a pivotal moment for the U.S. economy, as the country seeks to cement its leadership in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Son, a longtime advocate for AI’s potential,has described the current era as a “gold rush of intelligence”and predicted that machines with human-level cognitive abilities—known as artificial general intelligence—could emerge within the next few years.\n\nSoftBank’s planned investments are expected to encompass not only AI research but also supporting sectors such as data centers, chip manufacturing, and healthcare technology. Earlier this year, the company announced a joint venture with U.S.-based Tempus AI to advance healthcare innovations.\n\nTrump, who has vowed to expedite federal permitting for large-scale investments, has made attracting international capital a cornerstone of his economic strategy. “Any company that invests $1 billion or more in the U.S. will receive fully expedited approvals and permits,” Trump wrote last week on his Truth Social platform, adding that the policy would help drive economic growth and create jobs.\n\nThe collaboration between Trump and Son is not new. In December 2016, just before Trump’s first term, the two met in New York, where Son pledged his initial $50 billion investment. The move was widely seen as a testament to Trump’s ability to court international business leaders and spur economic activity.\n\nSoftBank’s track record in the U.S. includes stakes in major companies such as Nvidia and Alibaba and a focus on ventures pushing the boundaries of technology. While some of its past investments—like its backing of WeWork—have faced challenges, the company remains one of the most influential players in global tech.\n\nTrump and Son’s partnership also highlights the broader economic ties between the U.S. and Japan. Son, a University of California, Berkeley graduate, has often emphasized his admiration for American innovation. With Trump preparing to take office in January, the renewed collaboration signals a strong start for his administration’s efforts to attract foreign investment and foster economic growth.\n\nThe $100 billion commitment represents a significant vote of confidence in Trump’s ability to deliver on his campaign promise of economic renewal. As the U.S. looks to maintain its competitive edge in AI and technology, SoftBank’s investment marks a powerful statement of support for the future of American innovation"
