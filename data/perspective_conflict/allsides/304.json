Israel’s deadliest bombardment of the territory in the 17-month war killed mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nNetanyahu said the attack was “only the beginning” and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.\n\nA woman reacts over the body of a person killed during overnight Israeli army airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)\n\nHamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday’s strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas’ civilian government, a justice ministry official and two security agency chiefs.\n\nAll further ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire,” he said in a statement aired on national television. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel’s actions.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warnsupplies are running outtwo weeks after Israelcut off all food, medicine, fueland other goods to Gaza’s 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIn this image made from a video released by the Israeli Government Press Office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement Tuesday, March 18, 2025, in Tel Aviv, Israel.

In Gaza City, Omar Greygaa said that after the strikes, he ran out to help survivors in a nearby stricken building.\n\n“In every room I found the dead. ... I finish in one place and go to another, and I find more dead,” he said. “I don’t know if we’re in a state of war or truce.”\n\nThe attack could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians andcaused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of theroughly two dozen hostages held by Hamaswho are believed to still be alive.\n\nA senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.\n\nProtesters demand the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\n\nThere were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.\n\nBut Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel’s southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country’s territory, the military said. The U.S. over the weekend launched deadly strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis.\n\nIsrael’s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahufaces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. His latest testimony ina long-running corruption trialwas canceled after the strikes.\n\nThe strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.\n\nThe main group representingfamilies of the hostagesaccused the government of “deliberately dismantling” the ceasefire. Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square Tuesday evening to protest Netanyahu’s intention to fire the country’s domestic security chief and demand the government to resume negotiations for a hostage deal.\n\n“Today Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the hostages.\n\nAn injured man waits for treatment on the floor of a hospital following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Mohammad Jahjouh)\n\nAfter two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.\n\n“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”\n\nA hit on a home in Rafah killed17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.\n\nBy noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.\n\nAt Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.\n\nShe said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don’t know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry’s records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian casualties, saying it operates among the population.\n\nInjured Palestinians wait for treatment at the hospital following Israeli army airstrikes in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Mohammad Jahjouh)\n\nThe war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.\n\nThe war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.\n\nThe White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”\n\nThe ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.\n\nAn Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas’ military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.\n\nThe official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forcesquickly returned to the streetsin recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.\n\nPalestinians inspect the damage at Al-Tabi’in School in central Gaza Strip following an Israeli airstrike, Tuesday, March 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)\n\nUnder the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.\n\nBut Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives.\n\nInstead, Israel demanded Hamas releasehalf of the remaining hostagesin return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.\n\nIsrael says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals thatcould be incompatible.\n\nA full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza.\n\nIt would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakerswho want to depopulate Gazaand rebuild Jewish settlements there.\n\nProtesters demand the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Tuesday, March 18, 2025.

In his role, al-Da'alis was responsible for the functioning of Hamas' terror regime in the Gaza Strip and oversaw the integration of all of Hamas’ branches in Gaza and their use for terrorist purposes,\" the statement said.The IDF and ISA also determined with \"high probability\" that Israeli strikes eliminated Mahmoud Marzouk Ahmed Abu-Watfa, the Minister of Internal Affairs in charge of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; Bahajat Hassan Mohammed Abu-Sultan, who served as Head of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; and Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata, who served as Hamas' Minister of Justice.\n\nREMAINS OF SHIRI BIBAS, MOM OF TWO KILLED, ALLEGEDLY RETURNED TO ISRAEL FOLLOWING HAMAS' BROKEN PROMISE\n\nA view of demolished buildings and damage in the city of Rafah, Gaza, after Israeli airstrikes.(Abed Zagout/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nOver the past day, the IDF said it \"struck dozens of terror targets and terrorists throughout the Gaza Strip, including mid-level and senior-ranking terrorists in Hamas' Political Bureau.\"\n\n\"The strikes were conducted to damage Hamas' governmental and military capabilities, and to remove threats to the State of Israel and its citizens,\" the statement said. \"The IDF will continue to operate against the Hamas terrorist organization and remove any threat to the State of Israel.\"At least 404 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed in the airstrikes so far, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The death toll has not been independently verified.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration backed Israel's move to end the ceasefire in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Brian Hughes told Fox News.\n\nIsrael will intensify its military actionsagainst Hamasmoving forward, authorities said.\n\n\"Under the direction of the political echelon, the IDF and Shin Bet are widely attacking terrorist targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, more details below,\" the IDF and ISA said.\n\nNetanyahu with Defense minister Israel Katz, IDF chief Eyal Zamir.

The military offensive will continue as long as necessary, and will expand beyond air strikes, the official said.\n\nDozens of targets were chosen, based on Hamas readiness to execute terror attacks, and build up and re-arm its forces. Following a situational assessment by Katz and the IDF officials, a decision was made not to open up schools and educational activities in the Gaza Envelope, authorities said.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the airstrikes came after Hamas \"rejected all offers it received\" from the Trump administration's special envoy to the Mideast, Steve Witkoff, and the other mediators.\n\nHAMAS FREES THREE MORE HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE THAN 300 PRISONERS AS PART OF CEASEFIRE DEAL WITH ISRAEL\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a security assessment after the ceasefire with Hamas disintegrated this week.(Prime Minister of Israel )\n\n\"Tonight, we returned to fighting in Gaza due to Hamas' refusal to release the hostages and threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities,\" Katz said. \"If Hamas does not release all the hostages, the gates of hell will open in Gaza, and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before.\"\n\nHe noted that Israel \"will not stop fighting until all the hostages return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"\n\nThe Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and move toward the center of the territory after its airstrikes across the territory, suggesting that the military could launch renewed ground operations into Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas blamed Netanyahu \"and the Nazi Zionist occupation fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"\n\nThe terror group called for theUnited Nationsand the U.N.
