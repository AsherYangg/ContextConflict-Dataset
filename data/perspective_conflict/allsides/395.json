        "source_1": "US announces $65m bounty for arrest of president, who has led country since 2013 and failed to prove he won recent vote\n\nVenezuela’s authoritarian president,Nicolás Maduro, has been​ accused of a shameless and fraudulent power-grab after swearing himself in for a third term, despite domestic outrage and a chorus of international condemnation at his alleged theft of last year’s election.\n\n“This is a great victory for Venezuelan democracy,” the 62-year-old autocrat boasted during a sparsely attended oath-taking ceremony in Caracas that was boycotted by the leaders of democratic nations.\n\n​As Maduro extended his 12-year rule, the US announced a $65m bounty for his arrest and those of two close allies on international drug-trafficking charges and rejected Maduro’s claim to the presidency.\n\nMaduro, who has led Venezuela in an increasingly repressive direction since being democratically elected in 2013, has failed to produce any proof that he won the 28 July vote. His opponents havepublished detailed evidencethat their candidate, Edmundo González, was the actual winner thanks to widespread public anger at Venezuela’s economic collapse.\n\nBut on Friday morning, it was Maduro – who has refused to relinquish power and been backed by military and security chiefs – who had Venezuela’s yellow, blue and red presidential sash draped over his shoulders at the national assembly.\n\nAmong those who skipped the event in protest were the leftwing presidents of Brazil and Colombia, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Gustavo Petro, longstanding regional allies who have refused to recognize Maduro’s claim to victory.\n\nThe authoritarian presidents of Cuba and Nicaragua, Miguel Díaz-Canel and Daniel Ortega, occupied front row seats, and the authoritarian leaders of China and Russia, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, also sent envoys.\n\nIn a rambling but defiant 90-minute speech, Maduro claimed he was spearheading “a democratizing revolution” in Venezuela and cast himself as the fearless anti-imperialist leader of an “eminently democratic project” inspired by Latin America’s independence heroes.\n\nHe lambasted his political foes as violent and “putrid” fascists and oligarchs, calling Argentina’s rightwing president, Javier Milei, a far-right “Zionist Nazi” and “social sadist”.\n\n“I wasn’t made president by the US government or the pro-imperialist governments of the Latin American right,” Maduro declared. “I come from the people. I am of the people – and my power emanates from history and from the people!”\n\nMaduro’s swearing-in prompted a fresh outburst of international condemnation, including from members of the political left, which the Venezuelan strongman purports to represent.\n\n“I am someone from the left and from the political left I tell you: Nicolás Maduro’s government is a dictatorship,” said Chile’s progressive president, Gabriel Boric.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: “The Venezuelan people and world know that Nicolás Maduro clearly lost the 2024 presidential election and has no right to claim the presidency today. We stand ready to support a return to democracy in Venezuela.”\n\nThe UK’s foreign secretary, the Labour party MP David Lammy, said: “Nicolás Maduro’s claim to power is fraudulent. The outcome of July’s elections was neither free nor fair and his regime does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nLammy, as fresh sanctions were announced in coordination with the EU, targeting 15 individuals linked to Maduro’s regime, added: “The UK will not stand by as Maduro continues to oppress, undermine democracy, and commit appalling human rights violations.”\n\nKaja Kallas​, the EU​’s foreign policy​ chief, ​said: ​“Maduro lacks all democratic legitimacy.​”\n\nMélanie Joly,the minister of foreign affairs for Canada, which on Thursday formally recognized González as Venezuela’s president-elect, said: “Maduro’s shameless actions demonstrate that democracy and the rule of law cannot be taken for granted. We will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights.”\n\nThe US announced it was increasing its reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, for alleged drug trafficking offences, to $25m, and created a reward of $15m for information leading to the capture of Maduro’s longstanding defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López.\n\nBrazil’s president Lula shunned the inauguration with close ally, the senator, Jaques Wagner, telling local media: “The relationship with Venezuela has soured”.\n\nGonzález, a retired diplomat who only entered politics last year, had vowed to travel back to Venezuela from exile for an inauguration of his own. But on Friday afternoon his most important backer, the opposition leader María Corina Machado, announced that they had decided he would no longer come.\n\n“Edmundo will come to Venezuela to be sworn in as Venezuela’s president at the right time when the conditions are suitable,” Machado said in a video message recorded at a secret location. She blamed the decision on Maduro’s decision to activate Venezuela’s air-defense systems as a result of what she called his “delusional paranoia”.\n\nEarlier in the day, Gen Domingo Hernández Lárez, a top army commander, posted a video on social media of a Russian surface-to-air missile system being deployed in what was seen as a threat to shoot González’s plane down if he attempted to fly back to Venezuela.\n\nMachado insisted, however, that Maduro’s days were numbered and that a democratic transition was “very close”.\n\n“Have no doubt, this is over,” she claimed, calling on Venezuelans to protest. “Maduro has consolidated his coup and the violation of our constitution. It is time to do whatever is necessary to restore it.”",
        "source_2": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was sworn in for a controversial third term on Friday, despite unresolved disputes over the July presidential election and international pressure for him to step down.\n\n\"The power granted to me by the Constitution has not been given to me by a foreign government or a gringo government,\" Madurodeclaredin his inauguration speech. \"I have not been placed by the oligarchy. I come from the people. The power I represent belongs to the people and I owe it to the people.\"\n\nThe election results from six months ago suggest otherwise.\n\nMaduro, who has ruled Venezuela since 2013, was declared thewinnerby electoral authorities just hours after the polls closed on July 28. However, the announcement came without any disclosure of vote counts, raising skepticism about their legitimacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela's opposition collectedtally sheetsfrom over 85 percent of the electronic voting machines, revealing a strikingly different outcome: opposition candidate Edmundo González won by a landslide. These claims were validated by independent election monitors, including the U.S.-based Carter Center and the Organization of American States, who deemed the opposition's resultscredible.\n\nIn response, several countries, including the United States,recognizedGonzález as Venezuela's president-elect and demanded that Maduro provide electoral records to justify his claimed victory.\n\nThe disputed results triggered widespread protests across Venezuela, with thousands taking to the streets over the summer to denounce Maduro's rule. The governmentrespondedwith force, arresting over 2,000 demonstrators, killing at least 20, and launchingcampaignsencouraging citizens to report suspected opposition supporters.\n\nSince then, high-profile opposition leaders and activists have faceddetention. Gonzálezfledto Spain, while his ally, María Corina Machado, who had been barred from running for office, went into hiding.\n\nIn the days leading up to Maduro's inauguration, a new wave ofrepressionunfolded. Hundreds of protesters clashed with security forces in the capital city of Caracas on Thursday, and dozens of activists, opposition figures, and journalists were arrested. Machado, making her first public appearance in months, was brieflydetained, further fueling internationalcondemnationof what many are calling a stolen election.\n\nBut as Maduro prepares to solidify his grip on power, the spotlight has shifted to González. Over the past week, the opposition leader hastraveledacross the Americas, meeting with heads of state—including U.S. President Joe Biden—to rally support and pressure Maduro to step down.\n\nGonzález has vowed to return to Venezuela and assume the presidency by taking up residence in the official presidential palace. However, he has not disclosed concrete plans for how he intends to achieve this. Maduro, in turn, has dismissed these efforts as \"fascist conspiracies\" and has issued a$100,000 rewardfor information leading to González's capture, warning that he will bearrestedupon return.\n\nDuring his inauguration, Maduro—who has been in power for over 20 years—pledged a new era for Venezuela. \"I swear that this new presidential term will be one of peace, prosperity, equality and new democracy. I swear it by history. I swear it on my life. I will keep my word.\"\n\nYet his track record of stealing elections and imprisoning critics paints a different picture. With the nation divided and its democratic institutions under siege, Maduro's promises are unlikely to quell doubts about his leadership or resolve the political crisis gripping Venezuela.\n\nStart your day withReason.

        "source_3": "Opposition leader: “Whatever they do tomorrow, they will be completely buried.”\n\nVenezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, who has presided over the ruination of his country, will likely be inaugurated again as president on Friday despite evidence of having lost a July election to retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia and opposition mounting.\n\nMeanwhile, Maduro has been brutalizing the opposition. “The regime arrested more than 2,000 dissidents after the July election controversy triggered mass demonstrations,” The Wall Street Journalreported. “This week, regime forces arrested González’s son-in-law, Rafael Tudares, along with Carlos Correa, who is one of Venezuela’s most prominent advocates for freedom of expression.”\n\nOpposition leader María Corina Machado was briefly detained on Thursday after she finally reappeared following months in hiding from the government’s secret police. Machado appeared at an East Caracas demonstration protesting Maduro’s imminent inauguration; she stated, “All this strength that we have built and that grows every day prepares us to finish this final phase. Whatever they do tomorrow, they will be completely buried.”\n\nAhora mismo@MariaCorinaYAen Chacaopic.twitter.com/Jq2ZM4Biwg\n\n#ÚLTIMAHORA| María Corina Machado (@MariaCorinaYA): \"Toda esta fuerza que hemos construido y que crece cada día nos prepara para terminar esta fase final.

Firearms were fired during the incident. She was taken away by force. During the period of her kidnapping she was forced to record several videos and was later released.”\n\nHoy,#9Ene, saliendo de la concentración en Chacao, Caracas, María Corina Machado (@MariaCorinaYA) fue interceptada y tumbada de la moto en la que se trasladaba.

He then went to Argentina and Panama with the ballots from the July election to prove he had won. “We elected by a landslide, a good man and Edmundo Gonzalez. We have the proof of that victory, and the whole world knows it,” Machado toldFox News. “We won.”\n\nJOIN THE MOVEMENT IN ’25 WITH 25% OFF DAILYWIRE+ ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS WITH CODE DW25\n\n“What we need is for all American institutions [to] understand that Venezuela is the most important conflict in the Western Hemisphere for national security of the U.S.,” Machado said. “We can be the best ally the United States will have in the Americas, first of all, because we also are desperate to solve the migration problem in our region. We want those Venezuelans to come back in billions and voluntarily. And that will happen when they’ll see there’s a future in their country. … Maduro has lost everything but fear and repression. Maduro lost all popular support, all legitimacy, and even he’s weakened or isolated internationally. What has he left? Russia, Iran, Hezbollah.”\n\n“The regime has sent secret police units to encircle her family members’ homes, sent a drone over her mother’s house, and kidnapped President-elect Gonzalez’s brother-in-law on Tuesday,” Fox Newsnoted.\n\nIn addition, Hezbollah has provided support to Maduro’s regime, according to theAtlantic Council. “Too often, Hezbollah in Venezuela is characterized as only a potential terrorist threat. In reality, the Lebanese terrorist group has helped to turn Venezuela into a hub for the convergence of transnational organized crime and international terrorism. Hezbollah’s crime-terror network in Venezuela has facilitated Iran’s cooperation with the Maduro regime,” the Atlantic Council has reported.\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.
