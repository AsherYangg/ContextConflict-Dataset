        "source_1": "WASHINGTON – President-electDonald Trumphad only kind words to say aboutJimmy Carter upon hisdeathon Sunday, calling the former president “a truly good man” who will be missed.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, flags were flying at half-staff on Monday in Carter’s honor.\n\nTrump offered a far less charitable view of Carter when he was alive.\n\nFor years, Trump, a Republican, has mocked the one-term, Democratic commander-in-chief as the nation’s worst president. Just two months ago, on Carter’s 100th birthday, Trump suggested the terminally ill centenarian was happy becauseJoe Bidenhad finally replaced him as the worst president ever.\n\nCarter often gave as good as he got. AGeorgia peanut farmerbefore he got his start in politics, Carter was no Georgia peach when it came to his assessment of Trump.\n\nWhen late-night TV host Stephen Colbert asked him in 2018 if Americans wanted “kind of a jerk” as their leader, Carter didn’t miss a beat. \"Apparently, from this recent election, yes,” he retorted.\n\nEarlier this year, Carter suggested to his son, Chip Carter, that he wanted to live long enough to vote for Trump’s rival,Vice President Kamala Harris, in November. Two weeks before election, Carter’s office confirmed that he hadvoted by mail. For Harris.\n\nAmid the barrage of insults and smack talk were temporary moments of rapprochement between the 39thand the 45thpresidents.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Carter occasionally came to his defense.\n\nCarter not only attended Trump’s first inauguration, he was the first former president to RSVP. Later that year, in 2017, Carter suggested the media had been harder on Trump than any other president. Trump responded by tweeting a message of thanks to Carter for “the nice remarks.”\n\nJimmy Carter on long life, philanthropy:'I've had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence'\n\nIn 2019, Trump’s White House announced thatCarter had written Trumpa “beautiful” letter about trade talks with China and that the two men had had a \"very good telephone conversation\" on China and other topics.\n\n\"The president has always liked President Carter andFirst Lady Rosalynn Carterand extended his best wishes to them on behalf of the American people,\" the White House statement said.\n\nIn 2014, Trump joked that Carter was dead, even though the former president was very much alive. While speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump referred to the \"late, great Jimmy Carter.\"\n\n“Of course I don't think Jimmy Carter is dead,” he tweeted later amid criticism for the gaffe. “Just being sarcastic,” he said, adding, “but never thought he was alive as President, stiff!\"\n\nOn several occasions, Trump called Carter the worst president in history – at least untilBarack Obamacame along.\n\n\"I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!\" Trump said in 2014.\n\nTrump, who has a tendency tochange his storiesto suit his audience, offered a slightly different take after Biden defeated him in 2020. He suggested several times that Biden, not Obama, had replaced Carter as the worst president ever.\n\nJimmy Carter state funeral:President to be honored in Washington before burial in Georgia\n\nFor his part, Carter called Trump “a disaster” of a president during a 2018 interview with The Washington Post and suggested the Republican held “an attitude of ignorance toward the truth.”\n\nThe next year, Carter told his church congregation in Plains, Georgia, that Trump had called him to discuss the letter he had sent to Trump about China. Carter suggested China would likely surpass the U.S. as an economic superpower because it had been able to avoid the military entanglements that have drained funds that might otherwise have been spent on infrastructure.\n\n\"I don’t really fear that time, but it bothers President Trump, and I don’t know why,” Carter said. “I’m not criticizing him – this morning,\" he added.After Trump was elected to a second term in November, Carter, who had been in hospice for nearly two years, announced he would not attend Trump’s inauguration but would be there if not for his deteriorating health.\n\nIn a pair of statements after Carter’s passing, Trump made reference to his disagreements with the former president.\n\nThis time, however, he not only dispensed with the insults, he even suggested that Carter had earned his respect.\n\n“While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,” he wrote. “He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

A Democrat, he was the longest-living president in U.S. history.\n\nWithin hours, Trump wroteon his social media platform, Truth Social: \"Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History.\n\n\"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\"\n\nMany of Trump's supporters, however, were enraged at the President-elect's comments,as Raw Story first reported.\n\n\"Lol, I know you're being nice. But you're tripping,\" posted Theodore Winters, who identifies himself on Truth Social as a \"conservativeRepublicanartist,\" according to Raw Story. \"Carter was a terrible president and damaged The United States Of America to such an extent that we are STILL dealing with his horribly policy decisions and his inflation repercussions in 2024.\"\n\nUser John55, who identifies himself as an \"America First\" veteran, posted: \"Jimmy Carter pardoned all the Vietnam draft dodgers that forced other men to take their place!

In October, on Carter's 100th birthday, Trump had a dig at PresidentJoe Biden, calling Biden \"the worst president,\" and declaring that Carter must be \"the happiest man because Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison,\"The Associated Pressreported.\n\nReports noted that Trump did not make note of Carter's milestone birthday or the fact that he had been under extended hospice care. Advocacy group American Bridge 21st Century labeled the comment \"cruel\" and claimed that \"nothing is sacred or off-limits for Trump.\"\n\nMany of the comments on Trump's Truth Social post riffed off of Trump's previous sentiment, calling Carter a \"terrible president\" or the \"worst president in history.\"\n\nAhead of the 2024 election.Carter had said he was\"only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThe former president is survived by his sons John William, James Earl and Donnel Jeffrey; his daughter, Amy; 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. His wife Rosalynn Carterdied at the age of 96in November 2023.\n\nA user called Commieskillpuppies warned that Trump's statement wouldn't make a difference with liberals, writing on Truth Social:\"I appreciate your graciousness toward him but it won't win you any points from the leftists. They're soulless. Besides a skunk by any other name would still stink to high heaven. He was not a good President. But he wasn't our worst. Biden wins that award.\"\n\nAnother user, Chicabonita2145, who identifies themselves as a Trump supporter in their Truth Social bio, wrote:\"Jimmy Carter was the worst President in history.\"\n\nThere will be two public observances for Carter—one in Atlanta, Georgia, and another in Washington, D.C., followed by a private interment, The Carter Center said in a statement. Details on when the ceremonies will be held are still pending.\n\nBiden said Sunday that he is ordering a state funeral for Carter in the nation's capital, meaning that it will occur around the same time as Trump's inauguration. Last year, Biden said at a fundraiser that Carter \"asked me to do his eulogy\" when the time came.\n\nMonica is a Newsweek reporter based in Boston. Her focus is reporting on breaking news.

When a reporter asked Biden what Trump should take fromCarter's legacy, Biden replied, \"Decency.\"\n\n\"Decency, decency, decency,\" Biden said. \"Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone who needed something and just keep walking?

Their sunk costs are enormous but they won’t cut them loose and own the cover-up or the complicity.\"\n\nLegal analyst Jonathan Turleycontrasted Biden with Carter over the former's broken promise to not pardon his son Hunter. Carter's younger brother Billy was scrutinized for his business relationship with Libya during the Carter administration.\n\n\"Instead of showing Carter's honesty, Biden lied for years and then pardoned his own son after repeatedly denying that he would ever do so during the campaign. He pardoned his son for any crimes committed over a ten-year period, including potential crimes that many believe implicated the President himself in the multimillion influence-peddling operation,\" Turleywrote in a threadon X.\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter attends the starting day of the 24th Jimmy Carter Work Project in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on October 29, 2007.(Mario Anzuoni/File Photo)\n\n\"Biden is one of the most INDECENT humans to ever be near the White House,\" radio host Joe Pagliarulo wrote on X. \"He's a garbage human who enriched himself and his family through influence.

But Joe Biden called Carter ‘decent’—and then attacked Trump. Talk about indecency.\"\n\nAnimator Doug TenNapel fired off a lengthy screed on Biden's remarks, saying he'd done damage to the country with his \"indecent\" presidency and would have been better suited working at a gas station.\n\n\"I pray that he found faith, because that is not only his only hope for salvation, it is all of our hope. Being merely decent doesn't cut it for him or anyone else,\" he wrote.\n\nJIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DEAD AT 100\n\nTrump and Carter clashed before and during his presidency, but the president-elect paid tribute to Carter on Truth Social, saying Americans owed him a \"debt of gratitude\" for his service.\n\n\"Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,\" Trump posted. \"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans.
