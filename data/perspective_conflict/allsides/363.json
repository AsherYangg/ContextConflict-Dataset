        "source_1": "During the last election, economics was on everyone's minds. Despite the greater economy being healthy with an extraordinary job market not seen since the 1960s, people told pollsters that they wereextremely upset about the high cost of livingthat had been brought on by the disruption of the pandemic and took a couple of years to finally sort out. Inpoll after poll, Americans said that inflation was the biggest problem facing the nation.\n\nWhen asked what he planned to do about this, then-candidate Donald Trump's only answers were \"tariffs!\" and \"growth.\" It was the cure-all for every economic pain that ailed us. Here he is answering a question about what specific legislation he would propose to deal with the high cost of child care. Yes, you guessed it: tariffs.\n\nHe promised over and over again that he was going to lower the cost of living and he made it clear that the way he planned to do it was with his beloved tariffs. Well, we're about to find out how that's going to work.\n\nOver the weekend,Trump followed through on his threatsto impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China. Imported goods from those nations will be hit with the new penalty beginning Tuesday, ostensibly because of immigration and fentanyl coming over the borders, which is ridiculous. There's no need to discuss Trump's obsession with immigration except to say that Mexico has been cooperating fully with U.S. demands and there simply is not a problem with illegal immigration at the Canadian border except maybe from Americans trying desperately to escape Trump's dystopia.\n\n\"We have fought and died alongside you… during your darkest hours … we were always there standing with you …grieving with you the American people.\"\n\nAs for fentanyl, Trump claims that 200,000 people have died from fentanyl this year (I assume he really meant last year.) But that's wrong too.Fentanyl overdoses were down 21% last yearand in total didn't even come to half that number. Obviously, all overdose deaths are a tragedy but how Trump thinks hitting Mexico and Canada with tariffs is supposed to solve America's drug problem is a mystery. Of course, in his mind they are instruments of magical power so perhaps he can make them work.\n\nCanada responded immediately to the announcement with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivering what may be remembered as his finest speech just as he prepares to leave office. It made me, and I would imagine, plenty of other Americans feel a deep sense of shame at what our president is doing to our closest allies:\n\n\"We have fought and died alongside you… during your darkest hours … we were always there standing with you …grieving with you the American people.\"\n\nOne might have understood Trump aiming tariffs at China, which is the United States' greatest economic adversary, but then his co-president Elon Musk has important business there so perhaps that wouldn't be prudent. But these demands on Canada and Mexico are incredibly vague and impossible for either country to actually accede to, raising the question of what he's really after with these draconian hits on two of America's closest allies and trading partners.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugmanwondered the same thingand hypothesized that it's \"essentially a dominance display. And the many people pointing out that it’s a terrible idea probably only reinforced his determination to show that he’s in charge and smarter than anyone else.\" That sounds right, especially when you hear his recent rhetoric around America's relationship with the world.\n\nWhile signing the Laken Riley Act, Trump rambled on about his recent confrontation with Colombia over the treatment of migrants being returned to their country.He said,\"we may have tough talk from others, but it's not going to mean anything. They're going to all take them back and they're going to like it too. They're going to like it.\" It's like he's speaking in old movie dialog these days.\n\nThe other day when hevirtually attended the World Economic Forumhe said, \"One thing we’re going to be demanding is we’re going to — be demanding respect from other nations.\" In the next breath came this, so we know what he was thinking of in his stream-of-consciousness \"weave\":\n\nCanada.  We have a tremendous deficit with Canada.  We’re not going to have that anymore.  We can’t do it.  It’s — it’s — I don’t know if it’s good for them.  As you probably know, I say, “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we won’t have a deficit.  We won’t have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera.”\n\nI think everyone has assumed that he is just trolling his younger, more handsome nemesis, Trudeau, with this endless talk about Canada becoming the 51st state – but at this point, you have to wonder. With his recent obsession with territorial expansionism and all the talk of buying (or seizing, if necessary) Greenland and taking back the Panama Canal, it seems that he has truly absorbed the idea that the United States should be growing its territory. His threats to Canada have become even more unhinged in recent days, suggesting that the US plans to choke its economy into subservience:\n\nWe pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We donât need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viableâ¦\n\n— Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts)February 2, 2025\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer?Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIt's nonsense, of course.The trade deficit with Canada is minor and it is not a subsidy.He's very confused about all of this. But it seems more and more obvious that he's seriously entertaining fantasies of being some sort of world conqueror. If it's a negotiating tactic, it's a mighty weird one.\n\nWe'll soon see if he really means to carry out this inane tariff plan. The markets may react badly which has, in the past, served as a moderating influence on him at least in the short term. (The Wall St. Journal called his plan\"the dumbest trade war in history.\")\n\nHe told reportersthat he will be holding a call on Monday with Mexico and Canada, so maybe they can head this off before chaos reigns. If he's been watching Fox News he may have detected a little bit of a problem:\n\n\"It seems like virtually every sector of the American economy\" — Fox News has put together a scrolling list of the \"goods affected by Trump tariffs\" ð¬pic.twitter.com/nofdk3IrEZ\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump never admitted that his tariffs would cause prices to go up. He evaded it at every turn, saying that energy costs were the only cause of inflation and he was going to \"drill, baby, drill.\" He now admits that it may very well happen but says, \"it will be worth the price that must be paid.\" Paid by average Americans, not him of course. And possibly some of his erstwhile supporters in the business community who really didn't think he'd be dumb enough to kill the golden goose.\n\nThis is a person suffering from severe grandiose delusions and they're getting worse. But I'm afraid this is just the tip of the iceberg. His co-president Elon Musk is suffering from the same malady and they've banded together to take America and the rest of the world on their wild, psychotic ride-along.

        "source_2": "Predictions for economic growth, stock market, inflation, interest rates most optimistic in past seven years\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans are the most optimistic they have been in the past seven years about several aspects of the U.S. economy, particularly economic growth and the stock market. Majorities of Americans expect both indicators of economic health to go up this year, while 41% are hopeful that interest rates will fall, exceeding the 35% saying interest rates will rise.\n\nThe public is divided over whether unemployment will increase (38%) or decrease (38%) -- although at a time of relatively low unemployment, the 21% expecting the rate to hold steady could be viewed as positive. A slim majority of Americans, 52%, predict that inflation will rise, but that is down significantly from recent years.\n\nMultiple line charts. Americans' predictions for how five economic indicators will perform in the next six months. Americans are optimistic about the outlook for Economic growth, inflation rates, interest rates, unemployment and the stock market over the next six months.\n\nGallup has asked Americans to predict the six-month trajectory for these economic indicators in five of the past seven years -- in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2025. Prior to that, it tracked the question nearly every month from October 2001 through 2005 and periodically between 2007 and 2014.\n\nThe latest results are based on a Jan. 2-15 survey, conducted shortly before President Donald Trump took office. Except for unemployment, Americans are more positive about these economic indicators than they were in 2019, during Trump’s first term, before the pandemic sent the economy into a brief but deep recession. The U.S. economy bounced back in 2021 but was plagued by inflation rates not seen in four decades. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an attempt to slow inflation. Meanwhile, unemployment has stayed low, economic growth has been steady, and the stock market has reached record highs.\n\nAmericans’ current outlook on the stock market is the most optimistic Gallup has recorded, while the percentages expecting interest rates, unemployment and inflation to worsen are among the lowest.\n\nSolid majorities of Republicans believe all five economic factors will improve over the next six months. This includes three-quarters who say the stock market and economic growth will increase over the next six months and six in 10 who say inflation and interest rates will go down. Nearly as many, 57%, expect unemployment to go down, while 20% believe it will go up.\n\nIndependents share Republicans’ positive expectations for economic growth and the stock market, but to a lesser degree. Six in 10 independents believe both will go up. However, more independents think that inflation will get worse (by going up) than predict it will improve (by going down), while they are divided on whether interest rates and unemployment will improve or worsen.\n\nA slim majority of Democrats, 51%, believe the stock market will increase in the next six months, but only one in five expect economic growth to improve. Three-quarters of Democrats expect inflation to rise, perhaps because of Trump’s pledge to impose tariffs on U.S. imports. A majority of Democrats think the unemployment rate will increase, and close to half, 48%, think interest rates will rise.\n\nRepublicans and independents are more optimistic that all five aspects of the economy will improve than they were in January 2023, the last time the question was asked. This was at the midpoint of former President Joe Biden’s term. Slightly more Democrats now than in 2023 expect the stock market to increase and interest rates to decrease, but far fewer now expect economic growth, inflation and unemployment to improve.\n\nChanges in Republicans’ outlook are generally larger than those for the other party groups, including a 59-percentage-point increase in the percentage expecting economic growth to improve (by going up) and a 49-point decrease in the percentage predicting inflation to improve (by going down). Those changes contrast with a 32-point drop in Democrats’ expectations for economic growth to improve -- the largest movement on any measure for Democrats -- and a 21-point shift on inflation.\n\nRepublicans’ expectations for economic growth and unemployment were similar to now in 2019, when Trump was president and the economy was generally healthy. Likely reflecting changing economic conditions since then, Republicans are more inclined now than in 2019 to believe the stock market will go up (75% vs. 58%) and to think interest rates (63% vs. 9%) and inflation (60% vs. 20%) will go down.\n\nAmericans are generally hopeful about the economy in the next six months. Part of this optimism stems from Republicans expecting things to improve under a Republican rather than Democratic president. But the broader improvements in Americans’ outlook may also reflect their confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the economy. During his first term, he received some of his strongestissue approval ratings on the economy, which were typically higher than those Biden received on the issue during his term.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates,follow us on X@Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how theGallup Poll Social Seriesworks.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted by ReconMR Jan. 2-15, 2025, with a random sample of 1,005 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
