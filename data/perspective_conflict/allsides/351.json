        "source_1": "Announcement comes after former majority leader ceded his position earlier this year\n\nI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read ourPrivacy notice\n\nSenatorMitch McConnellofKentuckyannouncedon Thursday he will not be seeking reelection next year at the end of his term, bringing to a close a four-decade career in theSenate.\n\n“Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of my lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time,” McConnell said in a floor speech. “My current term in theSenatewill be my last.”\n\n“Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,” he continued. “But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.”\n\nTheRepublican, who made the announcement on his 83rd birthday, was thelongest-serving Senate party leaderin U.S. history, spending nearly 20 years leading the GOP conference in the upper house through multiple presidential administrations, including a stint from 2015 to 2021 as Senate Majority Leader.\n\nJohn Thuneof South Dakota wasrecently electedto replace McConnell as Senate Majority Leader in the new Congress.\n\nMcConnell, first elected in 1984, spent his final years in office clashing withDonald Trump, becoming one of the rare members of the party to split with the GOP standard-bearer.\n\nThe senator was thesole Republican to oppose the Trump administration’s nominationsof Tulsi Gabbard to be Director of National Intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. McConnell cited his own experience of polio as one of his reasons for not supporting Kennedy, a longtime conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer.\n\nMcConnell alsoopposedthe nomination of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThese stances earned fiercecondemnationsfromTrump, who earlier this month accused McConnell of letting “theRepublicanparty go to hell.”\n\n“If I didn't come along, the Republican party wouldn't even exist right now,”Trumpsaid. “Mitch McConnellnever really had it. He had an ability to raise money because of his position as leader, which anybody could do.”\n\nThe rift began long before Trump’s reelection, however.\n\nMcConnell broke with many in his party and accepted Joe Biden’s 2020 election win. He put further distance between himself and the MAGA core by declaring Trump “morally responsible” for the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAt the same time, McConnell also helped deliver Trump’s impeachment acquittal in the Senate over the Capitol riot.\n\nPrior to the 2020 election, McConnell helped set the stage for a key part of Trump’s legacy.\n\nIn late 2020, the senatorhelped secure Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrettto the Supreme Court roughly a week before the presidential election, after opposing President Obama’s election-year nomination of Merrick Garland to the high court four years earlier.\n\nThe first Trump administration also passed its signature set of tax cuts while McConnell led the Senate GOP.\n\nIn addition to a complicated relationship with the president, McConnell’s final act also saw the Kentuckian battle a series of health problems and concerns about his fitness to serve.\n\nMcConnellreportedlysuffered multiple falls at the Capitol in recent weeks and was later pictured being pushed in a wheelchair.\n\nIn 2023, McConnell also alarmed observers whenhe froze and appeared unable to answer a questionat a press event inKentucky.\n\nMcConnell’s final term sees Republicans once again holding unified control of both houses of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has concentrated most of its political capital outside of the legislature, instead preferring to useElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency initiativeto slash spending and cancel contracts without waiting for congressional input.\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

It marks the end of a 40-year tenure in the Senate, during which he oversaw atransformation of the nation’s federal courts.\n\n“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,” McConnell said in a speech firstshared with The Associated Press. “Every day in between I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here.

Straight Facts™.\n\nMcConnell is the longest-serving Senate party leader in American history. He was elected to head the Republican conference nine times between 2006 and 2023.\n\nIt is an extraordinary rise and unmatched retention of power for a man who began his career on Capitol Hill as an intern and worked his way up to chief legislative assistant and deputy assistant attorney general during the Ford administration.\n\nMcConnell stepped down as Republican leader at the end of 2024. He said this was to make way for someone younger, who wasmore alignedwith President Donald Trump’s ideology.\n\nMcConnell has also experienced aseries of medical episodesin recent years. He recently fell while exiting a meeting and was seen in a wheelchair later that afternoon.\n\nIn 2024, he froze while speaking with reporters on multiple occasions. The incidents were caught on camera and led many to ask whether he was still strong enough to be the Senate Republican leader.\n\nMcConnell shepherded three of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees through the Senate, solidifying the court’s 6-3 conservative majority. That would not have been possible had he not kept thelate Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat openby denying former Attorney General and federal judge Merrick Garland a nomination hearing in the final year of the Obama administration.\n\nMcConnell also helped confirm hundreds of judges to the appellate and district courts.\n\nMcConnell diverged from Trump on foreign policy. He fully supports Ukraine and wants to continue American financial and military support for the country. His support hasn’t swayed, even after President Trump called President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections”.\n\n“Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,” McConnell said in his prepared remarks. “But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.”\n\nMcConnell made the announcement about his retirement on his 83rd birthday.\n\n“The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence,” he said in his speech. “And, to the disappointment of my critics, I’m still here on the job.”\n\nHe is married to Elaine Chao. She served as the secretary of the Transportation Department during the first Trump administration.\n\nChao also served as secretary of Labor during the Bush administration. He has three daughters.\n\nTop Republican right-winger Mitch McConnell announces leaving U.S. Senate\n\nMitch McConnell Won't Seek Reelection In 2026, Ending Long Tenure As Republican Power Broker\n\nFormer GOP Leader Mitch McConnell won't seek re-election in 2026\n\nMitch McConnell announces retirement after 2026, ending four decades in the Senate\n\nMitch McConnell Finally Announces He Won’t Run Again.

        "source_3": "WASHINGTON — Sen. Mitch McConnell,the longest-serving party leader in the upper chamber’s history, announced Thursday that he will not seek re-election in 2026.\n\nIn a parting floor speech, McConnell (R-Ky.) recounted how his journey from interning for former Sen. John Sherman Cooper (R-Ky.) to leading the Republican conference for 18 years fulfilled “a childhood dream.”\n\n“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business right here,” McConnell said in the address, which coincided with his 83rd birthday.\n\n“Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.”\n\nMcConnell revealed that he made the decision not to run last year and had communicated that to his conference after stepping down as Senate leader following the 2024 election.\n\nFirst elected in 1984, the Kentucky senator navigated the realignment of the Republican Party’s coalition — from the interventionist and limited-government approach of President Ronald Reagan to the isolationist and economically populist leanings of President Trump.\n\n“Here every debate over agriculture or infrastructure or education or taxes is downstream of the obligations of national security,” he said in his Senate speech. “Every question of policy here at home is contingent on our duty to provide for the common defense.”\n\n“Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening American hard power was well underway when I arrived in the Senate,” he went on.\n\n“But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.”\n\nMcConnell also leaves behind a legacy of having completely remade the US Supreme Court, handing it a conservative majority during the first Trump administration with the installation of three justices — after having blocked Merrick Garland’s appointment under President Barack Obama.\n\n“I certainly didn’t expect to have three Supreme Court justices,” hetold the New York Times in a 2020 interviewafter the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n“At the risk of tooting my own horn, look at the majority leaders since [Lyndon Johnson] and find another one who was able to do something as consequential as this.”\n\nAn aide told the Times that the then-Senate majority leader confided in Trump of Barrett’s confirmation: “This will be the hardest fight of my life.”\n\nBut McConnell broke with the 45th president over Trump’s “rigged” election claims that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot — and has voted against some of the 47th commander-in-chief’s cabinet nominees at the start of his second term.\n\n“To the disappointment of my critics, I’m still here on the job,” the Kentuckian boasted in his final words on the floor, hinting at exerting further influence over his party and the White House during his final years in office.\n\nMcConnell also thanked his wife, Elaine Chao, who served as Trump’s transportation secretary during his first term, for her “leadership and wise counsel,” calling her “the most seasoned campaign aide in modern history.”\n\n“Her devotion to me and to Kentucky is a lot more than I deserve,” he added.\n\nMcConnell has faced health obstacles that bookended his rise to power — including a childhood battle with polio that left his left leg paralyzed.\n\nMoreserious freeze-upsandfalls in recent yearsleft him with bruises, broken ribs and at times forced him to use a wheelchair, but those went unmentioned in Thursday’s speech.\n\nWithin minutes, former Kentucky GOP gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron, an ex-McConnell aide,announcedhe was running for his former boss’s seat in the Senate."
