        "source_1": "The Catholic Church and federal government reacted vehemently to new legislation in Washington state that requires priests to report child abuse or neglect to law enforcement after learning about the crime through confessions.\n\nGov. Bob Fergusonsigned the controversial bill into lawlast week, making it mandatory for all clergy to report child abuse, without exemptions for information disclosed during confession. Confessions were previously consideredprivileged.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Seattle — which was made up of 160 priests and 90 permanent deaconsas of 2024— said it will excommunicate priests who comply with the legislation. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice called the law \"anti-Catholic\"in a statementannouncing a probe into the policy, just days before the Vatican selected the first pope from the United States.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocesein a statement, warned that breaking the confidence of confession is grounds for a priest to be kicked out of the church, essentially reiterating the rules already established for Catholic clergy.\n\n\"Catholic clergy may not violate the seal of confession — or they will be excommunicated from the Church,\" the Archdiocese said. \"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential and protected by the law of the Church.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said it had opened a civil rights investigation into Washington's law, focusing on how it was developed and eventually passed. It suggested the legislation could be at odds with the First Amendment, with Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon saying the legislation \"demands that Catholic Priests violate their deeply held faith in order to obey the law.\"\n\nIn the text of Washington's reporting law, \"clergy\" refers collectively to everyone ordained for religious duties in any religion, but confession as a practice is singled out because of the secrecy around it.\n\nFerguson's office addressed the federal probe in a statement to CBS News.\n\n\"We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this 'investigation' from the Trump Administration,\" the statement said.\n\nWashington lawmakers are not the first to try to mandate clergy members to report child abuse, especially as the Catholic Church has increasingly faced public reckonings over sex crimes since the turn of the century. Although a majority of U.S. states already have abuse reporting mandates in place for religious leaders, each of those laws includes a provision exempting information learned through confession.\n\nCalifornia tried in 2019 to propose a bill that would have required clergy to report abuse without that exemption, but the churchfought its passageand the legislature eventually put it on hold.\n\nThe legislation was originally proposed by Washington State Senator Noel Frame, whose jurisdiction includes Seattle. After two earlier attempts to pass this bill failed because of disagreements about whether confessions should be exempt from reporting mandates, the final version passed during the legislative session this spring.\n\n\"Far too many children have been victims of abuse,\" said Framein a statementonce the latest bill had passed in the state Senate. \"The Legislature has a duty to act and end the cycles of abuse that can repeat generation after generation. When kids ask for help, we need to be sure that they get help. It's time to pass this bill once and for all.\"\n\nThomas Plante, a psychologist and Santa Clara University professor who has worked with the church for decades and written extensively about child sexual abuse among clerics, said removing exemptions for confession could have unintentionally adverse effects.\n\nPlante told CBS News that the \"absolute\" confidentiality understood to apply in church confessions has, in his experience, encouraged people who have committed crimes to come clean to a priest who has then referred them to a psychologist such as himself.\n\nHe said multiple patients were referred to him this way over his career, and he then reported the situation to authorities as a medical professional.\n\n\"The seal of confession, which is sort of a global thing that's been going on for several thousand years, is basically that anything you say under the seal is in complete confidence, and it gives people a place to talk about stuff they can't talk about anywhere else,\" Plante said. \"That's one advantage. People that are involved in a crime or abuse or anything else, they do have a place in the Catholic Church to talk about it with 100% confidentiality.\"\n\nWithout that assurance, Plante said he suspects priests in Washington will stop offering confession and instead direct people to seek that service at churches in nearby states.\n\n\"And I think that would be a terrible tragedy,\" he said.\n\nConfession is a core principle in Catholicism. It calls for private conversations where congregants or laypeople divulge their wrongdoings to a priest, and, in turn, receive forgiveness on behalf of God. Anything said during the exchanges is kept secret.\n\nTechnically, priests, through their religious oaths, are bound to a seal of confidentiality after hearing confessions, and the church forbids them from sharing the information learned in those sessions with others. Catholic doctrine explicitly prohibits them from notifying authorities even after someone has confessed to a crime.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese said they agree \"with the goal of protecting children and preventing child abuse\" and are committed to reporting it, as long as the information is acquired in a setting outside of confession. It also accused the state of Washington of violating constitutional protections for religious establishment and free exercise of religion.\n\n\"With this law, the State of Washington is specifically targeting religious conduct by inserting the government into the Catholic tradition, namely, the highly defined ritual of the Sacrament of Reconciliation,\" the Archdiocese said.\"The state is now requiring priests to violate an essential element of the rite, the confidential communication between the priest and penitent in which the absolution of sin is offered.\"\n\nWashington's new law requires priests to share information from confession only if the person confessing admits to abusing a child.\n\nLast year, while Washington's current governor, Ferguson, was still the state's attorney general, hepushed to investigateCatholic church leadership in Seattle, Spokane and Yakima for allegedly using charitable funds to cover up allegations of child sex abuse by clergy. But the probe faced challenges as the church refused to cooperate, arguing it did not need to obey subpoenas for its records.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated to correct the Washington governor's first name.\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe Catholic Church has issued a warning to its clergy in Washington state: Any priest who complies with a new law requiring the reporting of child abuse confessions to authorities will be excommunicated.\n\nThe new law, which will take effect on July 27, eliminates the long-standing confidentiality of the confessional, forcing Catholic leaders and lawmakers into a highly charged standoff over religious liberty and child protection.\n\nHowever, the Archdiocese of Seattle and several bishops argue that the law not only contravenes church doctrine but crosses constitutional lines, while supporters maintain it is a crucial step to protect minors from abuse.\n\nNewsweekcontacted the Archdiocese of Seattle and Washington Governor Bob Ferguson and the three Democratic state senators who sponsored the bill for comment via email and online inquiry forms.\n\nThe issue spotlights the enduring tension between religious freedom and the state's duty to protect children from abuse. By compelling clergy to breach the confessional seal, Washington joins a small group of states stripping traditional confidentiality protections.\n\nThe law has triggered a national conversation about the boundaries of church and state, setting a precedent that could have implications for religious practices and privileged communications nationwide. The outcome may influence how other states approach mandated reporting requirements for clergy, especially as constitutional and civil rights groups enter the debate.\n\nWashington's new statute requires clergy to report suspected child abuse, explicitly denying exceptions for information revealed during confession.\n\n\"Catholic clergy may not violate the seal of confession—or they will be excommunicated from the Church,\" the Archdiocese of Seattle warned, according toFox News.\n\nThe Catholic Church's canon law regards breaking the confessional seal as a grave offense: \"A confessor who directly violates the seal of confession incurs an automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See.\"\n\nThe U.S.Department of Justicesaid it is investigating whether the law infringes on First Amendment religious protections.\n\nVoting by the College of Cardinals to select the next pope is set to begin Wednesday, following thedeath of Pope Francis on April 21.\n\nFrancis' funeral took placeat the Vatican on April 26, with dignitaries including U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr ZelenskyandPrince Williamin attendance.\n\nThe current favorites are Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, according to U.K.-based bookmaker William Hill, with odds of 12/5 (29.4 percent) and 3/1 (25 percent), respectively.\n\nOn April 2, Trump sparked controversy by sharing an AI-generated image thatdepicted him as the popeon his Truth Social website.\n\nSpeaking toNewsweekProfessor Michele Dillon, an expert on Catholicism at the University of New Hampshire, said:\"This is highly controversial because it directly challenges a core element of the Catholic faith...For the government to require priests to report any instance of sex abuse that they learn about through the sacrament of confession would directly violate the core of the sacrament and its significance in Catholics' lives. The Church has made significant strides in recent years to safeguard children from sex abuse, and so it's unfortunate that the controversy stoked by the Washington State law – and the church's opposition to it based on core theological belief and practice – may erroneously convey to people who are not familiar with the full meaning of the sacrament that the Church is opposing the requirement simply to evade dealing with the issue of sex abuse.\"\n\nAddressingNewsweek,Professor Anthea Butler, chair of the department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, commented:\"This is about 'the seal of the confessional' That is, the rule that when a priest hears a confession, it cannot be shared. If it is shared, it's breaking Canon Law. A priest can be excommunicated for breaking the seal of the confessional.\n\n\"The situation, which the Trump administration is looking at, is interesting because there has always been this collision between the law of the local, state and national level and some aspects of canon law. Think about this not only on this level, but in issues of other types of transgressions, like murder. Terrible situation, but the for the priest, they are subject to canon law.\"\n\nTheArchdiocese of Seattle:\"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential and protected by the law of the Church.\"\n\nArchbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle:\"Priests cannot comply with this law if the knowledge of abuse is obtained during the Sacrament of Reconciliation.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon told theNew York Post:\"SB 5375 demands that Catholic Priests violate their deeply held faith in order to obey the law, a violation of the Constitution and a breach of the free exercise of religion.\"\n\nWashington Governor Bob Ferguson:\"We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this 'investigation' from the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe law's implementation is set for July 27, unless halted by litigation or further legislative action. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division review could determine whether the statute will stand or be blocked on constitutional grounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic bishops indicate they are prepared to face legal consequences rather than violate Church law. This standoff may provoke broader reevaluation of confidentiality protections in other states, as well as the balance between religious freedom and mandated reporting.\n\nUpdate 7/5/25, 10:30 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include comment from Professor Michele Dillon.\n\nUpdate 8/5/25, 2:30 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include comment from Professor Anthea Butler.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.
