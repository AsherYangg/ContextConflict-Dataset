        "source_1": "Employers across the U.S. added 228,000 jobs in March, pointing to a labor market that remains resilient despite economic headwinds from President Trump'stariffsand sticky inflation.\n\nEconomists expected that employers had hired 130,000 people last month, according to financial data firm FactSet. That compares with a revised 117,000 additions in February, according to financial data firm FactSet.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.\n\nWhile the March numbers beat forecasts, economists are also cautioning thatMr. Trump's new tariffs, announced on April 2, could crimp economic growth, raising the risk of a recession. Economic downturns like recessions are typically accompanied by a sharp increase in unemployment.\n\n\"Today's better-than-expected jobs report will help ease fears of an immediate softening in the U.S. labor market. However, this number has become a side dish with the market just focusing on the entrée: tariffs,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.\n\nThe labor market's strength may provide an additional reason for the Federal Reserve to hold off on cutting rates anytime soon, said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management.\n\n\"The solid March jobs report highlights an economy that remains resilient despite sticky inflation, a drop in consumer confidence and uncertainty surrounding the impacts from recently introduced tariffs,\" Gaffoglio added.\n\nStill, the number reflects \"a moment of calm before the storm hits,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\n\n\"The market needed today's number. Everyone knows that economic weakness is coming, but at least we can be reassured that the labor market was robust coming into this policy-driven shock and therefore, the slowdown should not be overly steep,\" Shah said.\n\nShe added, \"Next month is when hard data is likely to start showing signs of what soft data has already been signalling.\"\n\nAimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

        "source_3": "‘The Claman Countdown’ panelists Peter Tuchman and Bob Michele unpack market volatility amid tariff fears.\n\nThe U.S. economy continued to add jobs in March and the pace of job gains picked up at a faster pace than a month ago despite economic uncertainty.\n\nThe Labor Department on Friday announced that employersadded 228,000 jobsin March, above the estimate of LSEG economists, who anticipated 135,000 jobs gained.\n\nTheunemployment ratewas 4.2%, slightly higher than a month ago and above economists' expectations. The number of jobs added in the prior two months were both revised, with job creation in January revised down by 14,000 from a gain of 125,000 to 111,000; while February was revised down by 34,000 from a gain of 151,000 to 117,000.\n\nTaken together, the revisions reduce previously reported employment by 48,000 jobs.\n\nJOB APPLICATIONS BY FEDERAL WORKERS SURGE AT AGENCIES TARGETED BY DOGE\n\nPrivate sector payrolls added 209,000 jobs in March, well above the 127,000 projected by LSEG economists.\n\nGovernment payrollsadded 19,000 jobs in March. Within the sector, federal employment declined by 4,000 jobs in March after a decline of 11,000 jobs in January. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that employees on paid leave or are receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed in the establishment survey.\n\nManufacturing added1,000 jobs last month, coming in below the 4,000 jobs LSEG economists anticipated the sector would add.\n\nHealthcare added 53,600 jobs in March, trending close to the average monthly gain of 52,000 over the past 12 months. Employment rose in ambulatory healthcare services (+19,800), hospitals (+17,100), and nursing and residential care facilities (+16,700).\n\nDOGE CUTS DRIVE LAYOFFS IN MARCH TO HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE PANDEMIC\n\nThe healthcare sector added the most jobs in March.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nSocial assistance roles added 24,200 jobs in March, above the average monthly gain of 19,000 over the past 12 months. Most of the growth was in individual and family services, which accounted for 21,900 of the job gains.\n\nRetail added 23,700 jobs in March, with workers returning from a strike contributing to gains at food and beverage retailers (+20,700), while general merchandise retailers lost 4,800 jobs. The sector has seen little change in employment over the last year.\n\nTransportation and warehousing added 22,900 jobs in March, which nearly doubled the average gain over the past 12 months of 12,000. Within the sector, job gains in couriers and messengers (+15,800) and truck transportation (+9,600) were partially offset by job losses in warehousing and storage (-9,400).\n\nThe labor force participation rate was 62.5%, which has changed little over the month and past year.\n\nCONSUMERS' SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC EXPECTATIONS FALL TO LOWEST LEVEL IN 12 YEARS, TRIGGER RECESSION WARNING\n\nMarch's job gains come amid increasing uncertainty about the economy amid renewed concerns about inflation and higher prices for consumers caused by PresidentDonald Trump'stariffs, which have caused U.S. stocks to decline in recent days.\n\n\"The March employment report has to be viewed as backward looking, but on balance was a touch stronger than expected and gives the Federal Reserve the space to keep policy on extended hold as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's aggressive actions on inflation,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"We expect the tariffs to push inflation close to 4% this year.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays a signed executive order imposing tariffs on imported goods during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nConcerns over a widening trade war and the impact of tariffs on inflation have caused an increase in analysts'expectations of a potential recession.\n\n\"Investors may find some solace here but most likely, this employment report will be overshadowed by the tension bubbling up in global trade, particularly with China,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. \"The Fed's job got a lot more complex as inflation is not yet under control. Trade policy could become the catalyst which pushes the economy into recession.\"\n\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-Deremer said in an appearance on FOX Business' \"Varney & Co.,\" \"I couldn't be more positive and happy for this jobs report this month — 228,000 jobs, we blew it out of the market, we blew it out of the water. That is not what people were expecting, but they are responding to Trump's vision and Trump's economy.\"\n\nFederal Reserve ChairJerome Powellis expected to speak later on the economic outlook. Central bank policymakers held rates steady at their last meeting in March, and Powell said they will be monitoring inflation data for signs of increasing price pressures, including those attributable to tariffs.\n\nEconomic uncertainty has caused the market's expectations for interest rate cuts to shift, as they now see a 40% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in May, an increase from about 22% a day ago and 19% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
