        "source_1": "WASHINGTON — TheSupreme Courton Fridayhanded a loss to Republicans by allowing Pennsylvania voters who sent mail-in ballots that were flagged as being potentially defective to submit a separate provisional in-person ballot.\n\nThe justices rejected, with no noted dissents, a Republican request to put on hold a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling from last week.\n\nThe Supreme Court action marks \"an important reaffirmation of the right to vote in Pennsylvania,\" said Ben Geffen, a lawyer who represented voters in the case.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, one of the court's conservatives, wrote a brief statement saying that, although it is an issue of \"considerable importance,\" there were several reasons for the court not to get involved at this stage. His statement was joined by two other conservatives, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThe case, as Alito noted, arose from a dispute over two ballots submitted during the\"long-completed\"Democratic primary in Butler County this year. Although it is unclear exactly how many ballots the legal theory would affect if it applied to the general election, it could beseveral thousandand have major legal ramifications if any statewide contests are close in the key swing state.\n\nThe Supreme Court action does not definitively resolve the legal issue, which could yet return to the justices.\n\nMany of Pennsylvania's counties, which administer elections,  already allowed for voters to cast provisional ballots if their mail-in ballots lacked a secrecy envelope even before the recent state Supreme Court ruling. Some did not.\n\nThe state court had concluded that mail-in ballots that machines detect as lacking secondary “secrecy envelopes” required under Pennsylvania law are void, therefore allowing the voter to cast a provisional ballot, a finding that Republicans had argued against.\n\nSuch ballots automatically lead to voters in many counties being notified that there are problems with the ballots that can be remedied by voting in person.\n\nAs a result of the state court ruling, all counties must now accept provisional ballots if a voter submitted a deficient mail-in ballot, Geffen said. However, he added, not all counties notify voters if there is a problem with their mail-in ballot.\n\nIn another court ruling on Friday that further clarified the rules of the road heading into Election Day, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made it clear that undated or incorrectly dated mail-in ballots will not be counted.\n\nTaken together, the two cases \"take away a lot of the uncertainty regarding lawsuits over voting rules in Pennsylvania,\" said Rick Hasen, an expert on election law at the UCLA School of Law and an NBC News contributor.\n\n\"While it's still possible for these issues to come back in the event of a very close election, the chances are now significantly diminished,\" he added.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Harris-Walz campaign welcomed the Supreme Court decision, saying in a joint statement that former President Donald Trump \"and his allies are trying to make it harder for your vote to count, but our institutions are stronger than his shameful attacks.\"\n\nA Republican National Committee spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.\n\nIn their filing at the Supreme Court, Republicans said that state law requires any ballots that do not meet the strict standards to be rejected and does not allow for voters to get a do-over. Under their interpretation of the law, that would include not just ballots lacking the secrecy sleeve, but also ballots that are not dated, not dated correctly or lack a signature.\n\nThe state, which was not sued and is not a defendant in the case, filed a friend-of-the-court brief at the Supreme Court urging the justices not to intervene, saying the ruling from the top state court did not institute a dramatic change.\n\nLawyers for the state wrote that Supreme Court intervention would only serve to prevent two votes in the Democratic primary from being counted months after the fact.\n\nThe litigation raises a legal question of interest to conservatives on the Supreme Court about whether the ruling from Pennsylvania's high court unlawfully encroaches on the Legislature’s authority to set election rules under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe issue was the subject of a Supreme Court ruling last year that largely rejected the “independent state Legislature” theory, which says legislatures have unfettered authority over elections, while leaving the door open to revisit the matter in future.\n\nRepublicans in the 2020 election repeatedly argued that Democratic officials and state courts inappropriately changed election rules, mostly to address health concerns raised by the Covid pandemic. Those cases provided fodder for then-President Donald Trump’s failed efforts to overturn his election loss. Trump in 2020 also frequently railed against the expanded use of mail-in voting.\n\nThe latest case arose when two Butler County voters, Faith Genser and Frank Matis, sent defective mail-in ballots in the Democratic primary election and were notified they would not be counted. They subsequently cast provisional ballots in person.\n\nThey filed a lawsuit after being told that the votes would not be counted. The Republican National Committee then intervened.\n\nGenser and Matis lost in a trial court, but an intermediate appeals court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in their favor, prompting Republicans to appeal again to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and affiliated lawyers have filed a slew of lawsuits ahead of the 2024 general election in swing states, including Pennsylvania, with Trump among thosefueling unfounded concernsof widespread election fraud.\n\nIn 2020, President Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by just over 80,000 votes.\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.",
        "source_2": "The Supreme Court rejected a request from Republicans asking it to block a lower court ruling that gave Pennsylvania voters access to provisional ballots if they botched their mail-in ballots, potentially opening up the battleground state tothousands of votesthat would not have been cast if the Supreme Court sided with the GOP—as the court faces an anticipated slew of last-minute cases over state voting rules before Election Day.\n\nThe Republican National Committeeaskedthe Supreme Court on Monday to block a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling allowing voters to cast provisional ballots if their mail-in ballots have errors, like lacking a signature or date on an envelope.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the request Friday, saying in a filing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision concerns just two votes made in Pennsylvania’s months-old primary and that staying the court’s ruling would not result in “any binding obligation” on the Pennsylvania officials “responsible for the conduct of this year’s election.”\n\nThe ruling comes after the court took up a matter concerning Virginia voting, as Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyaresaskedthe Supreme Court on Monday to nullify a lower court ruling that blocked the state from carrying out a purge of its voter rolls to remove 1,600 alleged noncitizens, which the federal government noted also resulted in U.S. citizens being removed in error.\n\nJustices sided with the state Wednesday in a 6-3 decision, throwing out the lower court ruling and allowing Virginia to move forward with the voter purge—not offering any explanation for the decision and only noting that liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied Virginia’s request.\n\nThe Justice Department had argued removing the voters is unlawful because it was done too close to Election Day, as federal lawbarsstates from removing voters from voter rolls less than 90 days before an election, and lower federal district and appeals courts sided with the federal government, ordering Virginia to restore voters to the voter rolls.\n\nIt remains to be seen how many more disputes the high court will be asked to take up before Election Day.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump—also asked the court to weigh in on his candidacy, requesting that his name be taken off the ballot in Michigan and Wisconsin despite voting already being underway. The courtdeniedthose requests on Tuesday, leaving Kennedy on the states’ ballots.\n\nIf and how the Supreme Court could affect the election. Trump and his allies asked the court in 2020 to take up a series of post-election disputes challenging President Joe Biden’s win, as the ex-president fought in court to try and overturn the election results. The Supreme Court uniformlyrejectedall of those challenges, but it remains to be seen how the 6-3 conservative court will act if asked to weigh in on any post-election challenges again this cycle. Justices alreadygave Trump a winahead of the general election by swatting down efforts by Democrats to disqualify him from state ballots under the 14th Amendment, ruling states cannot remove federal candidates.\n\nThe Supreme Court seemingly gave itself more leeway to shape states’ election rules with its 2023 ruling in voting caseMoore v. Harper, Voxnotes. The court struck down a legal theory in that case that Trump and his allies tried to use to overturn the 2020 election, which claimed state legislators should have widespread authority to determine election rules—a power Trump wanted state lawmakers to use to reject their states’ election results and declare Trump the winner. That being said, justices also ruled state courts can’t oppose state legislators’ election rules in a way that “exceed[s] the bounds of ordinary judicial review.” The court didn’t clarify exactly what that means in practice and what those bounds of ordinary review are, but Vox notes the ruling could make it easier for the Supreme Court to overrule state courts and side with state legislators, if the justices believe those courts have acted improperly.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have brought dozens of lawsuits challenging voting rules ahead of Election Day, particularly as Trump and his allies have sowed distrust in election results and the electoral process. The RNC haslauncheda massive “election integrity” effort targeting voting practices the party believes will enable voter fraud—even as evidence shows such fraud is exceedingly rare and there is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in recent elections. As GOP-led states havetightenedvoting rules in response to Trump’s fraud claims, Democrats have also filed numerous lawsuits seeking to expand voter access. While legal battles have been playing out in the courts for months,legal rulingshave ramped up ahead of Election Day, and Marc Elias, a voting rights attorney aligned with the Democratic Party,saidSunday 199 challenges remain pending in 40 states.",
        "source_3": "‘Special Report’ anchor Bret Baier takes a look back at how previous presidential debates have impacted the polls.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld a state court ruling that allowed for the counting of certain provisional ballots, in a major setback for the state GOP and Republican National Committee just four days before the election.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and the state GOPfiled an emergency appealto the nation's top court last week seeking to temporarily halt a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that ordered the state to count voters whose provisional ballots had been incorrectly filled out or were missing an inner \"secrecy\" envelope.\n\nAttorneys for the Republican Party urged the Supreme Court to grant a full stay of the state’s decision, writing in a final reply brief submitted Thursday evening that such an order would \"prevent multiple forms\" of \"irreparable harm\" to the state.\n\nAt a minimum, the court was urged to grant a \"segregation order\" to allow the ballots to be set aside and counted separately.\n\n\"The actual provisional ballots contain no identifying information, only a vote,\" the GOP's lawyers wrote. \"Once ballots are separated from their outer envelopes, there is no way to retroactively figure outwhich ballotswere illegally cast. In other words, once the egg is scrambled, it cannot be unscrambled.\"\n\nTHE 1.6M VOTERS WHO COULD DETERMINE THE US ELECTION DON’T CURRENTLY RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY\n\nA person walks past Montgomery County's voter services van in King of Prussia, Pa., Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2024.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nAt issue is a lower court ruling in Butler County, Pa., where a local election board had disqualified provisional ballots cast by two residents in the 2024 primary election. That duo joined the Pennsylvania Democratic Party in a lawsuit that sought to have their votes counted, which ultimately was the outcome granted by a state Commonwealth Court and upheld last week by a 4-3 Pennsylvania Supreme Court majority.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted in its ruling that provisional votes can be counted only after a person’s eligibility to vote and the rejection of their mail-in ballot are confirmed.\n\n\"Counting Electors’ provisional ballots, when their mail ballots are void for failing to use a Secrecy Envelope, is a statutory right,\" state Supreme Court Justice Christine Donohue wrote in the majority opinion, adding that the rule in question is \"intended to alleviate potential disenfranchisement for eligible voters.\"\n\nIn their response to the Supreme Court Wednesday, opponents argued that Republican plaintiffs had left out important case history in the state — primarily, that in the six years since Pennsylvania's General Assembly had updated its voting law in 2019 to allow mail-in ballots, \"most county boards of elections, and most Pennsylvania courts to consider the issue, have counted provisional ballots submitted by voters who had made a disqualifying mistake in attempting to complete their mail ballots.\"\n\nIn fact, Butler County was among the few counties that refused to count provisional ballots for votes that were lacking secrecy envelopes, until it became the subject of a lawsuit earlier this year by the two plaintiffs whose votes were not counted.\n\n\"Applicants, advancing a divergent interpretation of state law,askedthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take the case and decide it before the 2024 General Election,\" they wrote. \"Last week the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did just that. That the RNC does not like the result is no reason for this Court to intervene on an emergency basis and disrupt the status quo on the eve of the election.\"\n\nThat wascontested by Republican plaintiffs.In joining the state GOP in the lawsuit, lawyers for the Republican Party described the case as one of \"paramount public importance, potentially affecting tens of thousands of votes in a state which many anticipate could be decisive in control of the U.S. Senate or even the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\n26 REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL JOIN VIRGINIA IN PETITIONING SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON VOTER ROLL\n\nSupporters at a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.(Jeff Swensen for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nThe appeal comes as Republicans have filed nearly 100 election-related court challenges in recent weeks, legal challenges they say are aimed atpreventing voter fraudthrough absentee and mail-in ballots. (Democrats, in return, have sought to position themselves as the party that supports free and fair elections, seizing on the Republican lawsuits as a means of disenfranchising voters.)\n\nMany of the lawsuits have been filed in one of seven swing states considered pivotal for either candidate to win the presidency.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Republican Party’s decision to join a lawsuit over provisional ballots in the final days of the campaign is likely a strategic move, analysts said—a \"placeholder\" of sorts that allows them to cite a preexisting legal challenge in a swing state that they can point to in pushing for courts to act after an election.\n\nIt’s \"absolutely\" easier to get a court to involve itself in a case after an election if plaintiffs already have a legal challenge on the books, Andrew McCarthy, a former U.S. assistant attorney general for theSouthern District of New York, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\nIn those cases, \"you could at least look [judges] in the eye and say, ‘look. I'm not asking you to change the result of the election, I'm asking you to address the rules, which is what we tried to do before,’\" McCarthy said.\n\nThis is especially important in Pennsylvania, the battleground state with the most electoral votes at stake in 2024.\n\nAPPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST GOP IN CASE CHALLENGING 225K VOTER REGISTRATIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\nVoters fill out their ballots on Election Day in Columbus, Ohio on November 7, 2023.

Mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania have been lower so far in 2024 than 2020, when many relied on that process due to COVID-19 precautions.\n\nMore recently, New York University law professor Richard Pildesestimated that the casecould affect between 400 and 4,000 ballots in the state – though his \"back-of-the-napkin\" math focused solely on naked ballots, and not others sent with incomplete information.\n\nIn a close race, the wave of recent court cases has led some observers to fear the lawsuits will either disenfranchise would-be voters, keep one or the other candidate's supporters from participating in the election or sow doubt about the election results.\n\nBut analysts told Fox News they doubt that any of these lawsuits will have a protracted impact on the 2024 election, despite the additional scrutiny and media coverage.\n\n\"In the five presidential elections I've covered, I don't think any pre-election challenge had a huge impact,\" George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a lot of litigation, but I would be surprised if we have any jugular hits,\" Turley said.\n\nIn a joint statement Friday night the Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee praised the high court's decision.\n\n\"In Pennsylvania and across the country, Trump and his allies are trying to make it harder for your vote to count, but our institutions are stronger than his shameful attacks,\" they told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Today’s decision confirms that, for every eligible voter, the right to vote means the right to have your vote counted.\"\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\n\nBreanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
