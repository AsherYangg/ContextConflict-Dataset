        "source_1": "Romania’s pro-European Union, centrist presidential candidate Nicușor Dan won the country’s election Sunday, defeating his ultranationalist rival in a shocking upset.\n\nWith 100% of the votes counted, the centrist candidate won nearly 54% of the ballots cast, a clear win overhard-right candidate George Simion, who is a fan of US President Donald Trump.\n\nSimion, who opposes providing military aid to Ukraine and is critical of the EU, looked on track to win the election after he swept the first round on May 4. But Dan gained ground after trouncing Simion in a televised debate.\n\nWhile addressing a crowd of his jubilant supporters on Sunday, Dan said that the vote proved the “incredible power of the Romanian society,” according to Reuters. “Elections are about community. In today’s elections, a community of Romanians who want a profound change in Romania won,” the 55-year-old mayor said.\n\nHe also encouraged his supporters to “have patience,” saying a “difficult period lies ahead, but necessary in order to balance the economy of this country, to build the foundations of a healthy society.”\n\nDan, who is currently the mayor of the capital Bucharest, is a strong supporter of Romania’s NATO membership and has pledged to continue providing aid to Ukraine, which he sees as key to Romania’s own security against the threat from Russia. He also campaigned on a promise to crack down on corruption.\n\n“I feel relieved. I am happy. I feel hopeful,” voter Alina Enache, 42, told Reuters. “I’m happy that we’re not heading towards the extremist way.”\n\nSimion conceded defeat in a video posted to X on Sunday night, despite calling himself the “new president” earlier in the day. But he also vowed to continue to fight alongside the “sovereigntist patriots and conservatives around the world.”\n\nHe still captured the support of Romania’s diaspora, one of the largest of any country in the world. About 60% of the diaspora voted for Simion in the first round. Since then, he spent a lot of time outside Romania, traveling to Austria, Italy, Poland, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, in an effort to win over voters abroad.\n\n“It was an honor for me to represent our movement in this battle. We lost this battle, but we didn’t and will never lose our war,” Simion said.\n\nThe election comes five months after the result of the original vote, which saw former far-right outsider Calin Georgescu surge in popularity, was annulled over allegations of Russian interference.\n\nGeorgescu was later banned from this month’s rerun after being charged with various crimes, including founding a fascist group.\n\nRelated articleGerman spy agency labels far-right AfD ‘extremist’\n\nMore than 10 million Romanians cast their vote in Sunday’s election, which was widely seen as a choice between East and West and a litmus test for the rise of Trump-style nationalism in Europe.\n\nAn array of European leaders congratulated Dan on his victory, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, Poland’s Donald Tusk and Moldova’s Maia Sandu.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also applauded Dan’s “historic victory” and Romania’s role as a “reliable partner” to Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed her eagerness to work with Dan as he becomes the country’s new leader.\n\n“The Romanian people have turned out massively to the polls. They have chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe. Together let’s deliver on that promise,” von der Leyen said on X.\n\nOn Sunday, Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said that the “hallmarks of Russian interference” were seen in the election.\n\n“A viral campaign of fake news on Telegram and other social media platforms is aimed to influence the electoral process. This was expected and authorities debunked the fake news,” Tarnea said.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded by questioning the integrity of the election. “It’s impossible to interfere in something like that — only to get smeared in it. So don’t smear anyone else with your electoral mess,” she asserted.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added on Monday that “the elections were strange, to say the least” and criticized the earlier removal of far-right candidate Georgescu.",

We have to build Romania together, regardless of political options, with the Romanians in Romania, diaspora, (Republic of) Moldova and the Romanians in the neighbouring countries,” Dan said. At the same time, his supporters chanted “unity”.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Dan and said Ukraine is \"looking forward to further developing the strategic partnership between our friendly nations for the sake of their stability, security and prosperity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and other leaders also congratulated Dan.\n\nA record turnout of 11 million Romanians, or 64%, in Romania and the diaspora, marked by fear and resentment, has turned the page on a six-month-long political turmoil sparked by the annulled presidential elections.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Simion declared himself \"Romania’s new president\" at his party's gathering in the Romanian parliament in Bucharest before the official count began.\n\n\"A new era is born tonight. It is time for an epoch in which Romania be democratic, Christian and rich. So help us God,\" Simion announced.\n\n\"We are the clear winners of these elections. We claim the victory in the name of the Romanian people. It is the victory of the humiliated Romanian people,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not matter which side each of us has been in these elections, this is democracy, we now need to shake hands.”\n\nSimion also thanked the Romanian diaspora, whom he visited extensively over the last days of the presidential campaign earlier this week.\n\n\"I owe today’s victory to the Romanian diaspora. You Romanian who left abroad, you must know that only with you we can make Romania great among the states of the free world.\"\n\n\"I don’t promise miracles, but I promise to be among you,\" he concluded.\n\nSimion then left the stage to the sound of Village People's \"YMCA,\" one of US President Donald Trump’s favourite tracks on his 2024 campaign trail.\n\nIn the last hours of the voting, Romania's foreign, interior and defence ministries denounced what they called “Russian interference,” warning voters about a fake news campaign rolled out on Telegram, TikTok and other social media platforms.\n\nThe Romanian foreign ministry spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said on X Sunday that “once again we see the distinctive signs of Russian interference (…) to influence the electoral process.\n\nIn a coordinated move, the three ministries revealed that a fake video published on Sunday “falsely claims that French troops in Romania secretly wear Romanian gendarmerie uniforms to intervene internally,” has been linked directly to Russia.\n\nTelegram founder Pavel Durov revealed that he refused a request from “a Western country”, which he didn’t name, to “silence” the conservative voices in Romania.\n\n“Telegram will not restrict the liberties of Romanian users, nor will it block their political channels,” Durov said.\n\nLearn more from Euronews Romania's live coverage of the presidential election repeat's runoffhere.",
        "source_3": "Pro-EU Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan has defeated Euroskeptic candidate George Simion in Romania’s presidential election rerun, according to the official tally.\n\nWith more than 99% of ballots counted, Dan secured 54% of the vote in Sunday’s runoff, while Simion received 46%.\n\nDan thanked his supporters for an“unprecedented mobilization.”\n\n“Starting tomorrow, we begin the reconstruction of Romania – a united and honest Romania, founded on respect for the law and for all its people,”he wrote on X.\n\nSimion, the leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), did not initially concede defeat, claiming in a post on X on Sunday evening that he was“the new president.”However, he conceded several hours later and congratulated Dan.“It was the will of the Romanian people. We will go all the way, even if it is hard to bear the bitter taste of defeat,”he said in a video address on Monday.“We may have lost a battle, but we will certainly not lose the war.”\n\nThe pro-EU president of neighboring Moldova, Maia Sandu, congratulated Dan.“Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens,”she said.\n\nThe two countries share deep historical and cultural ties, with around 30% of Moldova’s population holding dual Moldovan-Romanian citizenship. Simion’s party has claimed that Moldovan authorities and media outlets waged an illegal campaign to mobilize support for Dan among voters living in Moldova. Chisinau has denied any interference in the election.\n\nThe election rerun was ordered after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the November vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came first with 23%. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – claims Moscow has denied.\n\nSimion had condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a“coup d’état”and said that, if elected, he could appoint Georgescu as prime minister.\n\nDuring the first round on May 4, Simion received 41% of the vote, while Dan and former Senator Crin Antonescu each garnered around 20%.\n\n© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.
