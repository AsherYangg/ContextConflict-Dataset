        "source_1": "Global markets reacted sharply and swiftly after President Donald Trump revealed his much-anticipated tariff plans Wednesday, with investors fleeing U.S. stock indexes and stocks of companies that rely on global supply chains plummeting.\n\nS&P 500 futures, which indicate where it is likely to open Thursday, plunged 3%. Nasdaq 100 futures sold off by more than 4%, and Dow futures slid about 1,000 points, or 2%.\n\nThose indexesjust endured their worst quarter in yearsin large part because of growing concern about the economic impacts of Trump's expected tariff plan.\n\nGlobal markets also posted significant losses just minutes into their trading days. Japan's Nikkei 225 index plunged more than 4.1%, and South Korea's Kospi stock average fell more than 2.5%. Australia's ASX 200 dipped about 2%. ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that track specific countries, such as India, tumbled about 3%, while one that tracks Europe slid 2%, and the China ETF fell 3.8%.\n\nBut initial market indications early Wednesday evening were that many investors had expected Trump's tariffs to be far less expansive. In addition to a flat 10% tariff on all trading partners, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs that would tax many trading partners more than 20%.\n\n\"President Trump just finished his tariff speech at the White House and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as 'worse than the worst case scenario' the Street was fearing,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note sent Wednesday.\n\nThat could make things very difficult for large U.S. companies that are deeply integrated into the global economy.Shares of Apple dropped nearly 7%, Amazon 6% and Walmart 5%.\n\nNike, which produced 50% of its footwear in Vietnam last year, plummeted 7% in after-hours trading.\n\nShares of dollar store chains, which import many of their most popular goods, also faced steep losses. Five Below plunged 13.5%, and Dollar Tree sold off more than 11%.\n\nAsked whether he was concerned by the market moves, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television that he has “learned not to look at what goes on during after-hours markets.”\n\nBessent added that the Nasdaq has a \"'mag7' problem, not a MAGA problem,\" referring to seven large tech stocks often called the \"magnificent 7.\"\n\nGeneral Motors and Ford dropped less than 1%, but Jeep owner Stellantis tumbled almost 2%. Stellantis has more manufacturing in Europe than the other U.S. automakers.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimated that the price of a foreign-made car could soar by up to $15,000 under Trump's tariffs. Even a vehicle assembled in the United States could face a price hike of up to $8,000, according to the bank's analysts.\n\nSteve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.\n\nBrian Cheung is a business and data correspondent for NBC News.",
        "source_2": "Global stocks have sunk, a day after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs that are forecast to raise prices and weigh on growth in the US and abroad.\n\nStock markets in the Asia-Pacific region fell for a second day, hot on the heels of the US S&P 500, which had its worst day since Covid crashed the economy in 2020.\n\nNike, Apple and Target were among big consumer names worst hit, all of them sinking by more than 9%.\n\nAt the White House, Trump told reporters the US economy would \"boom\" thanks to the minimum 10% tariff he plans to slap on global imports in the hope of boosting federal revenues and bringing American manufacturing home.\n\nThe Republican president plans to hit products from dozens of other countries with far higher levies, including trade partners such as China and the European Union.\n\nChina, which is facing an aggregate 54% tariff, and the EU, which faces duties of 20%, both vowed retaliation on Thursday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for European firms to suspend planned investment in the US.\n\nTariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries, and Trump's plan that he announced on Wednesday would hike such duties to some of the highest levels in more than 100 years.\n\nThe World Trade Organization said it was \"deeply concerned\", estimating trade volumes could shrink as a result by 1% this year.\n\nTraders expressed concern that the tariffs could stoke inflation and stall growth.\n\nIn morning trading on Friday, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell by 2.7% and Australia's ASX 200 was down by 1.6%. The Kospi in South Korea was flat to slightly lower.\n\nMarkets in mainland China and Hong Kong are closed for the Qingming Festival.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 - which tracks 500 of the biggest American firms - plunged 4.8%, shedding roughly $2tn in value.\n\nThe Dow Jones closed about 4% lower, while the Nasdaq tumbled roughly 6%. The US shares sell-off has been going on since mid-February amid trade war fears.\n\nEarlier, the UK's FTSE 100 share index dropped 1.5% and other European markets also fell, echoing declines from Japan to Hong Kong.\n\nOn Thursday at the White House, Trump doubled down on a high-stakes gambit aimed at reversing decades of US-led liberalisation that shaped the global trade order.\n\n\"I think it's going very well,\" he said. \"It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on, and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.\"\n\nHe added: \"The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.\"\n\nContradicting White House aides who insisted the new tariffs were not a negotiating tactic, Trump signalled he might be open to a deal with trade partners \"if somebody said we're going to give you something that's so phenomenal\".\n\nOn Thursday, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said that country would retaliate with a 25% levy on vehicles imported from the US.\n\nTrump last month imposed tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, though he did not announce any new duties on Wednesday against the North American trade partners.\n\nFirms now face a choice of swallowing the tariff cost, working with partners to share that burden, or passing it on to consumers - and risking a drop in sales.\n\nThat could have a major impact as US consumer spending amounts to about 10% - 15% of the world economy, according to some estimates.\n\nWhile stocks fell on Thursday, the price of gold, which is seen as a safer asset in times of turbulence, touched a record high of $3,167.57 an ounce at one point on Thursday, before falling back.\n\nThe dollar also weakened against many other currencies.\n\nIn Europe, the tariffs could drag down growth by nearly a percentage point, with a further hit if the bloc retaliates, according to analysts at Principal Asset Management.\n\nIn the US, a recession is likely to materialise without other changes, such as big tax cuts, which Trump has also promised, warned Seema Shah, chief global strategist at the firm.\n\nShe said Trump's goals of boosting manufacturing would be a years-long process \"if it happens at all\".\n\n\"In the meantime, the steep tariffs on imports are likely to be an immediate drag on the economy, with limited short-term benefit,\" she said.\n\nOn Thursday, Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Fiat and other brands, said it was temporarily halting production at a factory in Toluca, Mexico and Windsor, Canada.\n\nIt said the move, a response to Trump's 25% tax on car imports, would also lead to temporary layoffs of 900 people at five plants in the US that supply those factories.\n\nOn the stock market, Nike, which makes much of its sportswear in Asia, was among the hardest hit on the S&P, with shares down 14%.\n\nShares in Apple, which relies heavily on China and Taiwan, tumbled 9%.\n\nOther retailers also fell, with Target down roughly 10%.\n\nMotorbike maker Harley-Davidson – which was the subject of retaliatory tariffs by the EU during Trump's first term as president – fell 10%.\n\nIn Europe, shares in sportswear firm Adidas fell more than 10%, while stocks in rival Puma tumbled more than 9%.\n\nAmong luxury goods firms, jewellery maker Pandora fell more than 10%, and LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) dropped more than 3% after tariffs were imposed on the European Union and Switzerland.\n\n\"You're seeing retailers get destroyed right now because tariffs extended to countries we did not expect,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategy at Freedom Capital Markets, adding that he expected more turbulence ahead.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\nScientists who analysed fragments that crashed into a roof in Georgia, US, say it likely formed 4.56 billion years ago.",

(Getty Images)\n\nU.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday after PresidentDonald Trumpannounced his latest plan for tariffs, sparking fears of a global trade war.\n\nTheDow Jones Industrial Averageplunged more than 1,679.39 or 3.98%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 4.84% and 5.97%, respectively.\n\nThe hardest hit sectors were consumer discretionary, energy and technology; consumer staples notched modest gains.\n\nTrump rolled out the latest tariffson Wednesday afternoon during an event at the White House Rose Garden, which he said is going to focus on imposing reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. Some of the levies were steeper than expected, especially against our Asian trading partners.\n\nThe president indicated that aside from the reciprocal tariffs, the administration will establish a minimum baseline tariff of 10%.\n\nTrump on Thursday said the roll-out of tariffs to an \"operation,\" and said it was \"going very well.\"\n\n\"The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, and the rest of the world wants to see Is there any way they can make a deal,\" Trump said Thursday as he departed the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on March 26, 2025. (Getty Images)\n\nPresidentDonald Trump'stariff plans are moving forward by levying taxes on imported goods that economists warn will lead to price increases for consumers that could push inflation higher and complicate the Federal Reserve's efforts to stabilize the pace of price growth.\n\nWith Trump's plans for a 10% tariff on all imports plus additional reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners, as well as sector-specific tariffs such as the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, either in force now or taking effect soon, price hikes related to tariffs could soon be reflected in the inflation data the Fed is monitoring.\n\nRyan Young, senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told FOX Business that he expects it will be \"about six weeks\" before price increases due to tariffs start impactinginflation data.\n\n\"Assuming Trump goes through with the auto and reciprocal tariffs in early April, prices should go up right away for many goods. That will then show up in April's CPI and PCE releases,\" which are due to be released in May, he said.\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts are due to take effect on April 3, and the auto tariffs are likely to be passed on to consumers quickly. An analysis by JPMorgan found that \"given strong pricing power, automakers will be able to pass on most of the tariffs\" and that thoseauto tariffs\"should boost vehicle prices by about 5%,\" which they added would be on top of previously announced tariffs.\n\n\"It appears the tariffs will be effective next week, so we think the increases will be apparent quite soon. We expect that the rise in inflation will squeeze real disposable income growth to below 1% next quarter, presenting a material headwind to consumption growth,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nU.S. stocks, while still down sharply early afternoon, are off the lows of the session. The Dow, for example, bounced off losses of more than 1,500 points.\n\nStill, investors took cover, buying a handful of more defensive names including AT&T, Goodyear, Coca-Cola, Kroger and Philip Morris.\n\nConsumer staplessuch as food and drink are considered safe havens during times of market volatility.\n\nCoke is also one of Warren Buffett's longtime, top positions.\n\nMicrosoft sharesare down Thursday but not as much as the broader market as of mid-morning. The tech-giant was down over 2% compared to the Nasdaq Composite's 5% drop.\n\nBitcoin, the largestcryptocurrency by market value, slipped on Thursday, falling to the $82,000 level.\n\nEven before PresidentDonald Trump's tariffs,cryptos lagged, with bitcoin off nearly 7% this year and down over 18% from its all-time high of $106,734.51 on Dec. 17, 2024, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden on April 2, 2025. (Getty Images)\n\nPresidentDonald Trumpdeclared Wednesday that \"foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency\" and his tariffs will \"strengthen the international economic position of the United States and protect American workers.\"\n\nDuring his Rose Garden remarks, Trump held up a poster board showing the combined rate of tariffs and other non-tariff barriers that other countries impose onU.S. exportsalongside the reciprocal tariffs the Trump administration plans to levy on imports from those countries. Among those included were:\n\nChina: 67%tariffs and other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 34% reciprocal tariffs\n\nEuropean Union: 39%tariffs and other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 20% reciprocal tariffs\n\nVietnam: 90% tariffsand other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 46% reciprocal tariffs\n\nJapan: 46% tariffsand other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 24% reciprocal tariffs\n\nIndia: 52% tariffsand other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 26% reciprocal tariffs\n\nSouth Korea: 50%tariffs and other trade barriers on U.S. goods; 25% reciprocal tariffs"
