        "source_1": "Jeffrey Goldberg has pushed back against the string of denials that poured in after he reported inThe AtlanticthatDonald Trumpallegedly raged at a slain U.S. soldier’s funeral bill by saying, “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f---ing Mexican.”\n\nThat alleged remark was regarding 20-year-old Vanessa Guillén, the Houston-born soldier who was murdered at Fort Hood in 2020—a horrific killing that led to leadership changes at the base and policy changes across the military. Trump offered to pay for the funeral to Guillén’s family, but reportedly never did.\n\nGoldberg’s bombshell report, which cited “contemporaneous notes” and people inside the White House meeting where Trump allegedly made the remark, has been called false by Trump’s then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the chief of staff to his secretary of defense, Kash Patel. A lawyer for the Guillén family and the soldier’s sister, Mayra Guillén, have also spoken out to assert that Trump never made such a brash comment.\n\nGoldberg, 59, said in a Tuesday night appearance on CNN, however, that the deniers are either uninformed or outright lying. He made clear that he stands by his reporting.\n\n“Given what you heard from your sources, what do you make of those denials?” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Goldberg.\n\nThe Atlantic’s editor-in-chief responded, “I don’t make much of them at all. The sister wasn’t in the meeting. The lawyer for the family wasn’t in the meeting.”\n\nGoldberg noted that Patel and Meadows were present for the alleged remark, but he insinuated that they’d refuted his report to protect Trump with less than two weeks to go before Election Day.\n\n“I have sources who are sitting in that meeting,” he said. “I have contemporaneous notes taken by participants in that meeting that described exactly what I described in the story. We’ve seen this pattern again and again and again. They deny, deny, deny, and then it comes out as true.”\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, on his interview with John Kelly: “I think this was probably the most shocking for him — the idea that Donald Trump would regularly tell him how much he admired Hitler.”pic.twitter.com/znU48mcatG\n\nGoldberg equated the senior officials’ denials to a previously damning report he penned, in which he alleged in 2020 that Trump disparaged killed-in-action troops by calling them “suckers” and “losers.” That report, which the MAGA world quickly shot down as false, was later confirmed by John Kelly, a former chief of staff to Trump.\n\n“This is the same thing that happened with the previous iteration of this,” Goldberg said Tuesday. “So it’s not surprising that Mark Meadows is going to deny it, but the denial doesn’t hold weight. I have contemporaneous sources and contemporaneous notes from that meeting. He said it. It also tracks with everything that we know about the way [Trump] speaks.”\n\nWithout a recording of the meeting, there’s sure to be a repeated back-and-forth on whether the comment was actually made or not. For now, all the public has to go by is Goldberg’s report and the fervent denials that have emerged since its publishing.\n\n“I was in the discussions featured inThe Atlantic’s latest hit piece against President Trump,” Meadows wrote in his statement on Tuesday. “Let me say this. Any suggestion that President Trump disparaged Ms. Guillén or refused to pay for her funeral expenses is absolutely false.”\n\nI was in the discussions featured in the Atlantic’s latest hit piece against President Trump. Let me say this.Any suggestion that President Trump disparaged Ms. Guillen or refused to pay for her funeral expenses is absolutely false.He was nothing but kind, gracious, and…\n\nMeadows added that Trump “was nothing but kind, gracious, and wanted to make sure that the military and the U.S. government did right by Vanessa Guillén and her family.”\n\nA statement from the Guillén family’s lawyer, Natalie Khawam, attacked Goldberg by name. She claimed that Goldberg had misrepresented their conversation in his article and that he’d printed a lie, but she stopped short of saying what exactly he’d allegedly lied about.\n\n“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg,” Khawam posted on X. “Not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story. More importantly, he used and exploited my clients, and Vanessa Guillén’s murder… for cheap political gain.”\n\nMayra Guillén’s statement on the article, posted to her account on X, accused Goldberg of politicizing her sister’s death. She also shared that the report came on the same day she voted early for Trump.\n\nWow.I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics- hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today.https://t.co/o8cDrKOKBV\n\n“I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics—hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members,” she wrote. “President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today.”\n\nWhile each denial asserted that Trump never uttered the words “f---ing Mexican” while speaking about Guillén, none refuted that Trump didn’t cover funeral costs like he’d promised to do when the Guillén family visited the White House.",

        "source_3": "A family attorney and the sister of slain Texas soldierVanessa Guillenboth dismissed a report in the Atlantic on Tuesday alleging that former President Donald Trump refused to pay for the Army specialist’s funeral and disparaged her ethnicity.\n\nThe piece, written by the magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, claims Trump fumed about a $60,000 bill he received from Guillen’s family for her funeral during a December 2020 Oval Office meeting — allegedly telling aides, “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f–king Mexican.”\n\n“Don’t pay it!” Trump ordered his then-chief of staff Mark Meadows, after previously telling the Guillen family he would assist with Vanessa’s funeral expenses, according to Goldberg.\n\nMayra Guillen, Vanessa’s sister, slammed the Atlantic report as “hurtful & disrespectful,” and indicated that the former president treated her family with “respect” in the aftermath of her sister’s brutal killing.\n\n“Wow,” Mayrawrote on X, in response to Goldberg’s reporting. “I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics – hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members.”\n\n“President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa,” she added. “In fact, I voted for President Trump today.”\n\nNatalie Khawam, an attorney for the Guillen family, accused the Atlantic editor of lying in the piece.\n\n“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” Khawamwrote on X.\n\n“More importantly, he used and exploited my clients, and Vanessa Guillen’s murder … for cheap political gain,” she added.\n\nKhawam called the “timing” of Goldberg’s report “quite suspicious.”\n\n“[T]his supposed conversation that Trump had would have occurred over 4 years ago!” the attorney noted. “Why a story about it now?!”\n\n“As everyone knows, not only did Trump support our military, he also invited my clients to the Oval Office and supported the I Am Vanessa Guillen bill too,” Khawam continued. “I’m grateful we were successful in getting bipartisan support of the I Am Vanessa Guillen Act, and because of everyone’s hard work and efforts our service members now have more protections and rights while serving our country.”\n\nGoldberg claims in his piece that Khawam told him “she sent the bill [for Vanessa’s funeral] to the White House, but no money was ever received by the family from Trump.”\n\n“Any suggestion that President Trump disparaged Ms. Guillen or refused to pay for her funeral expenses is absolutely false,” he wrote on X. “He was nothing but kind, gracious, and wanted to make sure that the military and the U.S. government did right by Vanessa Guillen and her family.”\n\nVanessa Guillen, 20, was killed at Fort Cavazos, formerly Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, in 2020 by fellow soldier Aaron Robinson, who committed suicide following a confrontation with police after Guillen’s body was found in the woods.\n\nRobinson’s then-girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar, helped dismember and hide Guillen’s body.\n\nShepleaded guiltylast year for her role in the crime and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nAn investigation by military officials into Guillen’s murder determined that she was also sexually harassed and that leaders failed to take appropriate action.\n\nThe Atlantic did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.\n\nIn 2020,Goldberg reportedthat Trump referred to dead US troops as “suckers” and “losers” on the morning of a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France in 2018."
