        "source_1": "In the face of displacement, homelessness and hunger, Palestinian solidarity has remained unshakeable.\n\nFrom October 2023 to January 2025, Benjamin Netanyahu managed to displace about 1.9 million Palestinians – almost all of the population of Gaza. He must be proud. The Israeli prime minister can now go down in the Guinness Book of Records as the man who single-handedly displaced the most people within the smallest territory.\n\nI, myself, am one of these 1.9 million. I was displaced twice: the first time at the beginning of the genocidal war and then again a year later.\n\nMany Palestinian families were displaced repeatedly, some 10 times or more.\n\nIt was a clear strategy by Netanyahu to divide us. The north was cut off from the south. “Northerners” were forcibly expelled to the south. Then “southerners” and the other displaced were forced to move to the centre.\n\nBut this was not enough for him. The Israeli prime minister authorised a large-scale campaign to wipe out housing across the Gaza Strip, especially in the north and south. He also ordered the blocking of humanitarian aid to starve us.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 92 percent of homes in the Gaza Strip, or about 436,000 structures, were destroyed or damaged as a result of the Israeli aggression. According to Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, the Israeli army has not stopped demolishing homes in Rafah throughout the ceasefire.\n\nAccording to the World Food Programme, as of January, more than 2 million people were fully dependent on food assistance, and hundreds of thousands were facing “catastrophic levels of food insecurity”.\n\nNetanyahu has now ordered all humanitarian aid to be cut off again and is planning to forcibly expel Palestinians from the north to the south once again.\n\nHis aim is clear: to tear apart communities, to separate and weaken us, to turn us against each other through extreme deprivation. But his strategy failed in the past 16 months, and it will fail again.\n\nIn the face of a genocidal war, the people of Gaza showed immense solidarity with each other. Whoever had a home standing would open it to shelter the displaced, including their families, friends, neighbours and even strangers. Whoever had some food would also share.\n\nWhen we were under siege in our neighbourhood, Sheikh Radwan, in December 2023, we used to throw water bottles through the windows to our neighbour and his daughter to make sure they had something to drink. We also provided food to other people in need by throwing it over the wall separating our home from other homes.\n\nDuring our second displacement, a friend of my father’s opened his home for us in the south, and we remained there for four months.\n\nOn January 15 when the ceasefire was announced, the people of Gaza won against Netanyahu and his strategy of “divide and rule”. Four days later, some of the displaced from Rafah were able to go back.\n\nThen on January 27 came the “big return”. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians headed back to the north.\n\nFor the majority of the displaced, “return” meant discovering homelessness. People walked long distances on foot just to find their houses damaged or destroyed. The word we use to describe wrecked homes in Gaza right now is “biscuit” – a home smashed flat like a biscuit.\n\nThe homeless returnees had few options: to go to schools turned into shelters, to pitch a tent in open spaces or next to the rubble of their homes, or to try to repair any standing walls into a living space.\n\nFamilies are suffering in the heavy rain, strong wind and cold. Many, while cleaning, repairing or searching in the rubble to find their belongings, have found the bodies of loved ones and dug them out to bury them.\n\nBut even in the harsh reality of homelessness, Palestinians still find solidarity.\n\nPeople share what little they have of food, water and even space in overcrowded tents. Neighbours work together to repair broken walls and roofs. Some with half-damaged houses offer shelters to those in need. Volunteers initiate campaigns for distributing food and clothes to schools, shelters and tent camps.\n\nSome youth gather daily to cook in communal kitchens, ensuring no one is left hungry. People provide emotional support through WhatsApp groups and mental health meetings. At night, families gather to share stories and comfort each other to reduce the loneliness.\n\nThe men of our neighbourhood made a schedule to help each other in making shelters in damaged houses. They helped us put up tarps and secure them with poles to the ground and mend walls in our damaged home. We helped others by providing electricity to power the equipment through our barely functioning solar panel.\n\n“Home” is now what most people in Gaza long for. It is supposed to be a warm place of sweet memories you can escape to when the world becomes too much to bear. It is not supposed to be a tent, a school or a destroyed house.\n\nBut Palestinians have been here before. Three-quarters of the population of Gaza are refugees or descendants of refugees who lost their homes in the Nakba. My own ancestors were expelled from their homes in the town of al-Majdal.\n\nWhat Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders like him seem not to understand is that Gaza is not just a place for us, it is our home.\n\nHowever many times Israel cuts off aid and attacks, destroying homes and displacing people, we will rebuild, not by magic, but by our own solidarity, resilience and the world’s support.\n\nThe unity that has been passed from generation to generation has built a community that refuses to be erased. This is what will help Gaza rise again.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",
        "source_2": "The testing second stage of Gaza's ceasefire was always in doubt; now it seems to be dead at the moment it was meant to start.\n\nConcern is mounting that war will return to this ravaged territory, deepening the profound suffering of Palestinians and threatening the lives of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIsrael, backed by the United States, says there is a new deal now, after the agreement's first phase ended on Saturday. And it has halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza until Hamas accepts this new version too.\n\n\"A flagrant violation,\" was Cairo's strongly worded response. Egypt as well as Qatar, the two Arab mediators in this process along with the US, have also accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law by \"using  food as a weapon of war\".\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, 600 trucks carrying vital humanitarian aid are meant to enter Gaza daily - and huge numbers crossed through the 42 days of the first phase.\n\nThere has also been a loud chorus of criticism from other Arab states, as well as humanitarian leaders.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres, who has arrived in Cairo for Tuesday's emergency Arab summit on rebuilding Gaza, called for the \"immediate\" resumption of assistance. He urged \"all parties to make every effort to prevent a return to hostilities\".\n\nUnder the agreement, which came into effect on 19 January, this is the week when Israel should be pulling its troops from the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border and negotiations should intensify to end the war, return all the remaining hostages, and release more Palestinian prisoners in exchange.\n\nBut Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says US envoy Steve Witkoff has come up with a new plan.\n\nWitkoff has not yet announced his proposal, but Netanyahu said the first stage of the ceasefire would be extended for another 50 days, to cover the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover, and to continue negotiations.\n\nHamas, in exchange, would immediately release half of the remaining hostages, according to Netanyahu. Israel says 59 are still being held captive and \"up to 24\" are believed to be alive.\n\nOn Monday Hamas denounced this sudden shift as a \"a blatant attempt [by Israel] to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase\".\n\nThe group regards the hostages as its most important leverage and will make every effort to hold on to them until this current confrontation ends on terms it is willing to accept.\n\nA day earlier, Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty emphasised: \"There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January.\"\n\nIsraeli media have published reports of an Egyptian proposal for Hamas to release three living hostages and the remains of three others in exchange for a two-week extension of the ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from the Philadelphi corridor, as well as the main north-south Salah-al-Din road.\n\nBut an Arab diplomat with knowledge of the talks said they had not resumed yet in Cairo, although \"technical teams are in constant discussion\".\n\nThere was always going to be a dangerous standoff at this point.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu's primary aim has always been to \"destroy\" Hamas's military strength and political grip.\n\nTheir highly choreographed ceremonies and show of force during the hostage releases has angered Israelis and underlined that, while it has been significantly weakened, Hamas is still very much in charge in Gaza.\n\nArab diplomatic sources say that while Hamas has accepted it will not be involved in running Gaza once this war ends, it will not dismantle what is left of its sway.\n\nThat is unacceptable to Israel, and to its most important ally, the US.\n\nOn Sunday, the US National Security Council gave its full support for Israel's \"next step\". It put the blame firmly on Hamas, saying the group had \"indicated it's no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire\".\n\nIn a video address, Prime Minister Netanyahu described President Donald Trump as \"the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\".\n\nBut Israeli media say Washington is also putting pressure on the Israeli leader not to restart the fighting.\n\nThat kind of arm twisting is widely acknowledged to have pushed the ceasefire deal over the line even before the Trump team entered the White House on 20 January.\n\nPressure also mounts from Israelis increasingly anxious to see all the hostages come home.\n\nOn Sunday night, hundreds of protesters broke down police barriers outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem.\n\nThe US president, praised by his supporters as \"the world's best peacemaker\", could again shape the parameters of war or peace.\n\nIn the meantime, both sides are readying to resume the fight while they weigh their options for winning a peace on their terms.\n\nDefending the group's proscription under terror law, she said the organisation was \"not a non-violent organisation\".\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nIsrael says it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, accusing him of leading a Hamas cell, which Al Jazeera denies.\n\nIsrael said it targeted well known reporter Anas al-Sharif and alleged he was part of Hamas, which Al Jazeera has denied.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.",
        "source_3": "TEL AVIV—Israel halted any entry of goods into the Gaza Strip on Sunday, signaling the start of a more aggressive phase of its war to destroy Hamas.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision was a response to Hamas’s rejection of a proposal by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to extend the phase one hostage-ceasefire deal that expired a day earlier. Israel had endorsed the proposal.\n\n\"Upon the conclusion of the first stage, and in light of Hamas's rejection of the Witkoff framework, we decided at last night's discussion that as of this morning, the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza will be prevented,\" Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting on Sunday. \"If Hamas continues to stick to its position and does not release our hostages, there will be additional consequences, which I will not detail here.\"\n\nThe blockade of Gaza is one of a series of escalatory steps that Israel, backed by President Donald Trump, is prepared to take to bring home the hostages and end Hamas’s control of Gaza, according to several current and former Israeli officials with knowledge of high-level discussions. Israel anticipates that it will ultimately have to take full military control of Gaza and is developing plans to do so starting in several weeks, theWashington Free Beaconreportedon Thursday.\n\nThe sources said that Israeli decision-makers expect Hamas to resist disarmament or exile—Israel’s conditions for moving on to phase two of the deal, which would end the war—and instead to fight to the end while holding some of the hostages as human shields and bargaining chips.\n\nAmir Avivi, a former senior Israeli military official who has advised the government and military during the 17-month Gaza war, predicted that Israel’s next steps in Gaza would be heavy airstrikes, followed by ground incursions, and finally a \"decisive attack\" to conquer the strip.\n\n\"It’s very hard to see Hamas simply giving up without further military pressure,\" Avivi said. \"I think the understanding overall in the military and government leadership is that we are going to full-scale war.\"\n\nHezi Nehama, a former senior Israeli military official who served as a battalion commander in the war and has maintained close ties to the Israeli military’s Southern Command, told theFree Beacon,\"Everybody understands that in the end, we will have to fight and to defeat Hamas.\"\n\n\"And we understand that, unfortunately, some of the hostages—we won’t be able to bring them back,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu said Israel was \"not giving up on anyone\" among the 59 hostages who remain in Gaza, as many as 24 of them alive, and would \"immediately\" return to negotiations if Hamas accepted Witkoff’s proposal.\n\nIsraeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a statement on Sunday that Israel’s halt of humanitarian aid to Gaza was an \"important step\" toward opening \"the gates of hell\" on Gaza.\n\n\"Now we need to open these gates as quickly and fatally as possible to the cruel enemy, until complete victory,\"he added. \"We stayed in the government to ensure this, and so it will be in Gaza.\"\n\nIsrael’s Channel 12 reported on Saturday that Southern Command is on high alert and preparing for a return to fighting on short notice. In recent days, Israeli troops have been training to retake the strategically important Netzarim Corridor and other areas of Gaza from which the military withdrew during the ceasefire and for the possible relocation of the civilian population from the north of the strip to humanitarian zones in the south, according to the report.\n\nTwo Israeli military divisions have deployed to Israel’s buffer zone inside the borders of Gaza, including the Philadelphi Corridor in the south.\n\nOmer Dostri, a spokesman for Netanyahu,saidon X that no aid trucks had been allowed to enter Gaza as of Sunday morning, \"nor will they at this stage.\" Tzav 9, a grassroots activist group that seeks to block humanitarian aid to Gaza, confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the main crossings into Gaza had been closed to the trucks.\n\nHamas on Sunday called Israel’s halt to humanitarian aid \"a cheap act of extortion, a war crime, and a blatant violation of the agreement.\" Egypt, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, on Sunday accused Israel of using \"starvation as a weapon of war.\"\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Gideon Saar said at a Sunday press conference in Jerusalem that the starvation of Gazans has been \"a lie during this whole war,\" adding, \"We saw when our hostages were released, the terrorists and the crowd looked perfectly fine. The only ones that looked that they were starved were our hostages.\"\n\nThe surge of humanitarian aid that entered Gaza during the ceasefire will last four to six months, the current and former officials told theFree Beacon, echoing Israeli media reports. Meanwhile, water and electricity have continued flowing to Gaza, Israeli media reported.\n\nSaar also said that the Trump administration \"accepts our stance and recognizes it.\"\n\nAccording to Israel, Witkoff proposed a 50-day extension of the first phase of the ceasefire to allow more time for deadlocked negotiations over a potential phase two, which would end the war. Under the plan, Israel said, Hamas would release half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza on the first day of the extension and the rest on the final day if a second phase were agreed upon.\n\nTheFree Beaconpreviously reported that incoming Israeli military chief of staff Eyal Zamir, at the direction of Netanyahu and defense minister Israel Katz, has started developing the plan to return to war in Gaza. Initial steps include a cutoff of aid to Gaza, relocation of Gazan civilians to humanitarian zones in the south of the strip, and airstrikes on Hamas targets. The plan then calls for four or five divisions to conquer Gaza in six months or less.\n\nPublished under:Donald Trump,Egypt,Gaza,Hamas,IDF,Israel,Netanyahu,Steve Witkoff,Tel Aviv"
