        "source_1": "President-elect Donald Trump repeated numerous false claims during an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” – including his old lie that the US is the world’s only country with birthright citizenship.\n\nTrump reiterated his intention to try to end birthright citizenship, in which, under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, someone born in the US is granted automatic citizenship even if their parents are not citizens. And he asserted, “We’re the only country that has it.”\n\nThis is not true; CNN andvarious other outletspreviously debunked the claim when Trump made it during his presidential campaign in 2015 andduring his first presidency in 2018.About three dozen countriesprovide automatic citizenship to people born on their soil, including US neighbors Canada and Mexico and the majority of South American countries.\n\nHere are some other false and misleading claims Trump made in the portion of the interview that NBC aired on television on Sunday morning. (CNN has not yet reviewed the additional chunks of the interview that NBC released online.)\n\nCrime: Trump falsely claimed, “Crime is at an all-time high.” That is nowhere close to true. Both violent crime and property crime rateshave plummeted in the US since the early 1990sand are far below all-time highs. FBI data shows that crimedeclined again in 2023.\n\nTrump’s tariffs: Trump falsely claimed of the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency: “They cost Americans nothing.”Studyafterstudy, includingone from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission,foundthat Americans bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. The tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters as Trump regularly claims, and it’s easy to findspecific examplesof companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nRelated live storyThe latest on Trump’s presidential transition\n\nTrump and inflation: Trump falsely claimed that, during his presidency, “We had no inflation.” In fact, cumulative inflation during Trump’s presidencywas about 8%.\n\nBiden and inflation:Trump falsely claimed that inflation was so low during his presidency that the Biden administration “didn’t have inflation for a year and a half – they went almost two years, just based on what I had created.” In reality, there wascumulative inflation of about 14%over Joe Biden’sfirst two years as president; the Biden-era peak for month-over-month inflation, 9.1%,occurred in June 2022, during those first two years.\n\nThe 2020 election: Trump vaguely reiterated his lie that he was the real winner of the 2020 election, saying, “I think it’s an easy argument, it was really proven even more conclusively by the win that I had on this one.” His legitimate victory in the 2024 election does not do anything to validate his claims that the 2020 election was stolen,\n\nMigrants and murderers: Trump repeated his frequent false claim there were “13,099 murderers released into our country over the last three years.” In reality, asthe Department of Homeland Security and independent experts have noted, that official figure is about immigrants with homicide convictions in the US today who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s own administration, not over the past three years or solely under the Biden administration.

Trump has never corroborated this claim, and experts have toldCNN,PolitiFactandFactCheck.orgthat they haven’t seen any evidence that it is true.\n\nThe European Union and trade: Trump repeated a false claim he has repeatedly made about European countries and trade: “They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our food product, they don’t take anything.”\n\nThe USexported about $368 billionin goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), US federal figures show. According to a December 2023reportfrom the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports — importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehiclesmade by European automakers at plants in the US.) And the US governmentsaysthe EU was the fifth-largest 2022 export market for US agricultural and related products, behind China, Canada, Mexico and Japan.\n\nTrump and Obamacare: Trump claimed, “I am the one that saved Obamacare.” This is misleading at best.As president, Trump tried to repeal Obamacare but failed because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. After that, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the law, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges – and theyrefused to defendseveral central provisions of the law in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, instead arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-electDonald Trumpwas fact checked over his migration statistics while onMeet The Pressthis weekend, and it turns out there has been a mix-up over the numbers of migrant murderers entering the U.S.\n\nSpeaking withKristen Welkeron December 8 Trump said: \"So we had 11,000, and 13,000, there are different estimates. 13,099 murderers released into our country in the last three years.\n\n\"They're walking down the streets. They're walking next to you, and your family.\"\n\nTo which Welker responded: \"The 13,000 figure I think goes back about 40 years.\"\n\nTrump then said, \"No, it doesn't,\" stating that the Border Patrol put out these figures for the Biden Administration.\n\nThe numbers stem from aletterreleased in 2024 by theDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS) which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and it revealed that there are 13,099 \"noncitizens\" convicted of homicide living within the U.S. this year.\n\nBut a DHS official told theBBCin October that the figures had been misinterpreted by politicians. They said: \"It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners,\" meaning these people are not just roaming the streets, as suggested by Trump.\n\nDHS added: \"The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this [Biden-Harris] administration.\"\n\nThe Trump transition team has been contacted for comment.\n\nA similar data release was published at the end of the Trump administration, showing that there were 405,786 noncitizens who were convicted criminals living within the country. Like the data that Trump was referring to with Welker, these numbers were collected over time.\n\nTrump spoke more on immigration with Welker,doubling down on his plan to end birthright citizenshipfor the children of undocumented migrants.\n\nTrump said: \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\" He went on to say he would do it via executive action.\n\nThe President-elect then said that the United States is the only country that has birthright citizenship, although 30 other countries including the U.K, Canada, Belgium Ireland, Israel, and South Africa all give automatic citizenship to people who are born in their country.\n\nTrump also echoed his new Border Czar,Tom Homan's, policy proposal around family deportation, telling Welker: \"The only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"\n\nHoman had previously made light of suggestionsthat he would be deporting families together, but did not refute entirely that he would be deporting families of undocumented migrants.\n\nFollowing this interview, it is clear that mass family deportations are on the cards for the Trump Administration.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

And yet I got more votes than any Republican candidate in history by far.”\n\n“The press has to straighten itself out, because honestly it’s lost all credibility,” he continued. “Based on the press I should’ve gotten no votes, none. And yet I got the highest number ever.”\n\nHe then laid into Welker, “And the reason is because I’m able to go on a show even like yours, even though you’re very hostile, I’m able to go on a show like yours [Welker laughs] — no, you are.”\n\n“It’s fair only in that you allowed me to say what I say,” he added. “But you know the answers, the questions are, you know, pretty nasty.”\n\nTrump rips NBC News’ Kristen Welker for being a “hostile” and “nasty” interviewer:\n\n“The press has to straighten itself out, because honestly it’s lost all credibility.
