        "source_1": "Pakistan has formally recommended US PresidentDonald Trumpfor the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his “decisive diplomatic intervention” following a spike in violence between India and Pakistan earlierthis year.\n\nThe government praised Trump for leveraging his “pivotal leadership” in May, when several days of cross-border strikes marked the worst regional fighting between the two nuclear-armed nations since 1971, killing dozens and stoking fears of a wider war.\n\nIslamabad and New Delhi agreed to a US-brokered truce on May 8, as one final burst of strikes ripped through parts of the long-disputed Kashmir region – to which both countries claim full sovereignty.\n\n“At a moment of heightened regional turbulence, President Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi,” Pakistan’s government said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe US president helped in “averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond” the statement added.\n\n“This intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue.”\n\nIndian and Pakistani officials gavecontradictory accountsof how the agreement on a truce was reached at the time. While Islamabad lauded the involvement of the White House, New Delhi downplayed it – keen to relay the ceasefire as a victory and saying the neighbors “directly” collaborated on the truce.\n\nGovernments, other institutions and certain individuals cannominateany living person or active organization for the Nobel Peace Prize. The winner is decided each year by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nRelated article‘Always a peacemaker’: How Trump decided to hold off on striking Iran\n\nTrump has long sought to present himself as a global peacemaker.\n\nBefore his second term in office, the Republican leader ferociously criticized his predecessor President Joe Biden’s failed attempts to negotiate an end to Israel’s brutal campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine the year prior.\n\nNow, a new waris brewingin the Middle East after Israel unleashed mass strikes on Iran on June 13, prompting retaliatory attacks from Tehran – a week-long conflict that has already inflicted a bitter human cost.\n\nMore than 400 people have been killed in Iran, Iranian state broadcaster IRIB reported on Saturday, citing Iran’s health ministry. In Israel, at least 24 people have been killed, according to the Israeli government.\n\nIsrael says the attacks are targeting nuclear sites and high-ranking military officers, several of whom have been killed. Tehran has retaliated with drone and missile attacks deep into northern and southern Israel.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump set out aself-imposed two-week timelinefor a decision on US military involvement in Iran. After meeting with a top EU official and foreign ministers from Britain, France and Germany in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister said his country would not re-enter negotiations with the US while it remains under attack from Israel.\n\nJust on Friday, Trump sought to stress his diplomatic successes in the Middle East and beyond, while suggesting he would not gain recognition for them.\n\n“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan,” he posted on hisTruth Social platform.\n\n“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be.”",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPakistan has announced its nomination of PresidentDonald Trumpfor the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting him with averting a major conflict in South Asia at a time when the U.S. leader is contemplating intervention in the Middle East.\n\n\"The Government of Pakistan has decided to formally recommend President Donald J. Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis,\" the Pakistani government's official X, formerlyTwitter, account wrote in a post Friday.\n\nThe nomination comes just two days after Trump met with Pakistani Army Chief of Staff Field Marshall Asim Munir at the White House.\n\nIn addition to the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan, sparked by a deadly Islamist militant attack in India-administered Kashmir, one of the items discussed by the two men on Wednesday was the deepening conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe two longtime foes have traded direct strikes against one another since Israel launched a massive series of attacks against Iran last week, alleging that Tehran was secretly moving toward producing a nuclear weapon, a claim denied by Iranian officials. Pakistan, which neighbors Iran, has repeatedly condemned Israel over its operations.\n\nYet Trump, whose administration had entered into talks with Iran aimed at reaching an agreement on the country's nuclear program, has backed the Israeli offensive and has openly contemplated joining the Israeli campaign through strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nA statement released Thursday by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, a day after Trump's meeting with Munir, indicated that Trump was still holding out for a potential diplomatic breakthrough.\n\n\"Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\" Trump said, according to Leavitt.\n\nReached for comment byNewsweek, the Pakistani Mission to theUnited Nationsexpressed hope that Trump would once again oversee a peaceful resolution.\n\n\"As stated by us in the Security Council, Pakistan favours a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy,\" the Pakistani Mission said. \"We hope that the situation will not escalate militarily, and tensions will be diffused amicably through diplomatic engagement.\"\n\n\"President Trump has distinguished himself as a peacemaker,\" the Mission added. \"His statesmanship and successful diplomatic intervention with Pakistan and India played a crucial role in bringing about a ceasefire between the two countries in May 2025.\"\n\nThe Mission stated, \"we remain hopeful that his earnest efforts will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability, particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating escalation involving Iran.\"\n\nNewsweekhas reached out to the White House for comment via email Friday.\n\nIran and Pakistan have a complex relationship, marked by both a long history of cooperation as well as tensions on key issues. Both nations are officially styled as Islamic republics, though Iran is predominantly Shiite Muslim, while Pakistan is predominantly Sunni Muslim.\n\nTheir relations date back to Pakistan's founding amid the United Kingdom's partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, with Iran being the second nation after the U.K. to recognize Pakistan's independence. Pakistan was among the earliest countries to establish new diplomatic ties with Iran following its 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted pro-Western monarchy and put in place the country's current theocratic system.\n\nPakistan is also suspected to have played a role in aiding Iran's nuclear efforts, dating back at least to the 1980s via nuclear physicist Abdul Qadeer Khan, considered to be the chief architect of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Khan, who died in October 2021, drew controversy in 2004 after he admitted to transferring nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya, though he claimed he did so without the knowledge of the Pakistani government.\n\nWhile Iranian officials have never officially acknowledged receiving components related to their country's nuclear program from Khan specifically, reports issued by theCIA, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other agencies have drawn connections between the two nation's nuclear prowess.\n\nIslamabad and Tehran also have established mechanisms ofsecurity cooperation, especially aimed at battling an array of militant groups, including Baloch separatist groups, that operate on both sides of their shared border.\n\nYet mutual distrust has at times prevailed, with both sides occasionally accusing one another of failing to uphold their side of security commitments.\n\nThistension boiled overin January 2024 when Iran, having suffered the worst militant attack in its history perpetrated by the Islamic State militant group (ISIS), conducted surprise missile strikes against alleged positions tied to Baloch Islamist militant group Jaish ul-Adl in Pakistan's Balochistan province, as well as separate strikes against insurgents in Syria and an alleged Israeli spy base in northern Iraq.\n\nPakistan reacted with fury to the strikes and conducted retaliatory air and artillery strikes against positions tied to the Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front separatist groups in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan province. Officials from both sides quickly agreed to de-escalate after the clash.\n\nThe Iran-Pakistan flare-up occurred as Tehran became increasingly embroiled in a separate conflict between Israel and the Palestinian IslamistHamasmovement. After Hamas conducted a surprise attack against Israel in October 2023, the group was backed in the ensuing war with Israel by Iran and its Axis of Resistance coalition of non-state actors in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe Axis of Resistance also counts allies from Pakistan, namely the Zainebiyoun Brigade, which consists of Shiite Muslim fighters predominantly involved in the fight against ISIS in Syria.\n\nPakistan, the world's onlyMuslim nuclear weapons power, has repeatedly condemned Israel, with which Islamabad has never established diplomatic ties, over its campaigns in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Israel is alsowidely believedto have nuclear weapons.\n\nPakistani calls for de-escalation have ramped up since Israel's direct attacks on Iran. On Tuesday, Pakistan joined 19 other Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, in voicing a \"categorical rejection\" of Israel's aerial offensive against Iran and calling for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Israeli strikes have largely targeted sites and personnel tied to Iran's armed forces and nuclear facilities, though activists report a mounting civilian death toll. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claim to have largely destroyed Iran's air defense network and to have made strides in depleting the country's missile capabilities, even as Iranian strikes continue to hit Israel.\n\nAs of Thursday, however, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said that Iran has not \"asked us for any kind of military assistance so far.\"\n\n\"Pakistan's position on Iran is clear and transparent,\" Khan told reporters. \"We provide full moral support to Iran; we strongly condemn the aggression against Iran.\"\n\nPakistan's nomination of Trump serves as further evidence of potential warming of ties between Islamabad and Washington under the current administration, and at a potentially critical moment.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed interest in receiving a Nobel Peace Prize over the years, including in relation to his first administration's efforts to reach a nuclear deal with North Korea and his role in overseeing the 2020 Abraham Accords through which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco normalized ties with Israel.\n\nWhen Trump delivered the first address of his second administration to a joint session ofCongressin March, he credited Pakistan with helping the U.S. capture the suspected mastermind of a deadly attack conducted by ISIS against U.S. troops and Afghan civilians amid the U.S. withdrawal of Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nTrump is also known for seeking a stronger relationship with India, having empowered the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue coalition between the countries as well as Australia and Japan during his first administration. Trump has met with Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modithree times throughout his two terms, most recently in February.\n\nVice PresidentJD Vancealso happened to be visiting India when Islamist militants killed 27 people in the town of Pahalgam, setting off the most serious India-Pakistan crisis in years.\n\nAmid the tensions, however, Trump appeared to leverage his ties with both sides in order to intervene diplomatically. The extent of his role remains disputed by Modi, who told Trump that India was not interested in third-party mediation over the Kashmir dispute during their call Tuesday, according to Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.\n\nModi told reporters Friday that he \"politely declined\" an offer from Trump to meet at the White House this past week, citing a preexisting commitment.\n\nSpeaking Friday in New Jersey, Trump spoke optimistically about the potential to strike trade deals with India and Pakistan and hailed his efforts to promote peace between the rivals and mediate on other conflicts, including between Iran and Israel.\n\n\"As you know, we did a very great job with India and Pakistan,\" Trump said. \"And we had India in, it looks like we're going to be making a trade deal with India, and we had Pakistan in, it looks like we're going to be making a trade deal with Pakistan. And it's a beautiful thing to watch.\"\n\n\"Serbia, Kosovo, likewise, they've been fighting for years, and as you know, we brought that one to a conclusion,\" he added. \"And now we have a couple of big ones, we have Russia-Ukraine, we're making a little bit of progress, and we have Israel. And nobody really knows what that one is all about. We're going to find out pretty soon, I guess.\"\n\nCorrection: The headline has been updated to reflect Pakistan nominated Trump, not Iran as a previous version read.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBased in his hometown of Staten Island, New York City, Tom O'Connor is an award-winning Senior Writer of Foreign Policy and Deputy Editor of National Security and Foreign Policy at Newsweek, where he specializes in covering the Middle East, North Korea, China, Russia and other areas of international affairs, relations and conflict.
