Following the recent epic clash of two storied franchises, Dodgers fans are still celebrating, while Yankees fans are misty-eyed about what might have been. As for me, I’m a diehard Giants fan, and I’m already excited about next season … looking at you, Buster Posey!\n\nThe beauty of baseball, America’s pastime, is that there’s always next season.\n\nAnd this week? America’s “world series” of politics comes to a head. After demanding our attention, ingesting our donations, soliciting our votes, and triggering our passions for months on end, Team Democrat and Team Republican will face off in “the most consequential election of our lifetimes.”\n\nDespite the confident assertions of countless prognosticators, none of us knows yet whether we will soon be celebrating like Dodgers fans or mourning like Yankees fans. Crazy.\n\nWill the days ahead have more of a “storm the battlements” vibe, or more of a “get up and go to work” vibe? Incredibly, and depressingly, even this is uncertain.\n\n(For a fun, reassuring take on why we’re probablynotheading for civil war, watchthis short TikTok video.)\n\nAll of these uncertainties are disquieting. They create voids into which we collectively pour our anxieties, suspicions, grievances, and worst-case scenarios.\n\nOur relationships, communities, and country -- already frayed and fragile -- strain further as we use imperfect math to calculate the risks of choosing badly, of not knowing for too long, of turning against each other in the process.\n\nBut in the days ahead, inch by inch, win or lose, we will gradually be relieved of these uncertainties as ballots are grindingly counted, results are called, skirmishes are settled, and America’s next political season comes into view.\n\nNow that’s a great question. Here atCivic Health Project, we’re feeling impatient to get through this election and energized to jumpstart critical work on the other side.\n\nLet’s face it, no matter who wins in this election cycle, they aren’t going to solve all our problems. Like it or not,we the peoplehave a lot of work to do.\n\nAcross our towns, schools, workplaces, churches, clubs, councils, across all the beautiful tapestry of our civic life,we the peoplemust address America’s yearning needs for cultural reconciliation, democracy renovation, and societal innovation.\n\nAcross our formal institutions -- the civilian, military, economic, academic, and other entities that shape American civic life at the highest levels --we the peoplemust choose to renovate and renew, rather than disparage and dismantle, these intersecting pillars of American strength.\n\nAcross our media, social media, and entertainment channels,we the peoplemust signal with our preferences that we crave narratives of solution and connection, and we reject narratives of cynicism and division.\n\nAcross the chasm of this turbulent election, all of this work waits for us.\n\n(VisitConversation.usto find out how Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs are lowering the heat and finding a way forward together.)\n\nSo yes, this week, let’s prepare to celebrate like Dodgers fans or mourn like Yankees fans.\n\nThen, as quickly as we can, let’s find in ourselves and each other the grace, respect, humility, curiosity, and hope to engage together in our ongoing work of civic repair and renewal.\n\nWe, the people, are democracy. Let’s get to work. Let’s build.",

Each day, I wake up excited—not because I’m naturally an upbeat person, but because I know there’s a new episode ofThe DailyfromThe New York Timeswaiting for me to listen to. I recently put on a new episode and was not happy to hear the hosts describing the inevitability of “outbreaks of political violence” if Donald Trump loses on November 5th. I understand how some people have arrived at this conclusion. But I also don’t accept that conclusion, and the rest of us shouldn’t either.\n\nI joined BridgeUSA as a freshman in college. Joe Biden had taken office just a few months prior and the investigations into the capitol riot on January 6th had just gotten into full swing. At my BridgeUSA chapter in Florida, it was the main topic of interest. Indeed, it was a terrible day, as was the day after the 2016 election when millions of dollars’ worth of damage was the result of anti-Trump sentiment. We’ve gotten used to the anger and bitterness in the leadup to our national elections. What’s much worse is that it feels like we are now starting to get used to violence and fear.\n\nBut one place I have never been fearful and never seen violence break out is a BridgeUSA meeting. That’s because we know the game won’t be zero sum before the conversation starts; All of us come to the table ready to have our viewpoints challenged and confident that they will be challenged without malice.\n\nFor many people who haven’t experienced this exchange of ideas, however, I get how political violence feels unavoidable (I’ll remind you, the hosts used the word “inevitable”). Because our news outlets often amplify sensational stories and many of our politicians use divisive rhetoric. But here’s the thing: I believe that violence is only as inevitable as we allow it to be. The choice is ours, and we can choose peaceful, constructive dialogue. If we make the effort to have hard conversations like my peers at BridgeUSA—by sitting across from those we disagree with and listening—we could return to a time when political frustration didn’t manifest as dangerous behaviors.\n\nWe can begin by being examples. When people see others engaging in respectful, thoughtful political conversations, it reinforces the idea that this is not only possible but preferable. Each of us has the power to influence those around us and, in turn, influence the larger narrative about how we handle our differences. Instead, let’s set the standard for what our democracy looks like—an environment where every voice can be heard without fear and where disagreements can strengthen rather than divide us. If we start in our communities, in our conversations, and in ourselves, we can build a nation where, regardless of who wins, we all leave with our dignity and unity intact and our windows unbroken.\n\nHere’s something that some analysts and prognosticators may have missed in their editorializing: We live in a great country with good people. And these good people want to get along with each other. After this election, let’s help each other to do that.\n\nCopyright © 2025 BridgeUSA.  All Rights Reserved. Registered 501(c)(3).
