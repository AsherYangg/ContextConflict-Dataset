He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.Enjoy the podcastpic.twitter.com/LdBxZFVsLN\n\n“He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” Rogan said in apost on X, the social media site Musk purchased in 2022.\n\n“For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump,” he added.\n\nRogan did not endorse the former president during the interview with Musk, but spoke glowingly of the Republican nominee with the SpaceX CEO.\n\nTrump sat down for aninterview with Roganon Oct. 25. His vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, alsowent on the podcastlast week.\n\nRogantried to book an interviewwith Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but the vice president’s campaign was reluctant to sit down with the podcaster for his typical interview length, which can sometimes run as long as three hours at his Austin, Texas, studio.\n\nThe former president almost immediately addressed the endorsement at his rally in Pennsylvania alongside former Fox News hostMegyn Kelly, thanking the podcast host and complimenting his reach.\n\n“I have some more big news, Megyn, I’m just getting this right now,” Trump told the crowd in Pittsburgh. “So somebody that’s very, very respected asked me to do his show two weeks ago, and I said, ‘Why not?’ And to me it’s very big because he’s the biggest there is I guess, in that world by far, somebody said ‘the biggest beyond anybody in a long time’ and his name is Joe Rogan and he’s never done this before. Thank you Joe. That’s so nice. And he doesn’t do that.”\n\n“He tends to be a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room,” Trump told the crowd of supporters. “I had a lot of fun, he was amazing.”\n\nRogan previously expressed some admiration for the Democratic nominee and even praised her campaign strategy.\n\n“They did an amazing job from the moment Biden drops out, forcing Biden to drop out,”Rogan saidin a September podcast episode after the presidential debate. “Whatever they’re doing, whoever’s writing those speeches, getting her to deliver them, coaching her—she’s nailing it.”\n\nRogan’s podcast is the most popular podcast on Spotify’sPodcast Charts, and video feeds of his interviews regularly get millions of views on YouTube. However, Rogan has alsodrawn criticismin the past for voicing support forconspiracy theories.",
        "source_2": "Joe Rogan has given his endorsement to Donald Trump as Americans head to the polls in Tuesday's presidential election.\n\nThe podcaster said he was giving the Republican his backing after being convinced in one of his interviews by tech billionaire Elon Musk, another high-profile supporter of Trump.\n\nRogan's backing could carry significant weight with his young, male listenership - which is also a demographic that Trump has been working hard to court ahead of the 2024 vote. Trump welcomed the endorsement as \"great\" news.\n\nTrump's rival, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, has received endorsements from numerous other top celebrities, including musicians Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.\n\nAhead of polling day, Tuesday, both campaigns have been working to win over undecided voters in an extremely close race.\n\nRogan's endorsement could reach a wide audience, since he enjoys more than 18 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 14 million followers on Spotify.\n\nTrump himself appeared on the podcast last month -  speaking about topics from the \"biggest mistake\" of his time in the White House to whether alien life exists. Harris, too, has featured on podcasts during her campaign - but to a lesser extent.\n\nAlmost 80% of Rogan's audience are men, while half are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to the firm Edison Research. Trump's 2024 campaign has focused on podcasts popular with younger men over traditional media outlets.\n\nThe race has been characterised by pundits as a story of men v women - with Donald Trump enjoying a huge polling lead among men, and women telling pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin.\n\nKaty Perry and Lady Gaga were among the stars who lent their support to Harris on the eve of the election. And at a rally in swing state Pennsylvania, TV host Oprah Winfrey issued an appeal to voters to protect women's reproductive rights.\n\nMeanwhile, explaining his endorsement for Trump, Rogan wrote that Mr Musk \"makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way\".\n\nWriting on X to introduce his interview with Musk, Rogan praised \"the great and powerful\" Mr Musk himself. Tesla founder Mr Musk has appeared at recent Trump rallies and has been giving away prizes of $1m (£770,000) a day to registered voters in battleground states.\n\nTrump, who has previously suggested he could reward Elon Musk with a job if he wins the vote, said at a rally that Rogan's backing was \"great\" and \"so nice\".\n\nThe endorsement appears to mark a significant shift in politics for Rogan. He once said he would \"probably\" vote for Sen Bernie Sanders - a progressive who previously competed for the Democratic presidential nomination himself.\n\nAs recently as 2022, the podcaster said he did not want to \"help\" Trump electorally because he was \"an existential threat to democracy\". He previously lent his support to Robert F Kennedy Jr, then running as an independent presidential candidate.\n\nRogan, who ventured into podcasting after a career as a stand-up comedian, is known for hosting an ideologically diverse mix of guests.\n\nOccasionally, this editorial approach has landed him in controversy - for example during the Covid pandemic, when he was accused of spreading vaccine misinformation.\n\nThe BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques.\n\nThe former US president says he has no regrets over his late withdrawal in the contest against Donald Trump.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe accused says his attorneys were not answering his questions and that they were \"a million miles apart\".\n\nJoe Biden's son directs expletive-filled accusations at the Hollywood actor for his part in the former president quitting the campaign.\n\nThe BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe former US president says he has no regrets over his late withdrawal in the contest against Donald Trump.",
        "source_3": "Joe Rogan revealed on the eve of Election Day that he’s backing Donald Trump for president — less than two weeks after interviewing the ex-commander-in-chief on his wildly popular podcast.\n\nThe podcasterannounced the endorsement on Xwhile promoting his Monday interview with Elon Musk on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\n“If it wasn’t for him, we’d be f–ked,” Rogan said of Musk. “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.”\n\n“For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump,” Rogan wrote.\n\nThe nonchalant endorsement comes after the podcast hostinterviewed the former presidentin an Oct. 25 episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which has an estimated 14.5 million Spotify followers.\n\nTrump suggested Rogan, 57, should back his presidential campaign during the nearly three-hour sit-down.\n\n“He gave me the nicest endorsement,” Trump had said, referring to Musk, who endorsed the 45th president shortly after he was nearly assassinated at his Butler, Pa., rally in July.\n\n“You should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala. Kamala. You’re not a Kamala person. I know you,” Trump told the podcaster.\n\nRogan in 2022 said he was “not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form,” but finally gave the Republican his support with less than 24 hours before Election Day.\n\nIn his new interview with Musk published Monday, the podcaster admitted that Trump isn’t a “perfect” choice.\n\n“[The Democrats] have done such a job of painting Trump as a monster, you know, they’ve taken the worst things that he’s ever said and [amplified them] and he’s not a perfect person,” Rogan said. “But guess what? No one’s perfect. They don’t exist.”\n\nBut Rogan appeared to make the case that Trump was the better option when compared to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“There’s this other narrative that drives me crazy is that [Trump] is going to destroy democracy,” Rogan said before flipping the script. “So in order to destroy democracy, we have to install a president without a primary, we have to have a candidate that is the least liked vice president of all time — the least popular vice president of all time — and then use gaslighting and the full force of the media machine to turn her into the future and hope and she’s going to be change even though she’s the sitting vice president.”\n\nTrump, 78, learned of Rogan’s endorsement at his Pittsburg, Pa., rally Monday night and shared the news with rally-goers.\n\n“I have some more big news now. I’m just getting this right now,” the Republican nominee told his crowd of supporters. “So somebody that’s very, very respected asked me to do his show two weeks ago, and I said, ‘Why not?'”\n\n“And to me, it’s very big because he’s the biggest there is, I guess, in that world by far … And his name is Joe Rogan and he’s never done this before. And it just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me,” Trump said.\n\n“That’s so nice. And he doesn’t do that,” he added. “He’s not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So I just want to say, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk and Megyn [Kelly], thank you very much.”\n\nRoganpreviously endorsedliberal Democrat Bernie Sanders in 2020.\n\nDuring the current election cycle, he said he was “a fan” of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before the independent candidate dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.\n\n“He’s the only one that makes sense to me. He doesn’t attack people. He attacks actions and ideas. He’s much more reasonable and intelligent,” Rogan had said of RFK Jr.\n\nHe later clarified that his statements of supportweren’t an official endorsementafter drawing the ire of Trump supporters and Trump himself.\n\n“I’m not the guy to get political information from,” Rogan had said.\n\nRogan’s interview with the Republican nominee has racked up more than 45 million views on YouTube as of late Monday.\n\nRogan’s podcast, which routinely claims the number one spot on Spotify’s top podcasts chart, has an overwhelmingly male audience."
