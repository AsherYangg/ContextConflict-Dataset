        "source_1": "The Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it act to improve thehumanitarian situation in Gazawithin the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.\n\nThe Sunday letter, jointly written by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin,  is addressed to Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. It marks a significant new step by the US to try to compel Israel to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nThey write that the US has deep concerns about the situation and ask for “urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.”\n\nSince this Spring, the amount of aid delivered to Gaza has dropped more than 50% and the quantity delivered in September “was the lowest of any month during the past year,” they added.\n\nThe deadline falls after the USpresidential electionon November 5.\n\nDespite the stern warning, however, the US has continued to provide military assistance to Israel. In May, President Joe Biden threatened to cut off bombs and artillery to Israel if it launched a major invasion of Rafah. Israel did, however, launch an invasion into Rafah and the Biden administration still announced a $1 Billion weapon package to Israel shortly after. Earlier this week, the US sent an advanced air defense system and US troops to Israel amid heightend tensions in the region.\n\nFuture US aid could be at risk, however. The letter, dated October 13, notes that the US State and Defense departments, under US law, “must continually assess” Israel’s adherence to its assurances made earlier this year that it would not restrict aid flows into the enclave.\n\nA US defense official said that the administration hopes the letter will convince the Israelis to act. “Secretary Blinken sent a similar letter in April, which received a constructive response and concrete measures from the Israelis,” the official said. “ This letter follows a recent decrease in assistance reaching Gaza, which we aim to similarly address with concrete measures.”\n\nThe US’ list of demands is extensive. Israel must allow at least 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through all four major crossings, the letter says, in addition to opening a fifth crossing. Israel must also over the next month implement humanitarian pauses across Gaza as necessary to enable humanitarian activities, including vaccinations and aid distribution for at least the next four months.\n\nThe US is also demanding that Israel allow people in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone inside Gaza to move inland before winter and enhance security for humanitarian convoys and movements.\n\nIsrael must also take action to ensure that the Jordan Armed forces corridors are functioning at “full and continuous capacity.”\n\nThe letter closes by calling for a new channel between the US and Israeli governments to “raise and discuss civilian harm incidents,” with the first meeting to be held at the end of the month.\n\nIsrael’s military operations in northern Gaza have intensified in recent weeks, and the Israeli military has called on civilians there to evacuate to the south, where more than one million displaced Palestinians are already sheltering. The UN World Food Programme warned last weekend that Israeli military operations are having a “disastrous impact” on food security for Palestinian families.\n\nBlinken and Austin wrote that the Israeli government’s actions appear to be contributing to the worsening humanitarian situation.\n\n“We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government – including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments – together with increased lawlessness and looting – are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,” they said.\n\nIsrael appears to already be responding to the letter, at least indirectly. Just one day after the letter was sent, COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, tweeted photos of aid going into Gaza.\n\n“30 trucks entered northern Gaza through the Erez Crossing earlier today. Israel is not preventing the entry of humanitarian aid, with an emphasis on food, into Gaza,” COGAT said in a post on X. “Israel will continue to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza, while simultaneously destroying Hamas’ military and governance infrastructures.”\n\nThis story is has been updated with additional details.",
        "source_2": "The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off.\n\nThe letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties.\n\nIt says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month.\n\nIsrael is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country \"takes this matter seriously\" and intends to \"address the concerns raised\" with US counterparts.\n\nIsrael has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said 30 lorries carrying aid from the World Food Programme had entered northern Gaza through the Erez crossing.\n\nThat ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there.\n\nA UN official has said that Gaza is in a state of \"constant peak emergency\".\n\nAntoine Renard, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in the occupied Palestinian territories, told the AFP news agency people in the north of the territory were \"relying solely on assistance\" with practically no access to fresh food other than that provided by UN agencies.\n\nThe US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, and the Israeli military has relied heavily on US-supplied aircraft, guided bombs, missiles and shells to fight the war against Hamas in Gaza over the past year.\n\nThe US letter to the Israeli government - the contents of which have now been confirmed by the state department - was first reported by the Axios website. It is signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\n\"We are now writing to underscore the US government’s deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,\" it says.\n\nIt states that Israeli evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into the narrow, coastal al-Mawasi area where they are at “high risk of lethal contagion” due to extreme overcrowding, and that humanitarian organisations report that their survival needs cannot be met.\n\n\"We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments - together with increased lawlessness and looting - are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,\" it adds.\n\nThe letter says Israel \"must, starting now and within 30 days\" act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, adding that failure may “have implications for US policy”.\n\nIt cites US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid.\n\nIt says Israel must \"surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza\" before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing people in al-Mawasi to move inland.\n\nIt also calls on Israel to end the \"isolation of northern Gaza\" by reaffirming that there will be \"no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians\" from north to south.\n\nAt a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the letter was \"a private diplomatic communication that we did not intend to make public\".\n\n\"Secretary [Blinken] along with Secretary Austin thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes they need to make again to see the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up,\" he said.\n\nMr Miller declined to speculate on what consequences there might be for Israel if it did not boost humanitarian aid access.\n\nBut he noted: \"Recipients of US military assistance do not arbitrarily deny or impede provisioning of US humanitarian assistance. That’s just the law and we of course will follow the law. But our hope is that Israel will make the changes that we have outlined.\"\n\nHe also said the 30-day time limit was not linked to the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November, saying it was \"appropriate to give them time to work through the different issues\".\n\nIsrael has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid or humanitarian assistance that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and blames UN agencies for failing to distribute supplies. It also accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies.\n\nBefore Israel’s ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, President Joe Biden suspended a single consignment of 2,000 and 500lb bombs for the first time as he tried to dissuade it from an all-out assault.\n\nBut the president immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appeared to compare it to an \"arms embargo\". The suspension was partially lifted in July and has not been repeated.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that families in northern Gaza were \"facing unimaginable fear, loss of loved ones, confusion, and exhaustion\" because of the Israeli offensive that began 10 days ago.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has sent tanks and troops back into the town of Jabalia and its urban refugee camp for a third time to root out Hamas fighters who have regrouped there.\n\nIt has ordered residents of Jabalia, as well as neighbouring Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, to evacuate to the al-Mawasi \"humanitarian area\".\n\nThe UN says about 50,000 people have fled to Gaza City and other parts of the north. But for many it is unsafe to leave their homes or they are unable to leave because they are sick or disabled.\n\nKhalid,a resident of Jabalia whose accounts of the past year are featured in a new BBC documentary, said in a voice note that he and his family had been living in fear for a week.\n\n\"We were told to go to the south, but we couldn’t because the Israeli army has surrounded the area, either with dirt barricades or using quadcopter drones. We can’t move, it’s too difficult.\"\n\n\"At the same time, because of the intense bombing we’re living in constant terror. My daughter has become sick and she has a fever. Her entire body is shaking in fear because of the sound of the bombings and I don’t know what to do with her. I can’t even take her to the hospital,\" he added.\n\nGaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of 42 people killed by Israeli air and artillery strikes in Jabalia and neighbouring areas on Tuesday.\n\nThey reportedly included 11 members of the same family, nearly all of them women and children, whose home was destroyed in an air strike overnight.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Tuesday that its troops had killed “dozens of terrorists” in the Jabalia area over the previous day.\n\nOn Monday,Israeli human rights groups warned of what they called “alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement the Generals’ Plan”, echoing widespread Palestinian concerns.\n\nThe controversial plan calls for the forcible transfer of all civilians in the north followed by a siege of the Hamas fighters remaining there to force their surrender and the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nThe Israeli military denies it is being implemented, saying it is only “getting civilians out of harm's way”.\n\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 42,340 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nThe US president is set to meet with Russian President Putin in Alaska concerning a potential ceasefire.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nThe US military is preparing to activate troops as part of Trump's crackdown on street crime.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets certain conditions.",
        "source_3": "The Biden-Harris administration is giving Israel 30 days to improve humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza or else the US could halt military assistance, according to a letter sent this week to the Israeli military.\n\nThe Oct. 13 missive, signed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, threatens to pause the delivery of US weapons and aid to Israel unless the Jewish state provides assurance that humanitarian aid is flowing into Gaza unhindered, according to the US State Department.\n\nThe warning comes as President Biden has spent months voicing his growing frustration with the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has become a major issue among Democratic voters — especially young Democrats — as Election Day looms.\n\nThe American officials found that since April, there has been a significant deterioration in the amount of aid entering Gaza despite Israel’s vow to keep food and supplies coming in March.\n\n“To reverse the downward humanitarian trajectory and consistent with its assurances to us, Israel must — starting now and within 30 days — act on the following concrete measures,” the letter reads.\n\nThe US is calling for Israel to focus on three main categories: increasing humanitarian aid supplies by the winter, facilitating a delivery route through Jordan, and ending the state of “isolation” in northern Gaza.\n\nBlinken and Austin added that Israel must allow at least 350 aid trucks daily to the Gaza Strip along all four border crossings and to create a fifth passage, as well.\n\n“Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for U.S. policyunder NSM-20and relevant U.S. law,” the letter states — referring to the policy that requires recipients of foreign aid to comply with international laws of war, and not to prevent humanitarian aid to civilians.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller did not specify what those consequences might be but said the US and Israel were in active talks about aid in Gaza.\n\n“We have been having a number of ongoing conversations with them about the very serious decrease in the level of humanitarian assistance,” Miller told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe letter was sent the same day Vice President Kamala Harris called on Israel to ramp up aid to Gaza following reports from the UN World Food Programme about a significant halt in deliveries to the Palestinian enclave.\n\n“The UN reports that no food has entered northern Gaza in nearly 2 weeks,” Harris wrote on X. “Israel must urgently do more to facilitate the flow of aid to those in need.\n\n“Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected,” she added.\n\nThe letter was sent to Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, who spoke with Austin on Sunday to reassure his American counterpart that the Jewish state was not implementing a plan to seal off aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve Hamas, Axios reports.\n\nReports of the “siege and starvation” plan raised immediate concerns among humanitarian groups working in Gaza who feared the strategy would punish refugees in the area who have been repeatedly displaced by the fighting between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“A military siege that deprives civilians of essential means of survival is unacceptable,” UN humanitarian coordinator Muhannad Hadi said in a statement.\n\n“Civilians must not be forced to choose between displacement and starvation,” he added.\n\nNorthern Gaza continues to see intense fighting as Hamas terrorists continue to reemerge in the area despite heavy losses and more than a year of intense airstrikes.\n\nIsrael has implemented wider and wider evacuation calls in the area to try and isolate Hamas in an attempt to clear northern Gaza once and for all, but thousands of civilians remain as they have nowhere else to go in the wartorn territory.\n\nAlong with the humanitarian crisis in northern Gaza, US officials are also concerned with the flow of aid arriving at other crossing stations, according to the letter.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly denied hindering deliveries, noting that 30 trucks carrying flour and food from the UN had entered Gaza on Sunday.\n\nFollowing reports of America’s frustration over the lack of aid, the IDF’s X account wrote a post claiming that more than 9,000 tons of humanitarian aid, “including food, water, gas, shelter equipment and medical supplies,” have been delivered since Oct. 1.\n\nUN officials have said that the current amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough to help feed the more than 1 million refugees displaced by the fighting.\n\nJames Elder, spokesman for the UN children’s agency UNICEF, said the situation has only gotten worse since Israel began restricting aid when the war began.\n\n“We see now what is probably the worst restrictions we’ve seen on humanitarian aid, ever,” Elder said in a statement.\n\nIsrael is also facing renewed scrutiny over its military operations in Gaza after an airstrike near a hospital in northern Gaza sparked a fire at a refugee camp that killed four people.\n\nThe war has so far claimed the lives of more than 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health, which does not differentiate between civilians and terrorists.\n\nThe IDF estimates that in a year since the war began, about 17,000 terrorists have been killed in Gaza."
