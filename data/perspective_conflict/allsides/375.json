        "source_1": "The White House issued a memo Tuesday offering to payfederal workerswho don't want to return to the office through Sept. 30, as long as they resign by Feb. 6.\n\nWhy it matters:The action, first reported by Axios, marks an acceleration in PresidentTrump'salready unprecedented purge of the federal workforce.\n\nDriving the news:The Office of Personnel Management described the offer as administrative leave with pay and benefits.\n\nState of play:Employees who wish to resign were told: \"1) Select \"Reply\" to this email. You must reply from your government account. A reply from an account other than your .gov or .mil account will not be accepted. 2)Type the word \"Resign\" into the body of this reply email. Hit \"Send.\"\n\nZoom in:\"The government-wide email being sent today is to make sure that all federal workers are on board with the new administration's plan to have federal employees in office and adhering to higher standards. We're five years past COVID and just 6 percent of federal employees work full-time in office. That is unacceptable,\" a senior administration official tells Axios.\n\nThe big picture:The memo is just the latest step in the White House's unprecedented move to push career federal workers out of their jobs, and, observers say, replace them with loyalists — a return to a patronage system that federal law sought to banish more than a century ago.\n\nBetween the lines:Manyfederal workers are already feeling scared about the administration's crackdown on DEI, its return-to-office policy and the reclassification efforts.\n\nWhat they're saying:The largest federal employee union, known as AFGE, denounced the buyouts.\n\nReality check:The White House claim that only 6% of federal workers are in-person is widely disputed, and contradicted bydata released by the Biden administrationlast month.\n\nState of play: Earlier on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has the authority tofire federal employees.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with confirmation from the Office of Personnel Management, details of an OPM memorandum and further context.",
        "source_2": "US President Donald Trump has offered federal workers the option to resign and receive pay for eight months, in a major effort to shrink and reform the US government.\n\nIn an email, his administration has asked almost all government employees to decide by 6 February whether they want to be part of a \"deferred resignation\" programme that will mean them leaving their jobs no later than the end of September.\n\nThose who received the email have voiced confusion about what the deal would mean in practice.\n\nThe website of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) gives an outline of the plans, stating on an FAQs page that those who accept the deal are \"not expected to work\", except in rare cases.\n\nIt also says anyone who decides to quit will be exempt for the remainder of their contracts from Trump's requirement that they work in the office rather than at home.\n\nSenior Trump officials told US media that the plan could save the government up to $100bn (£80bn).\n\nDelivering the offer, a message from the OPM, the government's HR agency, highlighted planned reforms including a requirement that most employees work in their offices five days a week.\n\nSince returning to the White House last week, Trump has already declared the end of Covid-era home working practices.\n\nThe OPM said the offer was available to \"all full-time federal employees\" - excluding certain staff such as postal workers, members of the military, immigration officials, and some national security teams.\n\nWorkers wishing to take the deal were asked to reply to the email with the word \"resign\" in the subject line. The offer has been described as \"very generous\" by the White House.\n\nThe message also warned of future downsizing that could impact those who chose to stay. \"We cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity,\" it read.\n\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN that federal workers were \"overwhelmingly left of centre\", and that it was \"essential\" for Trump to \"get control of government\".\n\nThe move has been condemned. In a statement to US media, the head of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union warned that this \"purging\" process would have \"vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government\".\n\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine was among those questioning Trump's power to make such deals. \"If you accept that offer and resign, he'll stiff you just like he stiffed contractors,\" he said. \"He doesn't have any authority to do this. Do not be fooled by this guy.\"\n\nThe returning US president repeatedly pledged to cut the size of the government and slash federal spending while on the campaign trail.\n\nHe tasked Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy with leading an advisory body focused on cutting regulations, spending, and headcounts within the federal government. Ramaswamy has since left this new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to run for governor of Ohio.\n\nBut the email on Tuesday bore resemblance to one sent to employees of Twitter, now X, in late 2022 after Musk bought the social media platform. He asked for an emailed response if they wanted to remain at the company.\n\nAre you a US federal employee who has been offered an incentive package?Get in touch.\n\nThe mass offer came at the end of an at-times chaotic day in Washington, followinga memo Trump issued which said he would pause federal grants, loans and other assistance.\n\nA district judge suspended the order - which was initially set to go into effect on Tuesday afternoon - until next Monday.\n\nIn the hours before that decision, there was widespread confusion over which federal programmes and organisations would be impacted. The White House repeatedly sought to assuage concerns that Social Security payments and Medicaid access could be disrupted.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, top Democrats expressed \"extreme alarm\" about the plan to pause funding.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at restricting young people's access to gender-related medical treatments.\n\nThe order, titled Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, says it would prevent those aged under 19 from making \"life-altering\" choices.\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another,\" the order said.\n\nIt is unclear how the order would be implemented and it is likely to be challenged in court.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

        "source_3": "President Trump continued his crusade to thin out the federal bureaucracy byofferingall 3 million federal workers eight months’ salary in exchange for resigning from their positions.\n\nUnder the deal, employees who resign by Feb. 6 would receive severance paid through Sept. 30, an unprecedented buyout for the federal government.\n\nWhite House officials say the move could entice 5% to 10% of the federal workforce to quit, resulting in a savings of around $100 billion. Any government employee is eligible for the buyout, though military personnel are exempt.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said American taxpayers deserve federal employees “who actually show up to work in our wonderful federal buildings, also paid for by taxpayers.”\n\n“If they don’t want to work in the office and contribute to making America great again, then they are free to choose a different line of work, and the Trump administration will provide a very generous payout of 8 months,” she said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration did not guarantee that workers who don’t accept the buyout would keep their jobs.\n\nAnemailfrom the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources department, said it could not give workers “full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.”\n\n“Should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions,” the email said.\n\nThe email included a sample resignationletterfor federal employees.\n\n“If you chose not to continue in your current role in the federal workforce, we thank you for your service to our country and you will be provided with a dignified fair departure from the federal government utilizing a deferred resignation program.”\n\nFederal workers and unions decried the buyouts as part of a larger plan to eliminate civil servants.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, opposed the move.\n\n“This offer should not be viewed as voluntary. Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies it is clear that the Trump administration’s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.\n\nOf the 3 million federal workers, roughly 374,000 or 12%, work in the Washington metropolitan area, which includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and parts of West Virginia, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nThe largest percentage of federal workers are employed outside the nation’s capital.\n\nFederal workers account for the 15th largest workforce in the nation, and their average tenure is 11.8 years, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Office of Personnel Management data.\n\nThe number of federal workers has increased steadily for decades. In November 2000, federal employment, excluding the Postal Service, stood at nearly 1.9 million. That number has grown by roughly 1% each year, Pew Research said.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs employs more than 486,000 people, the largest payroll of the 18 Cabinet-level agencies, according to Pew. Most of the employees work for the Veterans Health Administration, which operates the VA’s network of hospitals, clinics and nursing homes.\n\nThe smallest Cabinet-level agency is the Department of Education, which Mr. Trump has pledged to abolish, with 4,245 workers.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, took to the Senate floor Tuesday evening to warn federal employees against accepting the “sweetheart offers,” saying Mr. Trump doesn’t have the budgetary authority to offer severance packages and will renege on them anyway, as the senator said he had when he was a real-estate and casino tycoon.\n\n“Don’t be fooled. He’s tricked hundreds of people with that offer. If you accept that offer and resign, he’ll stiff you just like he stiffed the contractors” he’d worked with, Mr. Kaine said.\n\nMr. Trump’s directive builds on a campaign promise to reduce the size of the federal workforce and reshape the federal bureaucracy. He has long argued that unelected bureaucrats are making decisions that harm everyday Americans and weaponize the government against him.\n\nHours after his inauguration, Mr. Trump ordered federal agencies to require workers to return to work full-time. He signed an executive order eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion offices in federal agencies and ending such practices in hiring and federal contracting.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump announced plans to make it easier to fire certain federal workers by rescheduling them into a new classification that removes their civil service protections.\n\nIn a memorandum to all federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management released guidance called “Schedule Career/Policy,” a rebranded version of his move reclassifying workers as Schedule F at the end of his first term.\n\nThe memo accompanies an executive order directing federal agencies to review positions that might fit into the new classification.\n\nCorrection: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the story listed the incorrect number of federal workers in the first paragraph.\n\n• Jeff Mordock can be reached atjmordock@washingtontimes.com.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Washington Times, LLC.Click\n                            here for reprint permission.\n\nPope Leo should tell Catholics: Marry young, have many children\n\nTrump’s TikTok delays undermine his China hawks while Intel controversy grows"
