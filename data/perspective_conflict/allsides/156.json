(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — National Public Radio and three of its local stations sued PresidentDonald Trumpon Tuesday, arguing that hisexecutive order cutting fundingto the 246-station network violates their free speech and relies on an authority that he does not have.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for NPR and PBS, either directly or indirectly. The president and his supporters argue their news reporting promotes liberal bias and shouldn’t be supported by taxpayers.\n\nRetaliation is Trump’s plain purpose, the lawsuit argues. It was filed in federal court in Washington by NPR and three Colorado entities — Colorado Public Radio, Aspen Public Radio and KUTE, Inc., chosen to show the system’s diversity in urban and rural areas.\n\n“By basing its directives on the substance of NPR’s programming, the executive order seeks to force NPR to adapt its journalistic standards and editorial choices to the preferences of the government if it is to continue to receive federal funding,” Katherine Maher, NPR’s CEO, said Tuesday.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Trump is acting to contravene the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation set up to distribute federal funding to NPR and PBS, which is intended to insulate the system from political interference. Congress has appropriated $535 million yearly to CPB for 2025, 2026 and 2027.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said that CPB “is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime,” so Trump was exercising his authority under the law. “The president was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective,” Fields said.\n\nTrump hasn’t hidden his feelings about NPR, calling it a “liberal disinformation machine” in an April social media post.\n\nThe court fight seemed preordained, given that the heads of NPR and PBSboth reacted to Trump’s moveearlier this month with statements that they believed it was illegal. The absence of PBS from Tuesday’s filing indicates the two systems will challenge this separately; PBS has not yet gone to court, but is likely to soon.\n\n“PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans,” PBS spokesman Jeremy Gaines said Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s attempts to dismantle government-run news sources likeVoice of AmericaandRadio Free Europe/Radio Libertyhave also sparked court fights.\n\nThe administration has battled with the press on several fronts. The Federal Communications Commission is investigating ABC, CBS and NBC News. The Associated Press alsowent to courtafter the administration restricted access to certain events in response to the organization’s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico as Trump decreed.\n\nThe lawsuit says 11% of Aspen Public Radio’s budget is provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It is 6% for the Colorado Public Radio, a network of 19 stations, and 19% of KUTE’s budget. That station was founded in 1976 by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.\n\nNPR notes that the order attempts to prohibit individual stations in NPR’s system from using any federal money to buy NPR programming, like “All Things Considered,” the most listened-to afternoon radio news program in the country, its early counterpart “Morning Edition” and cultural programming like theTiny Desk concerts.\n\nThe order “directly interferes with editorial independence by requiring them to seek programming elsewhere,” the lawsuit said.\n\nNPR says it also provides infrastructure services to hundreds of public radio stations and without it, their coverage area would shrink. It also provides the backbone for emergency alert systems across the country.\n\n“Public broadcasting is an irreplaceable foundation of American civic life,” Maher said. “At its best, it reflects our nation back to itself in all our complexity, contradictions and commonalities and connects our communities across differences and divides.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAlawsuitfiled Tuesday by National Public Radio (NPR) against the Trump administration quotes words scribed by former conservative U.S.Supreme CourtJustice Antonin Scalia nearly 40 years ago.\n\nThe lawsuit, which includes three Colorado public radio stations as plaintiffs,challenges PresidentDonald Trump's executive order signed on May 1, whichcalled forceasing congressionally approved federal fundingfor NPR andPBS.\n\n\"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields toldNewsweekon Tuesday. \"Therefore, the president is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS.\n\n\"The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"\n\nOn the sixth page of the 43-page suit, plaintiffs cite the words of Scalia from his dissent in the June 1988 decisionMorrison v. Olson: \"It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. 'But this wolf comes as a wolf.'\"\n\nThat case determined that the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, a federal law passed after the Watergate scandal, was constitutional. Scalia argued for the separation of powers, claiming the law deprives the president of \"exclusive control.\"\n\n\"Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effect important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately evident, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive analysis,\" Scalia wrote in his dissent. \"But this wolf comes as a wolf.\"\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Trump's executive order \"violates the expressed will ofCongressand the First Amendment's bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\"\n\nThe three Colorado-based news stations are Aspen Public Radio, Colorado Public Radio, and KSUT Public Radio.\n\nTheodore J. Boutrous, Jr., a partner at Gibson Dunn and counsel for NPR, toldNewsweekon Tuesday that Trump's executive order \"is blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"It contravenes the will of Congress and violates the constitutional rights of NPR and its member stations,\" Boutrous said. \"The Public Broadcasting Act and the First Amendment both protect the editorial independence of NPR and local public radio stations that receive federal funding from precisely this kind of governmental interference.\n\n\"And, by seeking to halt federal funding to NPR, the executive order harms not only NPR and its member stations, but also the tens of millions of Americans across the country who rely on them for news and cultural programming, and vital emergency information.\"\n\nThe suitreferences Trump's past statementsabout NPR and PBS, including that their news and other content is not \"fair, accurate, or unbiased.\" The president has also said that they spread \"radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"\n\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher, in a statement issued Tuesday, called Trump's executive order an \"affront\" to NPR and its 246 locally owned, nonprofit, noncommercial member stations across all 50 states and territories.\n\nAttorney Bradford Cohen, who has represented Trump as a client, toldNewsweekthat lawsuits against Trump traditionally fall by the wayside and \"for the most part\" are unsuccessful against him and his policies.\n\n\"I think the lawsuit lacks substance and teeth and is most likely for press purposes. ... I believe with the current case law this lawsuit is ripe for a motion to dismiss,\" Cohen said. \"I am sure the president is apprised of the lawsuits filed against the administration, and the DOJ takes a very aggressive stance in terms of dealing with them.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if NPR ends up in a worse legal position than they are currently facing.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani views the suit differently, saying that the First Amendment argument at the core of the litigation is probably NPR's best legal avenue forward.\n\n\"I do think NPR does have a very strong argument,\" Rahmani toldNewsweek. \"These similar cases have been winning in the courts, and I expect NPR to win as well.\"\n\nHe said other factors that could impact the case include the appropriations clause in the Constitution, which essentially states that Congress has \"the power of the purse.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social in April:\"NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO 'DAMAGE TRUMP.'\" THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!\"\n\nKatherine Maher, CEO of NPR, in a statement on Tuesday:\"This is retaliatory, viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as 'biased.' NPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our Member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.\"\n\nPBS President and CEO Paula Kerger, earlier this month:\"The president's blatantly unlawful executive order...threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to dismiss Trump's executive order as unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nEarlier this month, it was revealed that episodes of the longtime popular PBS children's showSesame Streetwillbegin airing on Netflixlater this year.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek investigative reporter based in Michigan.

        "source_3": "Left-leaning National Public Radio (NPR) is suing President Donald Trump’s administration over an executive order that halts its federal funding, which Republican lawmakers have been trying to achieve.\n\nNPR levied the lawsuit on Tuesday and it is alsoconcernedabout PBS losing funding, CBS News reported.\n\nThe executive order Trumpfileda few weeks ago halted funds to PBS and NPR and claimed the organizations which are funded via taxpayer money have exercised political bias, according to Breitbart News.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the suit was brought by NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations. It argues that Mr. Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment and provisions of the Public Broadcasting Act, which was passed by Congress in 1967. The plaintiffs also assert that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to stop federal funding for NPR and PBS, and his order should be invalidated as unconstitutional.\n\nTrump’s executive order states in part that American citizens have a right to expect that “if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.”\n\n“No media outlet has a constitutional right to taxpayer subsidies, and the Government is entitled to determine which categories of activities to subsidize,” the order read.\n\nIn January, Trump’s head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, ordered an investigation into NPR and PBS over concerns the public broadcasters might have been breaking federal law by airing commercials, Breitbart Newsreportedat the time.\n\nThe following month, Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) and Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL)introducedlegislation to end taxpayer subsidizing of NPR.\n\nSen. Tex Cruz (R-TX) recentlycalledout NPR for left-wing bias against Trump after he signed the executive order, per Breitbart News.\n\nNPR on Tuesdaynotedthat PBS is not a party to the recent lawsuit and its statement on the matter read, “PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans.”"
