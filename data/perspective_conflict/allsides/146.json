The secret proposal shows far more flexibility on both points.\n\nThe intrigue:Iran has consistently said it won't sign any deal that bans enrichment for civilian purposes — a red line that is irreconcilable with the U.S. public posture.\n\nWhat they're saying:The White House did not deny any of the details of the proposal described to Axios.\n\nBreaking it down:The proposal Witkoff submitted on Saturday describes \"preliminary ideas\" to be discussed in the next round of talks.\n\nZoom in:According to the proposal, the nuclear deal will focus on creating a regional enrichment consortium that meets several conditions:\n\nThe proposal says sanctions reliefwill be granted only after Iran \"demonstrates real commitment\" to the satisfaction of the U.S. and IAEA.\n\nThe other side:Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Monday that the U.S. side had so far not provided sufficient assurances in terms of when and how sanctions would be lifted.\n\nFriction point:The new U.S. proposal is likely to alarm Netanyahu and his aides, who have been lobbying their U.S. counterparts hard to accept only the most restrictive possible deal with Iran.\n\nFlashback:The U.S. offer is similar in many key respects to the 2015 Iran deal, though it differs in some aspects. Trump withdrew from the Obama-era deal in 2018.\n\nWhat's next:A sixth round of nuclear talks is expected to be scheduled in the coming days.",
        "source_2": "Lazar Berman is The Times of Israel's diplomatic reporter\n\nThe US proposal for a nuclear deal presented to Iran on Saturday allows some limited uranium enrichment within the country,Axios reports, citing two sources with direct knowledge.\n\nThe proposal, presented to Iran on Saturday by Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, would forbid Iran from building new enrichment facilities and dismantle enrichment infrastructure, as well as stop Iran from new research and development of centrifuges.\n\nHowever, Iran would be able to keep enriching in above-ground facilities to three percent, the level needed to fuel a civilian nuclear reactor.\n\nIt will have to stop enriching to higher levels, as it currently does, and will have to mothball its underground enrichment facilities for a to-be-agreed-upon period.\n\nA regional enrichment consortium would provide Iran with any additional low-enriched uranium it needs for civilian purposes.\n\nSanctions would be eased after Iran “demonstrates real commitment” to the terms of the deal, as determined by Washington and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n“President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,” says Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in response, without denying the details of the offer.\n\n“Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it’s in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the Administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media.”\n\nA senior Iranian diplomat said Monday that Tehran would reject the US proposal, saying that it fails to address Tehran’s interests or soften Washington’s stance on uranium enrichment.\n\nBoth the US and Israel have agreed that any deal must include a requirement for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment activity, and US special envoy Steve Witkoff has insisted that this is a red line he will not back down from.\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal reports that Israeli officials believe the US may drop the demand and proceed with a less comprehensive agreement rather than risk collapsing the negotiations.\n\nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

        "source_3": "WASHINGTON — Iran intends to reject a US-proposed deal Monday that would have Tehran scrap its nuclear program and get rid of its existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium needed to make nuclear bombs, according to a report.\n\n“Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,” a senior diplomat close to Iran’s negotiating team toldReuters.\n\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who has been mediating discussions between Washington and Tehran, presented the deal to Iranian officials Saturday.\n\nThe proposal was the result of five rounds of discussions between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.\n\nTehran has protested Trump’s demand to give up its nuclear program, claiming it wants to retain it for civilian purposes.\n\n“In this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,” the diplomat told Reuters.\n\nThe person also said Tehran felt the proposal was “completely one-sided,” the outlet reported.\n\nIran may be willing to accept some restrictions on enrichment, but Trump has been steadfast on his position seeking the complete nuclear disarmament of Iran, whose leaders have openly called for his assassination in retribution for the killing of Iranian military officer Qasem Soleimani during his first presidential term.\n\nThough Trump has led with the diplomatic approach to ending Iran’s nuclear program, he has never publicly ruled out acting on prior threats to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites if needed.\n\nEarlier in the talks, Witkoff brieflyfloated allowing Iran to hold onto its facilitiesif it promised to keep uranium enrichment levels lower than what’s needed for weapons, a plan that mirrored the Obama administration’s nuclear deal.\n\n“You do not need to run, as they claim, a ‘civil nuclear program’ where you’re enriching past 3.67%,” Witkoff told Fox News host Sean Hannity on April 14. “So this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program.”\n\nBut Witkoffwalked back his comments a day later,saying, “Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East — meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli officials have been quietly discussing the possibility of destroying the Iranian nuclear sites in an airstrike campaign — with or without US support, national security sources have told The Post.\n\nAraqchi said Monday he did “not think Israel will commit such a mistake as to attack Iran” during a press conference in Cairo."
