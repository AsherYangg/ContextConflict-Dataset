        "source_1": "NATO leaders convening Wednesdayin the Netherlandsdelivered President Donald Trump a major win by boosting their defense spending targets.\n\nBut comments he made while flying to the conference were raising fresh concerns about his commitment to the alliance’s core principal of collective defense.\n\nThe split dynamic — where leaders tailored their gathering to appeal to Trump, even as he questions the core provision of membership — made for a charged atmosphere as the conference was getting underway at The Hague.\n\nTrump vowed to stand alongside fellow NATO nations a day after hedging in his support for the alliance’s Article 5 pact, which says an attack against one member is an attack against all.\n\n“We’re with them all the way,” Trump said. “If you take a look at the numbers, we’re with them.”\n\nHe called a pledge to be agreed to Wednesday by NATO countries to increase their defense spending “very big news.”\n\n“NATO is going to become very strong with us,” he said.\n\nTrump, who spent the night at a Dutch royal palace after flying from Washington, attended the summit’s sole plenary session before meeting on the sidelines withUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyand holding a press conference.\n\nRelated live storyTrump in Netherlands for NATO summit as Israel-Iran ceasefire appears to hold\n\nHe’s spending fewer than 24 hours in the Netherlands, an intentionally truncated visit that NATO leaders designed specially to keep Trump’s attention and ensure he didn’t have time to blow up the intended display of unity.\n\nThe central outcome of the summit — a pledge by members to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP in a decade, up from the current target of 2% — is exactly what Trump has been demanding over the past several years.\n\nThe final communiqué in which the spending target will be affirmed was dramatically shortened, omitting any controversial language that might spark resistance from the United States.\n\nAnd while Ukraine and its president are still on the agenda, the country’s war with Russia will take a far less prominent place than in NATO summits past, a sign of the differences emerging between Europe and Trump over how to resolve the conflict.\n\nNATO chief Mark Rutte, whose relationship with Trump extends back to his years as Dutch prime minister, elected to place the spending targets at the center of the summit and made sure to credit Trump for making it happen in a private message that Trump later posted on social media.\n\n“You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done. Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win,” Rutte wrote, before wishing the US president a safe journey to the Netherlands.\n\nThe fawning tone prompted some private eyebrow raising among European officials, but Rutte denied any discomfort when a reporter asked Wednesday whether the episode wasn’t a little embarrassing. And the NATO chief used even more evocative language later in the day, calling Trump the “daddy” who had to intervene after the US president compared Israel and Iran to “two kids in a school yard.”\n\nAs it turned out, Trump didn’t actually have to be at the NATO summit in order to raise fresh concerns about his commitment to the alliance, which he’s not been shy about criticizing in the past.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump stopped well short of offering a full-throated endorsement of thealliance’s cornerstone Article 5 pledgeof collective defense.\n\n“It depends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5,” Trump said when asked about his commitment to the pledge, before adding: ”I’m committed to being their friends and I’m committed to helping them.”\n\nIt was not quite the show of support many European leaders had hoped for, though few officials voiced surprise at Trump’s comments as the summit was getting underway.\n\nFor his part, Rutte said he was unconcerned about Trump’s NATO commitment.\n\n“For me there is absolute clarity that the United States is totally committed to NATO, totally committed to Article 5, and yes, there is also an expectation — that will be fulfilled today — that the Canadians and Europeans will speed up their spending,” he said.\n\nThis story has updated with additional developments.",
        "source_2": "For the Netherlands this was the biggest security operation in its history; for Nato's 32 member states the Hague summit was historic too.\n\nThere were unexpected moments of levity in among the momentous decisions over the looming threat from Russia and raising defence spending to levels not seen since the Cold War.\n\nHere is what we learned from a whirlwind two days in The Hague.\n\nThe main takeaway isthe allies' commitment to a 5% defence spending target, to be reached within a decade. It's a remarkable jump from the current 2% guideline, which currently isn't even met by eight Nato members out of 32.\n\nOnly 3.5% of that figure is meant to be achieved entirely through core defence spending on troops and weapons – while the remaining 1.5% can be put towards \"defence-related expenditure\".\n\nAnd that's a suitably broad concept that can apply to spending even only loosely linked to defence: as long as it is used to \"protect our critical infrastructure, defend our networks, ensure our civil preparedness and resilience, unleash innovation, and strengthen our defence industrial base\".\n\nReaching that 3.5% core defence spending target will still be a significant ask for many Nato countries, many of which currently hover around the 2% line.\n\nPlans to reach the 5% figure will have to be submitted annually and will have to follow a \"credible, incremental path\". A review will take place in 2029.\n\nFor as long as Nato has existed, its Article Five on collective defence has been a core principle that means an attack against one ally is considered an attack on all.\n\nSo when Trump suggested on the way to the summit there were \"numerous definitions\" of the mutual security guarantee, it was a reminder of comments he made on the campaign trail last year, when he suggested if a country did not pay its way \"I would not protect you, in fact I would encourage [Moscow] to do whatever they want\".\n\nThis summit agreement appears to put to bed any lingering concerns about Trump's intentions because it reaffirms \"our ironclad commitment to collective defence\". \"I stand with [Article Five], that's why I'm here,\" he told reporters afterwards.\n\nThat reassurance will be well received by Nato member states seen as under most threat, but then they paid their way anyway. And Trump has gone back to Washington with a deal that means all other member states have agreed to do up their spending too.\n\nThe Russia question was always going to be tricky. Most Nato countries – particularly those in close proximity to the Russian border – are in agreement that Moscow could pose a direct threat to them in the near future; Rutte himself has said Russia could use military force against the alliance within five years.\n\nLast year's end-of-summit declaration referenced – in no uncertain terms – Moscow's \"brutal war of aggression\" several times.\n\nBut Trump has had a much softer approach to Moscow, and has resisted treating it as an adversary. As such it was always unlikely he was going to approve a declaration that labelled Russia as the clear culprit for the bloody Ukraine war, now more than three years old.\n\nSo while the statement mentions the \"long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security\" and reaffirms the need to provide enduring support to Ukraine, there is no specific condemnation of Russia in the communique.\n\nEver since Volodymyr Zelensky's difficult experience in the White House last February, European leaders have sought to avoid getting off on the wrong foot with Donald Trump.\n\nSpain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez went to The Hague already mired in domestic political scandals and he was expecting a tough time.\n\nSpain props up the bottom of the Nato spending league with 1.24% of economic output on defence. He came to The Hague insisting that 2.1% was plenty, and told reporters after signing the summit declaration that Spain considered the amount \"sufficient, realistic and compatible with our social model and welfare state\".\n\nThe Spanish PM was noticeably aloof during the \"family photo\", preferring to stand on the end away from his Nato colleagues. There were suggestions that he had gone out of his way to avoid Trump too.\n\nBut Sánchez had already caught Trump's eye and the US president was having none of it.\n\n\"It's terrible, what they've done,\" said Trump, who accused Madrid of seeking \"a little bit of a free ride\". \"We're negotiating with Spain on a trade deal but we're going to make them pay twice.\"\n\nBecause Spain is a member of the European Union, Trump will find that difficult to do - but Sánchez will go back to Madrid isolated in Nato as well as struggling at home.\n\nNo-one would have been more keenly aware of the potential pitfalls of this summit than Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who was involved in a surprising exchange with the US president in which he referred to him as \"daddy\".\n\nRutte had already flattered Trump in a private message for \"decisive action in Iran\" that \"NO American president in decades could have done\". Trump had then posted his words on his social media network and Rutte denied being embarrassed.\n\nBut then in a joint appearance with Trump on Wednesday, Rutte reacted to Trump describing the war between Israel and Iran as \"like two kids in a schoolyard\" who had had a big fight.\n\n\"And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop.\"\n\nAsked if he had gone too far with his flattery, Rutte said he didn't think so: \"I think he deserves all the praise.\"\n\nTrump, flanked by a smirking Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, seemed amused by the whole thing: \"I think he likes me, if he doesn't… I'll come back and hit him hard. He did it very affectionately: 'Daddy you're my daddy,'\" he laughed.\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\nBruce, who is currently spokeswoman for the state department, has done \"brilliantly\" according to Trump.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky rules out giving up land, as European security officials meet in the UK.",
        "source_3": "President Donald Trump on June 25 joined leaders of the 31 other NATO member countries at a summit where they endorsed a new defense spending target.\n\nThe alliance agreed to a target of 5 percent of each member country’s gross domestic product (GDP), a significant increase on paper from the 2 percent benchmark set during a summit in Wales in 2014."
