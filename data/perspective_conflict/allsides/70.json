Photo: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump's Justice Department and FBI have concluded they have no evidence that convicted sex offender and disgraced financierJeffrey Epsteinblackmailed powerful figures, kept a \"client list\" or was murdered, according to a memo detailing the findings obtained by Axios.\n\nWhy it matters:The findings represent the first time Trump's administration has officially contradicted conspiracy theories about Epstein's activities and his death — theories that had been pushed by the FBI's top two officials before Trump appointed them to the bureau.\n\nZoom in:According to the memo, investigators closely examined footage of Epstein's Manhattan prison cell between around 10:40pm on Aug. 9, 2019, when Epstein was locked in his cell, and around 6:30am the next day, when he was found unresponsive.\n\nZoom out:As MAGA influencers, Patel and Bongino had been among the loudest voices touting Epstein conspiracy theories.\n\nMAGA's media universeand some of its voices on Capitol Hill have expressed frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case since February, when DOJ released a tranche of Epstein-related files that were already publicly available.\n\nConservative figurespanned the disclosure, saying it lacked new information.\n\nThe intrigue:When Elon Musk had a falling out with Trump last month, Musk accused the president of being \"in the Epstein files.\"\n\nMusk laterdeletedhis accusation and other posts on X,sayinghe \"went too far.\"\n\nWhat's next:The DOJ and FBI say in the memo that no \"further disclosure\" of Epstein-related material \"would be appropriate or warranted.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected to say former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer David Schoen represented Donald Trump in Trump's second impeachment trial (not his first one).",

        "source_3": "Notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein didn’t keep a supposed “client list,” and he was not murdered during his short stay in a Manhattan lockup, the Justice Department and FBI reportedly concluded in a joint probe.\n\nThe investigation, the results of which were detailed in a memoobtained by Axios, also found no evidence that Epstein “blackmailed prominent individuals.”\n\nThe Trump administrationplans to releasea video to prove the agencies’ findings on Epstein’s 2019 death, which bred mounds of conspiracy theories.\n\n“He’s the only person in there and the only person coming out. You can see it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in late May.\n\nThe video falls in line with the medical examiner’s assessment post-mortem that Epstein committed suicide, according to the memo.\n\nThe medical examiner’s conclusions were contested by Epstein’s surviving family, who turned to a forensic pathologist who determined that a homicide was far more probable based on the evidence.\n\nNo one else involved in the Epstein case will face charges, according to the memo, beyondhis associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for child sex trafficking and other related crimes.\n\nPresident Trump previously promised to release the apparentlydebunked “client list”during his re-election campaign.\n\nTrump has asserted that he had never visited Epstein’s notorious private island, where scores of underage girls and young women were allegedly abused.\n\nBut the president has said “a lot of people did” — whom he was willing to unmask.\n\nBack in February, Trump’s DOJreleased Epstein’s contact listas part of a long-awaited trove of documents connected to the notorious sex predator.\n\nFormer New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Alec Baldwin and Mick Jagger were among the high-profile names on Epstein’s contact list.\n\nBut the hyped-up February release was panned by critics as containing little to no new information about Epstein’s case.\n\nEpstein’s demise just 36 days into his stay at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has been the source of rampant conspiracy theories for nearly a decade, including rumors that some of the rich and famous on whom he had incriminating information arranged for him to be murdered.\n\nThe disgraced mogul firstpleaded guilty in 2008for soliciting underage sex and was placed on the sex offenders list.\n\nEpstein served just 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a county jail, when he only spent one day a week physically at the facility and the other six out on “work release.”\n\nIn 2014, Virginia Giuffrealleged in a sworn affidavitthat she was sex-trafficked and even used as a “sex slave” for years by Epstein and Maxwell for their own use and for others’,including Prince Andrew, which the former royal continues to deny today.\n\nGiuffre’s bombshell accusation opened the floodgates for other victims to speak out.\n\nWhen Epstein was found dead in 2019, he was awaiting trial on a slew of sex-trafficking charges."
