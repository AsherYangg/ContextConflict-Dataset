        "source_1": "Republicans in Florida couldn’t re-create Trump’s November margins, while Musk’s efforts in Wisconsin failed\n\nDonald Trumpand theRepublicansought to be wary of a possible blue wave in next year’s midterms. On Tuesday, voters inFloridaandWisconsinsignaled dissatisfaction withElon Musk, the GOP and the president. On the surface, the results spelled political equipoise. No seats changed hands.\n\nA closer look, however, reveals possible headaches forDonald Trumpand his party.\n\nIn a special election in Florida’s sixth congressional district to fill the vacancy left by Mike Waltz, Trump’s beleaguered national security adviser, voters elected Randy Fine, a Republican state senator, as Waltz’s replacement. Last November, Trump won the district by a whopping 30 points. By contrast, Fine’s margin wasabout 14 points.\n\nBeyond that, voter turnout was markedly lower than a half-year ago. Talk about underperforming.\n\nThen again, the closeness of the contest came as no surprise to the White House. A poll conducted by Tony Fabrizio, a pollster to the president, actually showed Fine down by four points less than two weeks before the election. Those figures gave Trump and Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, plenty to worry about.\n\nFabrizio’s survey also triggered Trump’s decision to pull the nomination of Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the UN. Although she represented a so-called safe GOP district in upstate New York – “Mississippi with icicles”, in the words of one observer – the president was not prepared to take unnecessary chances.\n\nHe made the right call, politically speaking. Turns out, Florida’s sixth congressional district was not the only storm cloud in the Sunshine state.\n\nThe election to fill the seat vacated by Matt Gaetz, Trump’s first pick for attorney general, in the first congressional district experienced an even larger drop in GOP support. Back in November, Trump garnered a 37-point margin. On Tuesday, Republican Jimmy Patronis carried the district by about13 points, a 24-point decline.\n\nIn hindsight, Trump was right to end Stefanik’s dreams. The GOP dropoffs in Florida’s first and sixth congressional districts signaled that the battle to replace her would have been a nailbiter.\n\nEvery vote counts, the saying goes. Quite possibly doubly so in the House. Mike Johnson maintains control by the thinnest of margins. On a good day, theRepublicanswill now hold 220 seats in the 435-member chamber. The results out of Florida are a warning that his tenure is in jeopardy come January 2027.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the House rejected an attempt to thwart an effort to enable new parents to vote remotely. Nine Republicans joined the Democrats to hand the speaker a humiliating loss. Johnson labeled the result “disappointing”. Theheadline at Axios blared: “Mike Johnson scraps his whole week after brutal defeat”. Apparently, being the party of “traditional family values” doesn’t necessarily translate into support for newborn babies and their moms.\n\nThe results of the Tuesday’s House races also bear strong similarities to the special elections of 2017 and 2018.Back then, Democrats ran about 15 points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s performance on election day 2016.\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nOver in the midwest, voters stuck a finger in the eye of Musk, the king of Doge. Wisconsiniteselected the liberal Susan Crawfordto a seat on the state supreme court. With more than half the vote counted, she held an insurmountable double-digit lead. Musk’s expenditures of time and money in favor of Brad Schimel, her conservative opponent, were in vain.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, Musk handed out$1m checks to voters. In the face of a legal challenge, Musk prevailed, claiming that efforts to restrain his expenditures constituted a violation of his rights under the first amendment.\n\nJust days before the election, Musk also appeared onstagewearing a giant yellow cheese hat. His nod to Wisconsin’s dairy industry and the state’s beloved Green Bay Packers amused the crowd and the denizens of X, the Musk-owned social media platform. Actual voters, however, not as much.\n\nWhether Musk steps back from the spotlight or whether Trump reels him in remains to be seen. Regardless, aMarquette pollshows his favorability ratings to be underwater, 38-60.\n\nWith the stock market in the doldrums, stagflation a real possibility and tariffs on tap, Trump and his minions have a real problem. To add to their woes, estimates peg economic growth for the first quarter of 2025 to be in retrograde. Higher prices loom. The rationale for swing voters to cast their lot with Trump dwindle daily.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIn a major judicial victory forDemocrats, Susan Crawford has won a seat on the WisconsinSupreme Court, defeating conservative former Attorney General Brad Schimel in a high-stakes race.\n\nThe election, held less than 100 days into PresidentDonald Trump's return to the White House, was widely seen as a referendum on his administration. It also drew more than $90 million in spending,including over $25 million alone from Elon Muskand affiliated groups, making it the most-expensive judicial election in American history.\n\nBut, despite heavy investment from conservative donors, voters delivered Crawford a clear 9-point margin.\n\nHer victory preserves the court's 4-3 liberal majority, safeguarding control of one of the most politically consequential state supreme courts in the nation. It also ensures that a court with jurisdiction over hot-button issues—including abortion access, labor rights and redistricting—remain ideologically aligned with Democratic legal positions, heading into a critical election cycle in 2026.\n\nBuoyed by this win, Democrats are optimistic about their prospects in 2026, viewing the election as a sign of growing momentum to flip both legislative chambers in the midterms.\n\n\"This was a test, and Susan's campaign passed with flying colors,\" Patrick Guarasci, senior adviser for Crawford's campaign, toldNewsweek.\n\n\"We knew Wisconsinites would be offended thatElon Muskwanted to come in and buy this election, and leaned into that message, which worked.\n\n\"Democrats now have a road map for a resistance: get a great candidate that voters can identify with and fight back against the big guys who have no idea what real people care about. Leaning into anti-billionaire messaging builds a strong coalition becauseRepublicans, Democrats, urban and rural voters don't want the wealthiest 1 percent controlling our democracy,\" Guarasci said.\n\nThe election could have major implications for reproductive rights in the state, with the court poised to decide on whether abortion rights should remain legal statewide more than two years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade.\n\nAfterRoe v. Wadewas overturned in June 2022, Wisconsin abortion providers halted procedures, fearing prosecution under an 1849 law banning abortion except to save a patient's life. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul challenged the law, arguing it applies only to feticide. A Dane County circuit court judge then temporarily blocked enforcement of the law, but the state supreme court heard arguments in a case over the ban late last year. A ruling in that case is set to be released before Crawford joins the state supreme court bench.\n\nHowever, the court is also expected to hear arguments in a separate case—filed by Planned Parenthood—over whether the Wisconsin constitution protects abortion rights. If it does, the 1849 ban could be struck down completely.\n\nCrawford has avoided speaking directly about the 1849 ban. But, throughout her campaign, she released multiple ads slamming Schimel for his stance on abortion.\n\n\"Brad Schimel wants to make sure women don't have the right to make their own health care decisions. If he wins, that right is gone,\" Crawford said in a recent ad. \"I trust women to make their own health care decisions.\"\n\nHer position on Wisconsin's Supreme Court gives liberals the votes to potentially strike down the 176-year-old ban, a move that would preserve abortion access in one of the Midwest's most closely watched political battlegrounds.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court is also poised to revisit a Republican-backed law that stripped most public employee unions of collective bargaining rights.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker enacted Act 10 in 2011, which significantly restricted collective bargaining rights for most public-sector employees, limiting negotiations to base wages and capping raises at inflation rates unless approved by referendum. It required unions to hold annual certification votes and barred automatic paycheck deductions for union dues. The law also increased employee contributions to pensions and health insurance, while exempting public safety workers such as police staff and firefighters from its restrictions.\n\nA Dane County judge ruled last year that parts of Act 10 violated the state constitution, restoring collective bargaining rights to pre-2011 levels.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to fast-track an appeal, meaning a conservative appeals court will hear the case first, likely delaying it beyond the current term. This ensures Crawford, who previously challenged parts of Act 10 as a private attorney, will be on the bench when it reaches the High Court.\n\nDuring the campaign, Crawford didn't say whether she would recuse herself from the case due to her previous involvement, but noted the current case involves a different provision than the one she previously litigated. She added that, if the same provision were challenged, she would likely step aside.\n\n\"If the same provision that I was involved in litigating back in those early days was challenged again, I most likely would recuse,\" Crawford said.\n\nBut even if she did step aside, then liberals would still have the votes needed to overturn the law. So, with a liberal majority now more solidified, labor advocates are eyeing a path to uphold the previous ruling that found parts of Act 10 unconstitutional.\n\nPerhaps the most politically significant impact of Crawford's win is the role the court could play in redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nIn 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority ruled that Republican-drawn state Assembly andSenatemaps were unconstitutional and ordered new maps to be drawn. As a result, Democrats gained 14 seats in the Assembly and state Senate in 2024.\n\nShortly after, the national Democratic law firm Elias Groupfiled a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin's congressional mapsand asked the Supreme Court to take it up immediately. Although these maps were drawn by Democratic GovernorTony Eversin 2021, they were created under the court's former conservative majority's directive to make the \"least changes\" possible to the congressional districts drawn and passed by Republicans in 2011.\n\nElias Group argued that, since the court's liberal majority in 2023 ruled the \"least changes\" approach \"lacks any basis in Wisconsin redistricting law or precedent\" for state legislative maps, the same logic should apply to Evers' congressional maps. However, the justices denied the firm's request in an unsigned, unanimous order.\n\nCrawford's victory now provides an opportunity for Democrats and their allies to challenge the maps again, potentially arguing that the current district lines were drawn under now-rejected rules. Such rulings could make previously unwinnable districts more competitive for Democrats.\n\nThis month, Elon Musk expressed concern that a liberal court could attempt to redraw the state's Republican-created congressional lines, potentially threatening the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections.\n\n\"Losing this judge race has a good chance of causing Republicans to lose control of the House. If you lose control of the House, there will be nonstop impeachment hearings. There will be nonstop hearings and subpoenas,\" Musk, who runs Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, toldFox Newson Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic U.S. House leader RepresentativeHakeem Jeffriesalso weighed in, calling Wisconsin's congressional maps \"broken.\"\n\n\"As soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fairer lines,\" Jeffries said during an event withDemocratic National Committee(DNC) Chair Ken Martin. \"The only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\"\n\nCrawford's victory provides Democrats with a high-profile morale boost in a swing state that Trump won by less than 1 percent in 2024.\n\nDemocrats celebrated Susan Crawford's victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race as a major win against conservative influence, particularly efforts backed by Musk and Trump.\n\n\"Tonight, the people of Wisconsin squarely rejected the influence of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and billionaire special interests,\" Martin said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) President Heather Williams praised voters for rejecting GOP extremism. \"Despite Republicans' best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future. While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities,\" Williams said in a statement.\n\nBen Wikler, chair of the state'sDemocratic Party, added: \"Tonight, the people of Wisconsin squarely rejected the influence of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and billionaire special interests.\"\n\nCrawford herself highlighted the significance of defeating Musk's influence. \"I've got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world for justice and Wisconsin. And we won!\" she told supporters in her victory speech.\n\n\"Today, Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,\" Crawford added. \"And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.\"\n\nDemocratic pollster Matt McDermott called theRepublicanloss a \"massive failure,\" noting their heavy spending and national support still resulted in a near-double-digit defeat.\n\n\"Really can't overstate how much Republicans tried to win this Wisconsin Supreme Court race. They flooded the zone with outside dollars. Sent in major national figures. And lost by almost double digits. A massive failure for Republicans,\" McDermott wrote on X.\n\nAmid the win, Democrats are optimistic about their prospects in 2026.\n\n\"Wisconsinites' next opportunity to rebuke GOP extremism and affirm Democratic leadership is the state legislative elections in 2026. After several cycles of laying the groundwork to build power in Wisconsin, the DLCC and state Democrats made massive gains in 2024 under fair maps. You can bet we're laser-focused on finishing the job and flipping both chambers this cycle,\" Williams said.\n\n\"The biggest takeaway for Democrats from that race is that there is a voting bloc who may have voted for Trump that Democrats can recover,\" Guarasci added in a statement toNewsweek.\n\n\"But they have to fight for and earn people's votes. To keep up the momentum, Democrats have to show every day how they are fighting for everyday people.\"\n\nUpdate 4/03/25, 12:33 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Patrick Guarasci.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

        "source_3": "WHAT THE FLORIDA AND WISCONSIN ELECTIONS MEAN.Were there any surprises from the two House elections inFloridaand the Supreme Court race inWisconsin? Not really. Democrats were desperately hoping to strike a blow against PresidentDonald Trumpwherever they could. For a moment, they thought they might get close enough in one of the Florida races, not to win, but to embarrass the president. That didn’t happen. Then, in Wisconsin, they thought they might be able to attack Trump by attacking Elon Musk, who parachuted in to campaign for the conservative candidate. That turned out to be a big success for Democrats.\n\nFirst, the Florida races.The bottom line is the Republican candidateswon by double digits. In the 6th District, the GOP’s Randy Fine won by 14 points, and in the 1st District, Republican Jimmy Patronis won by 15. From the Democratic perspective, neither winning Republican came close to matching Trump’s 30-point margin of victory in those districts last November. But no realistic analyst would expect an April special election to match Trump’s 2024 victory. Fine and Patronis did what they needed to do.\n\nNow, the question is what,if any, predictive value the two races will have for the 2026 midterm elections. Who knows? Democrats will concede that, no, they didn’t pick up districts Trump won by 30 points. But what about districts Trump won by 10 points? Or 5? Democrats will predict that those House districts, currently represented by Republicans, will be in danger in 2026. Of course, a lot will happen between now and then.\n\nIn addition,Republicans face the grim prospect that presidents almost always lose House seats in midterm elections. First-term presidents and second-term presidents, too. Go all the way back to the 1930s, and there areonly two examplesof presidents picking up seats in midterm elections. One was in 2002, when first-term George W. Bush picked up seats in the wartime aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The other was in 1998, when second-term Bill Clinton picked up seats when voters rejected Republicans who were pursuing impeachment in the Lewinsky scandal. Every other president lost seats.\n\nTrump, of course, is in a unique position.He is serving his second term, but it is not a consecutive second term. He clearly benefited, in both politics and policy, from being out of office for a while. Maybe he will have a better time with the 2026 midterm elections than he did in 2018, when Republicans lost 40 seats. On the other hand, Trump has almost no seats to lose, given the GOP’s super narrow margin in the House. We’ll see, but keeping the House will be hard for Republicans.\n\nThen, there is Wisconsin,where liberal Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford defeated conservative opponent Brad Schimel by a larger-than-expected 10 points. Not too long ago, the race appeared to be mostly about abortion. Watch theMarch 12 debate, and the first and longest segment was about abortion. The argument played out along the usual lines, with Crawford suggesting Schimel wanted to outlaw all abortions and Schimel playing defense. Abortion remained a huge part of the campaign until the end, and it’s entirely possible Crawford would have won had that been the only issue.\n\nBut money in politicswas also an issue in a race in which the two sides together spent about $100 million — the most expensive judicial contest in history. There was the usual suspect, George Soros, pouring money into Crawford’s side, and some conservative usual suspects pouring money into Schimel’s side. And then, Elon Musk got involved in a way that overshadowed everybody else.\n\nFirst, Musk gave more moneyto Schimel’s side, about $20 million, than any other contributor in the race. And then Musk made attention-getting, over-the-top statements. Referring to the fact that the race would determine the future of House redistricting in Wisconsin, Musk said, “What’s happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives — that is why it is so significant. And whichever party controls the House to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”\n\nThat’s pretty heavy.Then, Musk attracted a lot of attention by giving away two $1 million checks to supporters in what opponents called an illegal lottery, but the courts allowed it to go forward. Then, Musk traveled to Wisconsin and wore a cheesehead hat in front of a huge American flag at a rally in Green Bay. Everything Musk did received extensive media coverage, as it was intended to do.\n\nDemocrats quickly pivotedto make Musk the central target of their campaign. Here is the beginning of onepro-Crawford ad: “Attacking Social Security. Cutting Medicaid and cancer research. Dismantling the Department of Education. Elon Musk is out of control, and now the power-hungry billionaire is unloading millions to buy the Wisconsin Supreme Court.”\n\nAnd so on.The race became so focused on the Trump-supporting billionaire that Democrats could credibly argue it was a referendum on Musk, on the Department of Government Efficiency, and on Trump. Each day fired up the anti-Trump resistance even more. The result was a 10-point victory for Crawford in a race that many on the conservative side thought would be within a point or two.\n\nAfter the results were known,Robby Soave, an editor forReason, commented, “My God, the liberal derangement over Elon Musk really is something. The Wisconsin election was NOT a referendum on this man. Republicans have a low-propensity voter problem, and all the money in the world can’t literally buy elections (Democrats are always shocked to learn this.)” A short time later,Chuck Rossof theWashington Free Beaconresponded, “Musk is solely responsible for creating this impression, whether it’s right or wrong. He decided to get heavily, heavily involved in this off-cycle race, portrayed its outcome in apocalyptic terms, and used questionable tactics to persuade his side to vote.”\n\nIndeed he did.What appears to have happened is that Musk, who has had extraordinary, historic success building cars and rockets, now believes himself to be an extraordinary political campaigner, too. It is not difficult to see how he got that idea. He had a lot of success campaigning for Trump in 2024. But perhaps Musk should have considered that the 2024 success had more to do with Donald Trump than with Elon Musk. Musk cannot transfer that political mojo to other races that do not feature Trump.\n\nWisconsin proved that.It might be hard to tell the world’s richest man to stay in his lane, but the president of the United States can, and should, do it.\n\nSo, that is what happened on Tuesday.Republicans won in Florida, and Democrats won in Wisconsin. The elections won’t determine the future course of anything, but on balance, you’d have to say the results were more worrisome for Republicans. And now, after that brief distraction, the focus of the political world shifts back to the Trump White House."
