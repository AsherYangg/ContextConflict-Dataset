        "source_1": "The deadline comes as scores of student aid employees have been terminated.\n\nSome 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections on May 5, the Department of Education announced on Monday.\n\nNext month, for the first time since student loan payments were paused due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Education Department will collect the debts from borrowers who had defaulted -- which means they hadn’t paid their debts for around nine months or 270 days -- before the pandemic.\n\nThe announcement comes as scores of Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees have been terminated at the Department of Education as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to shutter the agency, which creates uncertainty for borrowers and the future of the student loan system, according to former Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal.\n\n“The concern is that the department is, you know, cutting the people who would help borrowers make this transition,” Kvaal told ABC News. “Borrowers who are trying to get help by getting into an affordable repayment plan or by applying for loan forgiveness, if they're eligible, you know, just don't have the same resources that they did before the department staff was cut in half.”\n\nThe pause -- started in 2020 in Trump's first administration -- for all 43 million student loan borrowers was implemented due to the economic hardship and disruption caused by COVID. This will be the first time in five years the repayments have begun.\n\nKvaal said defaults can be “tragic” for borrowers. In some cases, Kvaal said, defaults can negatively impact credit scores and future student aid, and several states revoke driver’s licenses over defaults.\n\nHowever, the department emphasized that its effort will protect taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers \"willingly\" undertook. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon also said taxpayers will no longer be responsible for the “irresponsible student loan policies” of the previous administration.\n\n“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,” McMahon wrote in a department release. “Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment -- both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”\n\nA defaulted loan is a loan that a borrower hasn't made payments on for 270 days, according to the office of federal student aid. When the loan officially enters default, it becomes eligible for mandatory collections.\n\nThe collections on loans are typically done through wage garnishments, a legal procedure in which a person's earnings are required by court order to be withheld by an employer for the payment of a debt, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nStudent debt can also be collected through offsetting tax refunds or other federal benefits, which Kvaal said can include one’s Social Security. The collections process starting in just two weeks is blocking these borrowers' path out of default, according to Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce. Pierce said the Trump administration is feeding them into the “maw of the government debt collection machine.”\n\n“This is cruel, unnecessary and will further fan the flames of economic chaos for working families across this country,\" Pierce told ABC News in a statement.\n\nBut the administration's efforts to place borrowers into involuntary collections programs will be paired with a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign to ensure borrowers understand how to return to repayment or get out of default, according to the department release.\n\nThe news also comes as the administration is working to rehome the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to other agencies. Trump announced the loan system would be moved to the Small Business Administration “immediately” during a White House event last month.\n\nAfter the announcement, Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News his higher education portfolio under Obama included moving some loan functions to the Department of Treasury. But he warned shifting the student loan portfolio again could lead to real world consequences.\n\n“We're at a point now where millions of borrowers are late on their student loans,” he said. “For the department to be focused on laying off half its staff and going through a fundamental reorganization of how it administers these programs, you know, in really critical weeks for borrowers who are trying to get into repayment plans or get loan forgiveness, I think it's very dangerous and puts at risk millions of borrowers of going into default on their loans.”",
        "source_2": "The U.S. Department of Educationannouncedon Monday that it would resume involuntary collections of defaulted federal student loans on May 5. The announcement means that borrowers who have loans in default could see their tax refunds seized or wages garnished. While many borrowers and advocacy organizations will oppose the move, resuming collections is necessary to incentivize loan repayment. The announcement was never a matter of if, but when.\n\nThe federal government suspended student loan payments in March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic; this meant that payments were not due, interest rates were zero, and loans in default were not collected. The government extended the pause several times before it finally lapsed, in effect, in October 2024. Payments have been due for the past six months, meaning borrowers who don’t pay will face consequences.\n\nYet a staggering number of borrowers are not paying. Just 38% of borrowers are in current repayment, down from around60%pre-pandemic, according to Nelnet, the largest federal student loan servicer. Four million borrowers are more than 90 days delinquent, the threshold at which nonpayment is reported to credit bureaus. Millions more are in a forbearance as they await the outcome of a court battle affecting their repayment plan—but they are also in danger of delinquency when that forbearance eventually expires.\n\nAround five million borrowers are in default. This pool consists entirely of borrowers who were in default before the payment pause took effect. Default occurs after borrowers fail to make a payment for 270 days, meaning not enough time has passed since the pause ended for new defaults to occur. But if delinquencies continue on their current path, ED estimates than 10 million borrowers could end up in default—a quarter of the current loan portfolio.\n\nNo one benefits when borrowers are allowed to default. In addition to collections, borrowers face negative credit reports and lose their eligibility for additional student aid. The government only recovers65 to 75%of defaulted loans on average, so taxpayers lose out too.\n\nIf the student loan program is to continue functioning, though, there must be consequences to discourage default. These consequences have been suspended for the last five years, and the result was plummeting repayment rates. Reimplementing the default-collections system was always going to be necessary, and now is as good a time as ever.\n\nThe Department of Education announced that the Treasury Offset Program, which seizes the tax refunds and Social Security payments of defaulted borrowers, will restart on May 5. The department also plans to reimplement administrative wage garnishment for defaulted borrowers sometime over the summer. Borrowers in default will receive notice of these actions over the next two weeks, so they have the opportunity to rehabilitate their loans and/or enroll in a repayment plan before the consequences take effect. Borrowers may contact theDefault Resolution Groupto do so.\n\nThese moves will only immediately affect the five million borrowers currently in default, who were in default before the pandemic. Borrowers who haven’t made payments for the past six months, but weren’t in default pre-pandemic, still have time to start paying their loans again and avoid collections. Allowing these borrowers a window to avoid default is one benefit of restarting collections now, rather than waiting for the next wave of defaults to hit.\n\nOne can forgive borrowers for being confused in this moment. The Biden administration was an avalanche of mixed messages: The payment pause was going to end several times, before officials extended it at the last minute; the government was going to offer loan forgiveness, before courts struck it down and Biden tried (and failed) to deliver it another way. Many borrowers report that theydidn’t knowpayments were due.\n\nThe new administration hopes to change that. Its press release was clear: “There will not be any mass loan forgiveness.”Education Secretary Linda McMahon didn’t mince words in aWall Street Journalop-ed: “If you are a student borrower with a federal loan balance and haven’t been making payments, you must restart payments now.”\n\nThe announcement also indicated that the Department of Education “will conduct a robust communications campaign to engage all borrowers on the importance of repayment.” The agency will communicate with borrowers directly to remind them of their loan obligations and provide resources to get them paying again.\n\nThe department will also restart processing of applications for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR), which allows borrowers to tie loan payments to their incomes. The Biden administration stopped processing IDR applications in August 2024, allowing a backlog of 1.9 million application forms to build up. ED promises more information on this effort next week.\n\nAll this is a promising start. But restoring the student loan program to health will require a sustained effort by the Trump administration. The new announcement must be the beginning of a campaign to get borrowers paying their loans again. It will take sustained communication and deft management to get us out of this mess.",
        "source_3": "The Department of Education (DoEd) is gearing up to restart involuntary debt collection for its defaulted federal student loan portfolio after pausing collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, the department announced Monday.\n\nThe Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) will officially resume collections of its defaulted federal student loan portfolio on May 5 — until then, borrowers in default will receive emails from FSA making them aware of the change and offeringinformation and assistance. By summer, FSA will send notices before beginning administrative wage garnishment, according to DoE.\n\nDoEd noted that it has not collected on defaulted loans since March of 2020, and while Congress mandated borrower repayment in Oct. 2023, the agency said the Biden-Harris administration “refused to lift the collections pause and kept borrowers in a confusing limbo.” DoEd also accused the Biden-Harris administration of failing to process applications for borrowers who applied for income-driven repayment and “continued to push misguided ‘on-ramps’ and illegal loan forgiveness schemes to win points with borrowers and mask rising delinquency and default rates.”\n\nRELATED:U.S. Appeals Court Blocks Joe Biden’s Student Debt Forgiveness Plan\n\n“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,”U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\n“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,” McMahon continued. “Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment—both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”\n\nIn a media call ahead of the DoEd’s announcement, a senior department official said the federal student loan portfolio “is headed toward a fiscal cliff if we don’t start repayment and collections.”\n\nIn its official announcement, the DoEd pointed to the more than 42.7 million borrowers who own more than $1.6 trillion in student debt. According to the department, more than 5 million borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days and sit in default, many for more than 7 years. Four million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, which is 91-180 days.\n\n“As a result, there could be almost 10 million borrowers in default in a few months. When this happens, almost 25 percent of the federal student loan portfolio will be in default,” the DoEd assessed.\n\nThe department said only 38 percent of borrowers are in repayment and are current on their student loans. Most of the remaining borrowers are eitherdelinquent on their payments, in an interest-free forbearance, or in an interest-free deferment, according to DoEd. A small percentage of borrowers are in a 6-month grace period or in-school.\n\nAlmost 1.9 million borrowers “have been unable to even begin repayment because of a processing pause put in place bythe previous administration,” DoEd said, noting that it iscurrently working with federal student loan servicers and hopes to begin processing next month.\n\n“The current administration believes that American taxpayers can no longer serve as collateral for student loans,” the senior department official said. “Student loan debt must be paid back.”\n\n“And then, going forward, we totally believe that Congress has a role to play in fixing the higher education system that puts students in a position where they can afford their loan payments,” the official added. “So we’re looking forward to working with Congress on their efforts to streamline loan repayment, as well as lowering college costs.”\n\nA senior department official told media that the effort will involve a “robust communication strategy” and partnerships with states, colleges and universities to educate borrowers on expectations and the repayment process.\n\nThe communication strategy includes outreach to borrowers through emails and social media, resources like a new Loan Simulator, an AI Assistant named “Aiden,” and extended servicers call time, according to the department. FSA is also working to streamline the time it takes for borrowers to enroll in Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, and more information will be postedherenext week.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.
