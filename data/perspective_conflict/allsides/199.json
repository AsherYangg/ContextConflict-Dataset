        "source_1": "US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Washington is “very close” to reachinga nuclear deal with Iranafter Tehran “sort of” agreed to its terms.\n\n“Iran has sort of agreed to the terms: They’re not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust. We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,” he said.\n\nIranian officials haven’t publicly commented on Trump’s remarks, though the comments were reported by the country’s semi-official ISNA news agency. CNN has requested a comment from Iran’s mission to the United Nations.\n\nSpeaking at a business roundtable in the Qatari capital Doha, Trump reiterated that Iran “can’t have a nuclear weapon” and suggested that negotiators are “getting very close to maybe doing a deal.”\n\nDuring his Gulf tour, Trump has repeatedly warned that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon, threatening to strike the country if it fails to reach a nuclear deal. But he has not explicitly ruled out Iran enriching uranium on its own soil. While uranium is used as a nuclear fuel, it can be weaponized if enriched to high levels.\n\nRelated video‘Enemies get you motivated’: Trump threatens ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran\n\nIran has said that its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable, but the Trump administration has sent mixed signals on its position on the matter.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart last week, US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff said that an enrichment program in Iran is a “red line” for the US. In an earlier interview with Fox News, he had suggested that Iran could be allowed to enrich uranium to low levels.\n\nSeveral rounds of talks have taken place between the US and Iran, but the most recent one in the Omani capital Muscat last weekend was described by the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson as “difficult.”\n\nA senior Trump administration official gave a more positive assessment, telling CNN the discussions, which lasted over three hours, were encouraging.\n\nGlobal oil prices fell after Trump’s comments. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell over 3% Thursday morning to $64 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, was trading down 3.5% to almost $61 a barrel around the same time.\n\nIt is unclear what Trump meant by “nuclear dust,” but Gulf states, including Qatar, are concerned that an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could cause anenvironmental catastrophein the region and drag them into a wider regional war.\n\n“For this country in particular, because you’re right next door, you’re a stone’s throw away, not even, right? You’re a foot away. You can walk right into Iran. Other countries are much further away, so probably it’s not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country, this very special place with a special royal family,” he said.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lambasted the threatening remarks by Trump.\n\nThe US president “is naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands,” Pezeshkian told a group of academics during a gathering in Kermanshah Province on Wednesday, according to the Iranian media.  “We will never negotiate our dignity. This is in the blood of every Iranian,”\n\n“You have tried to bring Iran to its knees for the past 47 years. We have existed for thousands of years and will continue as one for the years to come,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his threats, saying he doesn’t want nuclear talks in Iran to take a “violent course.”\n\n“Two courses, there’s only two courses. There aren’t three or four or five, there’s two. There’s a friendly and a non-friendly, and non-friendly is a violent course, and I don’t want that. I’ll say it up front. I don’t want that, but they have to get moving,” the president said.",
        "source_2": "US President Donald Trump says that Iran has \"sort of\" agreed to the terms of a nuclear deal with the United States.\n\nTrump described the latest talks between the two countries, which ended on Sunday, as \"very serious negotiations\" for \"long-term peace\".\n\nEarlier, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader told NBC News that Tehran was willing to make concessions on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.\n\nThe US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons - though Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday in Qatar, on the second stop of his multi-day Gulf tour, Trump said that a deal was close on Iran's nuclear programme and suggested a military strike on Tehran's sites could be avoided.\n\n\"We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,\" Trump said after a meeting in Doha with business leaders.\n\n\"I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.\n\n\"You probably read today the story about Iran. It's sort of agreed to the terms.\"\n\nThe president did not specify which remarks he was referring to, but an adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, said in a US media interview that Tehran was willing to accept far-reaching curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nShamkhani told ABC News that Iran would give up stockpiles of highly enriched uranium as part of a deal in which the US lifts sanctions.\n\nThe latest talks over Tehran's nuclear programme finished on Sunday, with both sides agreeing to meet again.\n\nUS Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said they were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as \"difficult but useful\".\n\nTrump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018.\n\nHe previously warned of possible military action against Iran's nuclear facilities if the fresh set of talks, which began in April, did not succeed.\n\nA senior US official said the latest discussions lasted more than three hours, adding: \"Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements.\n\n\"We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\"\n\nThe chip giants will hand revenues to the US government in exchange for licences to export to China.\n\nTrump says homeless people must go \"far\" from the nation's capital, as part of his anti-crime plan, but the mayor pushes back.\n\nNo one was injured and no inmates escaped as the storm hit Nebraska State Penitentiary, the prison said.\n\nThe Canyon Fire, which began on Thursday afternoon, has blazed through nearly 5,000 acres in less than 24 hours.\n\nTrump says he will meet with the Russian leader in the \"great state of Alaska\".",
        "source_3": "PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he is confidentIranis serious about signing a deal restricting its ability to build nuclear weapons.\n\nAli Shamkhani, a top political, military, and nuclear adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,toldNBC News on Wednesday thatTehran is ready at a moment’s notice to sign a nuclear dealin which Iran would only enrich uranium to lower levels needed for civilian use in exchange for the lifting of all economic sanctions. In Qatar on Thursday morning, Trump alluded to the comments, confirming that a deal is close.\n\n“You probably read today that Iran has sort of agreed to the terms,” he said. “They’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran. And we’ve been strong. I want them to succeed. I want them to end up being a great country, frankly, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon. … And people are getting close to maybe doing a deal.”\n\nShamkhani said the deal would also include Iran committing to never making nuclear weapons, scrapping its highly enriched uranium with a potential for weaponization, and allowing international inspectors to supervise the process. When the outlet asked if Iran would agree to sign an agreement that day with those conditions, he replied, “Yes.”\n\n“It’s still possible. If the Americans act as they say, for sure we can have better relations,” Shamkhani said, adding, “It can lead to a better situation in the near future.”\n\nHis comments are the clearest indication yet of a breakthrough after four rounds of talks among senior Iranian officials, led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and U.S. officials, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff. The latest round of negotiations in Muscat, Oman, was described by Witkoff as “encouraging” and Araghchi as “difficult but useful.”\n\nTrump’s and Khamenei’s insistence on hard-line, occasionally belligerent rhetoric has complicated negotiations. On Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced Trump over his rhetoric on state television.\n\n“He thinks he can come here, chant slogans, and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed,” he said, according toReuters. “You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully.”\n\nDespite signaling a readiness to sign a deal, Shamkhani expressed frustration with Trump in the Wednesday interview with NBC News.\n\n“He talks about the olive branch, which we have not seen. It’s all barbed wire,” he said.\n\nOpposition from Republicans in Congress could also harm negotiations. On Wednesday, all Republican senators, except Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), signed a letter led by Sens. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) that called on the Trump administration to follow through on its previous “explicit warnings” that Iran “must permanently give up any capacity for enrichment,”according totheJewish Insider.\n\nThe letter appeared to take issue with the deal Witkoff and Shamkhani hinted at.\n\n“You and your administration have therefore correctly drawn a redline against any deal that allows Iran to retain any enrichment capability,” the letter read, referring to previous statements from the administration.\n\n“We cannot afford another agreement that enables Iran to play for time, as the JCPOA did. The Iranian regime should know that the administration has Congressional backing to ensure their ability to enrich uranium is permanently eliminated,” it added.\n\nA nearly identical letter from the House was signed by 177 representatives, or 80% of House Republicans.\n\nAraghchi has said a certain degree of enrichment is nonnegotiable.\n\n“Enrichment is an issue that Iran will not give up, and there is no room for compromise on it,” he said. “However, its dimensions, levels, or amounts might change for a period to allow confidence-building.”\n\nAs Trump increasingly leans toward a deal, cracks are forming in his relationship with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favors military strikes against Iran’s nuclear program, which puts him at odds with Trump.\n\nReports have swirled that Trump and Netanyahu’s relationship has gone cold, with Trump increasingly sidelining Netanyahu in his Middle Eastern dealings. Most recently, the Trump administration struck a deal with the Houthis to cease its bombing campaign in exchange for safe passage of American ships, and it struck a deal with Hamas to release the last American hostage, without Israel’s input.\n\nTrump’s first Middle Eastern tour in his second presidential term has also excluded Israel.\n\n“I think Israel is a bit alarmed that what they expected from President Trump, which was to be extremely supportive, very cooperative, and even malleable, in favor of some of their preferences, is not the President Trump that they are experiencing,” former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapirotold theWashington Examineron Tuesday. “It’s not that he’s not supportive, but he’s made a number of decisions, or at least forecast other decisions that are clearly at odds with their preferences, and sometimes without any consultation.”\n\nIran, meanwhile, finds itself in its worst position in decades. Blistering strikes from Israel last year devastated its proxies and allies across the Middle East, including its primary nonstate ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon, which saw its entire leadership killed in Israeli strikes. The sudden collapse of the allied Assad regime in Syria in December removed its foremost ally in the region.\n\nTRUMP’S TRANSACTIONAL ‘AMERICA FIRST’ POLICY LEAVES ISRAEL UNEASY\n\nIn conjunction with its foreign policy failures is an increasingly dire economic crisis, the longest in Iran’s modern history. Pezeshkian has even said the current economic situation is worse than during the country’s existential war with Iraq in the 1980s.\n\nAnalysts have estimatedthat the economic situation is pushing Tehran to strike a deal with Trump despite its belligerent rhetoric and long-standing distrust."
