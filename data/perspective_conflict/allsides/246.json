        "source_1": "Qatar says strike was ‘horrific massacre’ and the UK calls for end to Israel’s ‘deplorable attacks’, which WHO also condemns.\n\nA predawn Israelistrike on al-Ahli Hospitalin Gaza City, the last major hospital providing critical healthcare in northern Gaza, has sparked condemnation in Palestine and across the world as Israel continues toattack healthcare facilities.\n\nIsrael on Sunday claimed it struck a Hamas command and control centre at the hospital, without providing evidence, while Hamas denied the allegations.\n\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs al-Ahli Hospital, condemned the attack, saying it occurred on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.”\n\nIt said the twin strikes demolished the hospital’s two-storey genetic laboratory and damaged the pharmacy and the emergency department buildings.\n\nThe Higher Presidential Committee for Church Affairs in Palestine, which is affiliated with the Anglican Church, said the attack constituted “a grave violation of religious sanctity and fundamental principles of international humanitarian law”.\n\nThe head of the committee, Ramzi Khoury, asserted that the attack was a direct affront to Palestinian Christians and the global Christian community.\n\nBritain’s Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement on Sunday: “The Anglican-run Ahli Hospital in Gaza is a place of healing and care for Palestinians living through unimaginable suffering. In unbearable conditions, its heroic doctors and nurses have cared for civilians who have endured 18 months of devastating violence”.\n\n“For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem,” he said.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the bombing forced the evacuation of patients and staff. “We call on international institutions and relevant authorities to protect the health sector in accordance with international laws and agreements,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said the “heinous aggression” was “part of a systematic series of attacks targeting hospitals, schools, shelters and tents for the displaced in Gaza, within the context of a systematic war of extermination that violates all humanitarian and moral standards”.\n\nPIJ blamed Israel for sowing panic among patients and staff by issuing a warning shortly before the strike. “The international silence on Gaza is forcing it to become a graveyard for law and humanity,” it added.\n\nHospitals have special protection under international law. Israel has besieged and raided them nevertheless, some several times, and struck multiple ones while accusing Hamas of using them as cover for its fighters. Last month,Israel struck Nasser Hospitalin Khan Younis, the largest hospital in southern Gaza, killing two people and causing a large fire.\n\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service and a child had died as a result of the disruption of care.\n\nThe hospital was also forced to move 50 patients to other health centres, but 40 critical patients could not be moved, Tedros added.\n\n“Attacks on health care must stop,” the WHO chief wrote on X. “Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.”\n\nAl-Ahli hospital in#Gazais out of service following this morning’s evacuation order and attack –@WHOhas received an update from the hospital’s director. A child died due to disruption of care.\n\nThe emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines and the pharmacy…\n\n— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)April 13, 2025\n\nIreland’s Prime Minister Michael Martin also took to X to say he was “appalled by the missile strike on the Al-Ahli hospital,” which left “northern Gaza critically short of emergency care”.\n\n“The wanton killing and targeting of civilians has to end,” he added.\n\nAppalled by the missile strike on the Al-Ahli hospital, leaving northern Gaza critically short of emergency care.\n\nThis is part of a wider and deeply unacceptable development in modern warfare.\n\nThe wanton killing and targeting of civilians has to end.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister David Lammy said Israel’s bombing of medical facilities had “comprehensively degraded access to healthcare” in the enclave.\n\n“Al-Ahli Hospital has been attacked repeatedly since the conflict began. These deplorable attacks must end. Diplomacy not more bloodshed is how we will achieve a lasting peace,” Lammy wrote on X.\n\nQatar said the attack on the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza was a “horrific massacre and a heinous crime against civilians” that constituted a grave violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry warned about the expansion of the cycle of violence across the region and said the international community must assume its responsibilities in protecting civilians.\n\nJordan also condemned the attack as well as Israel’s systematic targeting of civilians in Gaza and the destruction of vital facilities that provide essential services to its population.\n\nEgypt, too, issued a statement, calling the attack a grave violation of international humanitarian law and international norms and appealing for the international community’s intervention in halting the attacks.\n\nBranding it a “heinous crime … [and] flagrant violation of all international laws and norms,” Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack in the “strongest terms”.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock questioned the modalities of the strike but stopped short of condemning the attack. “The cruel Hamas terror must be combated. But international humanitarian law applies, with a special obligation to protect civilian areas. How can a hospital be evacuated in less than 20 minutes?” she asked in a post on X.",
        "source_2": "April 13 (UPI) --A hospital inGazawas intentionally hit by the Israeli military on Palm Sunday prompting widespread condemnations from Christian groups in the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forcesclaimed in a statementSunday that it had dismantled an allegedHamas\"command and control center\" operating inside the al-Ahli Hospital.\n\nWithout publishing evidence, the IDF claimed Hamas fighters used the hospital to \"plan and execute terror attacks\" against Israel. Israel's previous claims that hospitals have been used by Hamashave been refutedby authorities andquestioned by the media.\n\n\"Despite the IDF repeatedly stating that military activity within medical facilities in Gaza must stop, Hamas continues to blatantly violate international law and abuse the civilian population,\" Israel claimed Sunday.\n\nThe hospital is administered by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, a regional diocese of the Anglican Communion representing Anglican and Episcopal Christians across the Middle East. The churchcondemned Israel's attackon the hospital.\n\n\"The twin strikes demolished the two-story genetic laboratory and damaged the pharmacy and the emergency department buildings. It also resulted in other collateral damage to the surrounding buildings, including the church building of St. Philip's,\" the diocese said.\n\nThe diocese said Israel ordered the evacuation of the hospital just 20 minutes before the bombing and that one child who suffered a prior head injury died during the evacuation process.\n\n\"The Diocese of Jerusalem is appalled at the bombing of the hospital now for the fifth time since the beginning of the war in 2023-and this time on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week,\" it said in its statement.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, one of the world's oldest and most important Christian institutions, likewisecondemned the attack.\n\n\"The al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza, a place consecrated to healing and long rooted in the Christian vocation of mercy, was struck by an Israeli air assault that rendered its emergency and other critical departments inoperative,\" the patriarchate said.\n\nThe patriarchate said the hospital \"stood as one of the last beacons of medical hope in Gaza\" while institutions have been \"systematically destroyed.\"\n\n\"Yet even amidst devastation, the light of faith remains unextinguished. In Gaza's Zaytun Quarter, within the heart of the Old City, the historic Church of Saint Porphyrius held Palm Sunday prayers -- quiet, steadfast, and full of grace -- affirming that the witness of Christ's peace endures, even when sorrow surrounds the sanctuary,\" the patriarchate said.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land, which operates in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank,joined in the condemnationsand went further to condemn the \"disastrous blocking of humanitarian aid, especially as we begin Holy Week.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which holds the authority of the Vatican in the Holy Land, has not directly addressed Israel's latest attack, but has longvocalized support for Gaza.\n\nBritish Foreign MinisterDavid Lammyalso decriedIsrael's \"deplorable\" actions and noted Sunday that Israel has \"repeatedly\" attacked the hospital since the war began with such attacks on medical facilities leading to \"degraded access to healthcare in Gaza.\"\n\n\"These deplorable attacks must end,\" Lammy said. \"Diplomacy not more bloodshed is how we will achieve a lasting peace.\"",
        "source_3": "Claiming it held a \"command and control center used by Hamas,\"Israel chose Palm Sunday to bomb the only Christian hospital in war-shattered Gaza.It was also the last fully-functioning hospital in Gaza City. No casualties from the bombing per se were reported by Gaza's civil emergency service. However,a child who'd been hospitalized for a head wound diedfrom \"the rushed evacuation process,\" said the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the al Ahli Arab Hospital. The diocese is part of the Anglican Church.\n\nCiting Gaza Civil Defense,Middle East Eyereports that the bombs resulted in “thedestruction of the surgery building and the oxygen generation station for the intensive care units.”St. Philip's Church was one of multiple nearby buildings that also suffered damage.The IDF attributed the low casualty count to its effort to \"mitigate harm to civiliansor to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance.\"\n\nA local journalist toldBBCthat the IDF called an emergency room doctor and urged the hospital's immediate evacuation, saying \"You have only 20 minutes to leave.\" A previously-injured Khalil Bakr said he and his three wounded daughters --two amputees and a third \"full of platinum plates\"-- managed to get out of the hospital just a couple minutes before destruction rained down.\n\n\"For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling,\"said British Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell in a statement. \"I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation.\"\n\nThe British government joined the condemnation, with Foreign Minister David Lammy saying the\"deplorable attacks must end...Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcarein Gaza.\" Before the attack, the hospital stood alone as the only one still fully functioning in Gaza City, after Israel blew up the Al-Shifa Hospital and others.\n\nTheOrthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalemissued its own statement:\n\n“This hospital, already strained by months of siege, stood as one of the last beacons of medical hope in Gaza, where dozens of healthcare institutions have been systematically destroyed.The stripping away of such sanctuaries of life and dignity is a tragedy that transcends all boundaries of politics and enters the realm of the sacred.”\n\nWhile the British government and many other entities have decried the attack, there's beenno official statement from the Israel-catering Trump administration.\n\nPrevious IDF claims of hospitals being used as Hamas facilities have grownsuspectunder scrutiny, with credible accusations ofthe IDF staging evidencebefore ushering in journalists to see the \"proof.\" Throughout the war that's raged since the Oct 7 Hamas invasion of southern Israel, the IDF has repeatedly bombed medical facilities and fired on ambulances.\n\nOne of the most troubling such incidents came last month, when14 medical and other aid workers were found in a mass grave in Gaza after the IDF destroyed a convoy of ambulances and other first-response vehicles. The IDF originally claimed the vehicles \"were identified advancing suspiciously\" without either their headlights or emergency lights on. Then cell phonevideo of the IDF attackcaptured by one of the slain ambulance crew membersprovedthe IDF account was completely false. The vehicles' headlights and emergency lights were on, and the vehicles carried clear markings of their nature.\n\nAs withering IDF gunfire rakes over the first responders, the dying Palestinian video narrator can be heard reciting the Shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith: \"There is no God but God, Muhammad is his messenger.\" Then, perhaps anticipating the video may be recovered after his murder by Israeli soldiers, he said,“Forgive me, mother. This is the path I chose -- to help people. God is Great.\""
