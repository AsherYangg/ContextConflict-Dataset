    "question": "Should every child have a mobile phone?",

        "source_1": "UNICEF (2020) — “COVID-19: Are children able to continue learning during school closures?”: UNICEF estimated 463 million children could not access remote learning during pandemic school closures due to lack of connectivity or devices. In many low-resource settings, simple mobile phones were among the most available tools for teachers and families to share assignments and communicate, suggesting personal phone access can help sustain learning and reduce equity gaps.",
        "source_2": "Pew Research Center (2023) — “Teens, Social Media and Technology”: Pew reports that most U.S. teens have access to a smartphone, and teens in lower-income households are more likely to rely on smartphones as their primary way to get online when home broadband is absent. This indicates that for many youths, a personal phone is a crucial gateway to information, homework help, and essential services.",
        "source_3": "FEMA Ready.gov (ongoing guidance) — Emergency Communications and Supply Kit Recommendations: U.S. emergency preparedness guidance advises families to plan how they will communicate in disasters and to include a cell phone with chargers/backup battery in supply kits, noting that text messaging may work when calls do not. This supports the safety argument that children old enough to use a phone benefit from personal, reliable access during emergencies.",
        "source_4": "U.S. Surgeon General (2023) — Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health: The advisory warns of significant risks to youth mental health associated with social media exposure, calling for age-appropriate safeguards and limits. Because smartphones are the primary portal to social platforms, this evidence argues for caution about universal, early smartphone access for children.",
        "source_5": "Beland & Murphy (2015) — “Ill Communication: Technology, Distraction & Student Performance” (LSE Centre for Economic Performance): Analyzing school-level smartphone bans in the UK, the study found that removing phones from school led to measurable test score gains, especially for lower-achieving students. This suggests widespread phone availability can impair academic performance during school hours unless tightly regulated.",
        "source_6": "American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (ongoing policy/guidance) — Media Use Guidelines and Family Media Plan: AAP discourages screen media for children under 18 months (except video chat) and recommends structured limits and a family media plan for older children. These age-based guidelines imply that not every child is developmentally ready for personal phone ownership, and decisions should be individualized rather than universal."
