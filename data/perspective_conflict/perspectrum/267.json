    "question": "Are reality TV shows an important part of popular culture today?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Nielsen (2023–2024, U.S. broadcast season rankings). Evidence: Season-to-date and year-end Nielsen ratings consistently place long-running reality/unscripted franchises such as The Voice and Survivor among the most-watched broadcast entertainment programs (non-sports), indicating that reality TV continues to anchor mass-audience, appointment viewing on linear television.",
        "source_2": "Netflix Top 10 (2023–2024, global weekly viewership lists). Evidence: Netflix’s own weekly Top 10 reports repeatedly show reality franchises (e.g., Love Is Blind, The Circle, Too Hot to Handle, Perfect Match) charting among the most-watched English-language TV series worldwide for multiple weeks, demonstrating that reality TV is not only a broadcast staple but also a streaming-era hit genre with global reach.",
        "source_3": "Deloitte, Digital Media Trends 18th Edition (2024). Evidence: Deloitte finds Gen Z and younger Millennials spend more entertainment time with video games and creator-driven social media than with traditional TV and films, suggesting that for younger cohorts, user-generated content and gaming culture often outrank television (including reality TV) in day-to-day cultural centrality—challenging the claim of reality TV’s primacy across all demographics.",
        "source_4": "UK Parliament, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee — “Reality TV” Inquiry (2019) and ensuing Ofcom participant-protection rules. Evidence: The DCMS Committee concluded reality TV’s scale and influence warranted stronger protections for participants, prompting Ofcom to introduce stricter “due care” provisions for reality/factual entertainment. The policy response underscores the genre’s societal impact (and controversies), reinforcing its cultural significance while highlighting harms that complicate its “importance.”",
        "source_5": "Variety and The Hollywood Reporter (2023 strike coverage). Evidence: During the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, U.S. broadcast networks and streamers leaned heavily on unscripted/reality series to fill schedules (e.g., expanding existing franchises, fast-tracking new formats). This strategic reliance underscores reality TV’s economic and operational importance to the industry as a resilient content pillar.",
        "source_6": "Television Academy (Emmy Awards patterns, recent years). Evidence: Reality programs are largely siloed into unscripted categories (e.g., Outstanding Reality Competition Program) and are rarely nominated for top “prestige” awards like Outstanding Drama or Comedy Series. This awards pattern indicates that while reality TV is commercially and socially prominent, it remains marginal in elite critical recognition—casting doubt on its “importance” within high-prestige cultural institutions."
