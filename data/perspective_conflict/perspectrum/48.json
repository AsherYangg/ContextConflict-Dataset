Proves that any universe with a positive average expansion rate cannot be past-eternal, implying a beginning to spacetime—often cited in cosmological arguments that infer a transcendent cause.",

Surveys physics literature showing life-permitting values of constants occupy a very narrow range; framed as evidential support for design by theists, while also outlining naturalistic alternatives (e.g., multiverse, selection effects).",

Presents a Bayesian “cumulative case” that a simple theistic hypothesis best explains a suite of data (existence of a contingent universe, laws of nature, consciousness, moral awareness, and religious experience), yielding a non-negligible posterior probability for God.",

Develops the “hiddenness” argument: the existence of reasonable, nonresistant nonbelievers is surprising on the hypothesis of a perfectly loving God who desires relationship, thus evidencing against theism.",
