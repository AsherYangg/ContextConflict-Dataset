        "source_1": "Congressional Research Service (CRS), “U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians” (R46274). https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46274 - Summarizes U.S. statutory and policy restrictions that limit or bar funding to any Palestinian government that includes designated terrorist organizations (e.g., Hamas), including the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, the Taylor Force Act, and material support prohibitions. Provides the legal/policy rationale often cited by donors for withholding funds under such circumstances.",

Presents evidence that blanket funding bans can harm civilians and undermine governance stability.",

Penn State University Press, 2007. https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03219-1.html - Cross-national analysis finds that post-conflict power-sharing—including the inclusion of former belligerents in government—correlates with more durable peace. Suggests that categorical exclusion of armed actors from governance can impede conflict transformation.",

Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010). https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1498.pdf - Held that even coordinated training and advice to designated terrorist organizations—aimed at nonviolent aims—constitutes prohibited “material support.” Highlights the legal risk that any engagement with a unity government containing an FTO could expose donors and implementers to criminal liability, bolstering arguments for non-funding.",

Offers a democratic legitimacy perspective challenging categorical funding prohibitions."
