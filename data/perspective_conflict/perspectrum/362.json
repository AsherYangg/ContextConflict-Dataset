        "source_1": "Congressional Research Service — “Somalia: Background and U.S. Policy” (author: Lauren Ploch Blanchard; updated 2023–2024). Summarizes how U.S. train‑advise‑assist efforts (notably with Somalia’s Danab Brigade) and targeted strikes have supported Somali-led offensives that retook territory from al‑Shabaab after a 2022–2023 push, citing measurable battlefield gains tied to U.S. enablers.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) — Public release on the Jan. 5, 2020 al‑Shabaab attack at Manda Bay, Kenya (investigation and lessons learned, 2021). Details the lethal attack that killed U.S. servicemembers and contractors and damaged aircraft, underscoring that African militant groups pose direct threats to U.S. personnel and facilities—an argument for sustained U.S. counterterrorism support.",
        "source_3": "Africa Center for Strategic Studies (using ACLED data) — “Militant Islamist Violence in the Sahel: Trajectories” (2023–2024 updates). Documents that, despite years of international counterterrorism assistance (including French and U.S. support), jihadist violence in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger has reached record highs and expanded geographically—evidence that a military‑first external approach has not stabilized the region.",
        "source_4": "Amnesty International — “The Hidden US War in Somalia: Civilian Casualties from Air Strikes in Lower Shabelle” (2019) and follow‑on briefings. Presents field investigations attributing civilian deaths and injuries to U.S. airstrikes, with cases initially denied by officials then partially acknowledged—raising legal, ethical, and strategic concerns (e.g., blowback and recruitment) about U.S. kinetic involvement.",
        "source_5": "United Nations Development Programme — “Journey to Extremism in Africa II: Pathways to Recruitment and Disengagement” (2023). Finds that state abuses, lack of economic opportunity, and governance failures are primary drivers of recruitment; recommends prioritizing rule of law, services, and livelihoods over militarized responses—suggesting U.S. efforts should focus on non‑kinetic support rather than expanded combat operations.",
        "source_6": "The White House — Statement on U.S. Military Support to Somalia (May 16, 2022). Announces a persistent U.S. military presence in Somalia at the request of the Somali government to help degrade al‑Shabaab, highlighting host‑nation consent and regional demand for U.S. assistance as a legitimizing factor for involvement."
