        "source_1": "United Nations General Assembly, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), 2007 — Article 11(2) calls for redress “through restitution, or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation” for cultural, intellectual, religious, and spiritual property taken without free, prior, and informed consent; Article 31 affirms Indigenous peoples’ rights to maintain, control, and protect their cultural heritage and intellectual property. This provides a normative, rights-based foundation for compensation in cases of cultural appropriation.",
        "source_2": "New Zealand Parliament, Haka Ka Mate Attribution Act 2014 — Recognizes Ngāti Toa Rangatira’s ancestral connection to the “Ka Mate” haka and requires attribution in specified uses, but explicitly does not grant property rights or royalties. This legislative model prioritizes recognition and attribution over monetary compensation, offering an alternative remedy to claims for payment.",
        "source_3": "Navajo Nation v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., No. 12-cv-1955 (D.N.M.), settlement announced 2016 — The Navajo Nation sued over the use of “Navajo” on fashion products, alleging trademark infringement and violations of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. The case settled with a licensing and collaboration agreement (financial terms undisclosed), showing that compensation can occur via existing intellectual property and consumer protection laws rather than a standalone cultural appropriation tort.",
        "source_4": "Kenan Malik, “In Defense of Cultural Appropriation,” The New York Times, May 14, 2017 — Argues that cultural borrowing is intrinsic to artistic and social progress, and that policing or monetizing cultural exchange risks ossifying culture, empowering gatekeepers, and chilling creativity. This perspective opposes compensation schemes on normative and free-expression grounds.",
        "source_5": "World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC), ongoing negotiations (2001–present) — Decades-long talks to craft an international legal instrument on traditional cultural expressions highlight unresolved issues: defining beneficiaries, scope, exceptions/limitations, and enforcement. The lack of consensus evidences the practical and legal complexity of designing compensation or benefit-sharing mechanisms for cultural appropriation.",
        "source_6": "Maasai Intellectual Property Initiative (MIPI) / Light Years IP, program reports and media coverage (2010s–present) — A community-led effort to secure licenses for the “Maasai” name and related cultural markers from global brands, generating royalties and agreements that fund community development. This provides an operational model for compensation through collective licensing and benefit-sharing, contrasting with litigation or purely symbolic recognition."
