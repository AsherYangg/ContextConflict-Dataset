    "question": "Should the UN impose sanctions on countries that destroy their rainforests?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "IPCC, Sixth Assessment Report (WGIII, 2022) — The IPCC finds that agriculture, forestry, and other land use account for roughly 13–21% of net anthropogenic GHG emissions (2010–2019), with tropical deforestation a dominant source. It identifies halting deforestation as one of the largest, lowest-cost mitigation options with immediate benefits for climate and biodiversity — evidence often cited to justify strong international measures, potentially including sanctions, to deter rainforest destruction.",
        "source_2": "Security Council Report, “The UN Security Council and Climate Change” (Research Report, 2021) — Reviews debates showing the Council’s reluctance to treat climate and environmental harm as standalone threats to international peace and security. A 2021 draft resolution recognizing climate as a security threat was vetoed, indicating substantial legal-political barriers to adopting UN sanctions aimed primarily at environmental destruction.",
        "source_3": "Nepstad, Stickler, et al., “Slowing Amazon deforestation through public policy and interventions in beef and soy supply chains” (Science, 2014) — Documents that Amazon deforestation in Brazil fell by ~70–80% from 2004 to 2012 due to domestic enforcement, credit restrictions, and private supply-chain agreements (e.g., Soy Moratorium, cattle agreements). Suggests targeted market measures and governance reforms can outperform punitive sanctions in curbing deforestation.",
        "source_4": "IPBES, Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (2019) — Finds that lands managed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities exhibit lower deforestation rates and better biodiversity outcomes, emphasizing rights-based, incentive-focused approaches (e.g., secure land tenure, benefit sharing). Warns that blunt external pressure can produce social harms and perverse incentives, arguing against broad sanctions that could penalize communities.",
        "source_5": "Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg, Economic Sanctions Reconsidered (3rd ed., Peterson Institute, updated studies) — Synthesizes decades of data showing sanctions succeed in changing target behavior only about one-third of the time, with higher humanitarian and economic costs in low- and middle-income countries. Indicates sanctions are a blunt tool that may have limited effectiveness for environmental objectives and risk unintended harms.",
        "source_6": "UN Security Council Resolution 1478 (2003) — Imposed an embargo on Liberian timber because “conflict timber” financed war, demonstrating the Council’s willingness to sanction natural resource sectors when linked to peace and security. Provides a conditional precedent for UN action touching forests, but also underscores that the legal rationale hinged on conflict financing, not environmental protection per se."
