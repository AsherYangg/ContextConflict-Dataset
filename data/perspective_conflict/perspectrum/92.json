        "source_1": "Von Hannover v. Germany (No. 59320/00) — European Court of Human Rights (Judgment, June 24, 2004): The Court held that publishing photos of Princess Caroline of Monaco engaged in everyday activities (outside official duties) violated her right to private life under Article 8, emphasizing the “harassment” effect of constant paparazzi pursuit. This supports the view that paparazzi intrude excessively into celebrities’ lives.",
        "source_2": "“Halle Berry, Jennifer Garner testify for anti-paparazzi bill” — CNN (August 13, 2013): Coverage of California’s SB 606, later enacted to increase penalties for harassing the children of public figures, including photographing or following them because of a parent’s job. The law’s passage reflects legislative recognition that paparazzi practices had become unduly intrusive, especially toward minors.",
        "source_3": "“Framing Britney Spears” — The New York Times Presents (FX/Hulu documentary, February 2021): The film documents how relentless paparazzi pursuit and invasive tabloid coverage coincided with and arguably exacerbated Spears’s mental health struggles, offering concrete case-based evidence of harmful overreach into a celebrity’s private life.",
        "source_4": "“Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades” — The New York Times (October 5, 2017): Investigative reporting into a prominent producer’s (celebrity) misconduct catalyzed accountability and broader #MeToo reforms, illustrating that press scrutiny of powerful public figures can serve substantial public interest rather than constituting undue intrusion.",
        "source_5": "Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 — U.S. Supreme Court (2001): The Court held that the First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information on matters of public concern even when the source obtained it unlawfully, underscoring strong U.S. protections for press reporting and the need to balance privacy claims against public-interest journalism.",
        "source_6": "Editors’ Code of Practice — Independent Press Standards Organisation (UK) (current code): The Code’s Privacy (Clause 2) and Harassment (Clause 3) rules restrict persistent pursuit, intimidation, and photography in private places without consent, indicating that industry standards and oversight mechanisms exist to curb excessive intrusion and provide recourse."
