        "source_1": "National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2016). Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. Conclusion: No substantiated evidence that currently commercialized GE foods are less safe to eat than non-GE foods; human health risks appear comparable to conventional crops. Implication: Weighs against a blanket ban on development. https://nap.edu/23395",

Finding: Herbicide use increased substantially over time, largely due to the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds, raising environmental and resistance-management concerns. Implication: Supports arguments for strong restrictions or a ban. https://doi.org/10.1186/2190-4715-24-24",

Finding: Across 147 studies, GM crops increased yields and farmer profits on average, offering economic and food security benefits, especially for smallholders in developing countries. Implication: Weighs against a blanket ban due to demonstrated socioeconomic gains. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629",

Finding: Reinforces strong corporate IP control over seeds, raising concerns about farmer autonomy, dependency, and equity. Implication: Cited by critics to justify bans or moratoria on GMO development tied to restrictive seed regimes. https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/569/278/",

Finding: Beta-carotene in Golden Rice effectively converts to vitamin A in humans, indicating potential to reduce vitamin A deficiency in vulnerable populations.

Ecological Applications, 15(2): 377–404. Finding: Identifies ecological risks such as transgene flow to wild relatives, potential non-target effects, and resistance evolution; recommends robust, case-by-case ecological risk assessment and monitoring. Implication: Supports precautionary approaches and is used to argue for moratoria or strict limits; some extend this to calls for bans. https://doi.org/10.1890/04-0921"
