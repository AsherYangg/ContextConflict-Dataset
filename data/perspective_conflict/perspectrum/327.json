        "source_1": "Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) and ICF — Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) 2016 (published 2018). Evidence: Women’s reports show husband/partner opposition is a notable reason for nonuse of contraception, and spousal discussion is strongly associated with modern method use. This supports the view that male approval and engagement can be decisive for contraceptive uptake in Uganda.",
        "source_2": "Guttmacher Institute — Adding It Up: Investing in Sexual and Reproductive Health in Uganda (country fact sheet/brief, 2017–2020 series). Evidence: Leading reasons for nonuse among Ugandan women include concerns about side effects/health risks and access/quality barriers (e.g., stockouts, cost, distance), with partner opposition not the dominant driver. The analysis emphasizes strengthening supply chains, method mix, and counseling quality as the primary levers, challenging the idea that men are “the key.”",
        "source_3": "Institute for Reproductive Health, Georgetown University; Pathfinder International; Save the Children — GREAT Project Final Report, Northern Uganda (2015). Evidence: A gender-transformative, community-based intervention engaging adolescent boys, men, and couples increased couple communication and reported modern contraceptive use among newly married and first-time parents compared with controls. This suggests that deliberate male engagement can measurably improve family planning outcomes.",
        "source_4": "Nalwadda G., Mirembe F., Byamugisha J., Faxelid E. — Persistent high fertility in Uganda: Young people recount obstacles and enabling factors to use of contraceptives (BMC Public Health, 2010). Evidence: Qualitative interviews with Ugandan adolescents and young adults highlight stigma, provider attitudes, fear of side effects, and lack of youth-friendly, confidential services as central barriers; partner involvement was often absent or problematic. This indicates that centering male partners may miss a large segment (unmarried youth) and could deter use if confidentiality is compromised.",
        "source_5": "Ministry of Health, Republic of Uganda — Uganda Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan (CIP) 2020–2025. Evidence: The CIP lays out a rights-based, client-centered strategy prioritizing method availability, supply chain reliability, provider training, and youth-friendly services, with male engagement included but not privileged above other pillars. Policy framing implies multiple concurrent determinants of FP uptake rather than men being “the key.”",
        "source_6": "Kabagenyi A., Jennings L., Reid A., Nalwadda G., Ntozi J., Atuyambe L. — Barriers to male involvement in contraceptive uptake and reproductive health services: a qualitative study in rural Uganda (Reproductive Health, 2014). Evidence: Men hold substantial decision-making power over fertility and FP, yet norms, misinformation, and fear of ridicule constrain supportive involvement; women also report male control that can limit their contraceptive choices. The study underscores that while men are influential, relying on them as gatekeepers can reinforce barriers without parallel measures to protect women’s autonomy."
