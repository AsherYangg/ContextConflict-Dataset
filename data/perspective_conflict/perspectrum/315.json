        "source_1": "Office for Budget Responsibility (March 2023), Economic and Fiscal Outlook — Box on Brexit and trade. Link: https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-march-2023/ Key finding: OBR assumes UK trade intensity will be around 15% lower in the long run than if the UK had remained in the EU, implying a roughly 4% reduction in long-run productivity and GDP relative to staying in the EU. Perspective: Opposes the claim (projects a lasting economic cost from being outside the EU).",

Link: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/solvency-ii-reforms-to-boost-growth-and-level-up-the-uk Key point: The government argues post-Brexit regulatory autonomy enables “Solvency UK” reforms expected to unlock up to £100 billion in long-term investment by insurers into UK infrastructure and productive assets. Perspective: Supports the claim (regulatory freedom outside the EU can deliver investment and growth benefits).",

Link: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/bulletins/uktradeinservices/2023 Key finding: UK services exports and the services trade surplus reached record highs in 2023, with strong performance in financial, business and other knowledge-intensive services. Perspective: Supports the claim (post-Brexit the UK’s services-led economy has shown resilience/strength in external markets).",

Link: https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit10.pdf Key finding: New post-Brexit trade barriers increased UK food prices by about 6% over 2020–2021, raising the cost of living for households. Perspective: Opposes the claim (higher trade costs outside the EU have raised consumer prices).",
        "source_5": "UK Government (Department for Business and Trade, 2023), CPTPP: Impact Assessment. Link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cptpp-impact-assessment Key finding: Accession to CPTPP is estimated to raise UK GDP by around 0.08% in the long run; new post-Brexit trade deals deliver gains but they are modest compared with losses estimated from leaving the EU single market. Perspective: Opposes the claim (available trade-policy gains outside the EU appear too small to outweigh estimated costs).",

Link: https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/uktpo/publications/not-backing-britain-fdi-in-the-uk-after-the-brexit-referendum/ Key finding: The referendum result is associated with about a 19% drop in new greenfield FDI projects relative to a no-Brexit counterfactual. Perspective: Opposes the claim (reduced foreign investment weakens growth prospects outside the EU)."
