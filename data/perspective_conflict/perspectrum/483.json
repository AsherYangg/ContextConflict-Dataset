        "source_1": "African Union, Master Roadmap of Practical Steps to Silence the Guns in Africa by the Year 2020 (adopted 2016; endorsed Jan 2017). The AU laid out a concrete plan to meet the 2020 pledge: strengthen the African Peace and Security Architecture (including the African Standby Force, Continental Early Warning System, Panel of the Wise), tackle illicit arms flows and governance drivers, and self-finance peace operations via a 0.2% import levy to capitalize a $400m Peace Fund. This blueprint and financing model present a pathway suggesting the goal could be achievable if fully implemented.",
        "source_2": "Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), Africa conflict trend reports (2019–2020). ACLED data show sharp escalation of violence in the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger), a surging insurgency in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado, persistent war in Libya, and the outbreak of large-scale conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray in late 2020—evidence that the continent was moving away from, not toward, “ending all war” by 2020.",
        "source_3": "African Union Assembly, 14th Extraordinary Session on Silencing the Guns, Decision Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1(XIV) (6 December 2020). The Assembly extended the “Silencing the Guns” horizon from 2020 to 2030, effectively acknowledging the 2020 target was not met and recalibrating timelines—direct evidence against the claim.",
        "source_4": "Case studies of AU/REC conflict management successes (2017–2019): ECOWAS/AU/UN action in The Gambia (2017) averted potential civil conflict; AU- and IGAD-supported Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (2018) reduced large-scale battles through 2019; AU/IGAD mediation helped broker Sudan’s 2019 political agreement; the 2018 Ethiopia–Eritrea rapprochement ended a decades-long interstate standoff. These outcomes illustrate that African-led diplomacy and security mechanisms can rapidly de-escalate crises, supporting the plausibility of the 2020 ambition under favorable conditions.",
        "source_5": "Institute for Security Studies (ISS), PSC Report: “Is ‘Silencing the Guns by 2020’ realistic?” (2017) and subsequent ISS analyses (2019). Expert assessments argued the goal was unattainable on the original timeline due to structural obstacles—member-state sovereignty constraints, under-capitalized AU Peace Fund, dependence on external donors, transnational jihadist and criminal networks, weak governance and security sectors, and climate/resource stresses—factors beyond what AU mechanisms could overcome by 2020.",
        "source_6": "United Nations Security Council, Resolution 2457 (2019), Cooperation between the UN and the AU on “Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020” (27 February 2019). The UNSC unanimously endorsed the AU initiative, urging stronger AU–UN coordination, arms embargo enforcement, and sanctions on spoilers. This high-level international backing bolstered the initiative’s prospects and provided tools that, in principle, could have helped the AU meet its pledge."
