        "source_1": "Gerber, Elisabeth R., and Rebecca B. Morton. “Primary Election Systems and Representation.” American Journal of Political Science, 1998. Finding: Using U.S. House data, the authors conclude that legislators from open-primary states tend to adopt more moderate positions than those from closed-primary states, suggesting open primaries can incentivize candidates to appeal to a broader electorate.",
        "source_2": "McGhee, Eric; Masket, Seth E.; Shor, Boris; Rogers, Steven; McCarty, Nolan. “A Primary Cause of Partisanship? Nomination Systems and Legislator Ideology.” American Journal of Political Science, 2014. Finding: Across multiple states and time, variation in primary rules (open vs. closed) shows little to no systematic effect on legislator ideology or polarization, challenging the claim that open primaries are especially effective at producing moderate or representative nominees.",
        "source_3": "Alvarez, R. Michael, and Jonathan Nagler. “The Likely Consequences of Crossover Voting in Presidential Primaries.” PS: Political Science & Politics, 2002. Finding: Analysis of survey data indicates that while crossover voting occurs in open primaries, strategic “raiding” is uncommon; most crossover voters express sincere preferences, undermining a common critique that open primaries are easily manipulated.",
        "source_4": "California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567 (2000). Finding: The U.S. Supreme Court struck down California’s blanket primary as an unconstitutional burden on parties’ associational rights, a decision frequently cited by critics who argue that opening nominations to nonmembers can dilute party brands and reduce parties’ ability to select standard-bearers aligned with their platforms.",
        "source_5": "Jones, Jeffrey M. “U.S. Party Affiliation in 2023.” Gallup, 2023. Finding: Gallup reports that about 43% of Americans identify as political independents, a near-record share; proponents argue open primaries are more effective at enfranchising this large group in candidate selection compared with closed systems that exclude them.",
        "source_6": "Cohen, Marty; Karol, David; Noel, Hans; Zaller, John. The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Finding: The authors show that party elite endorsements and networks powerfully shape nominations; advocates of stronger party-centered selection infer that mechanisms emphasizing party choice (rather than open participation) may yield nominees who are more viable and coherent with party platforms than those emerging from open primaries."
