    "question": "Should Braille be protected out of respect for free speech?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), Article 21. Establishes that freedom of expression and access to information for persons with disabilities requires states to “accept and facilitate” the use of Braille and other accessible formats—framing Braille as integral to exercising free speech and the right to receive information.",
        "source_2": "Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the First Amendment protects the right of the public to receive information, not just the right to speak—supporting the view that ensuring accessible modalities like Braille is part of safeguarding free speech for blind readers.",
        "source_3": "National Federation of the Blind (2009), “The Braille Literacy Crisis in America.” Reports that a small share of blind students are taught Braille while Braille literacy is strongly correlated with employment among blind adults; used to argue Braille is essential for true literacy (spelling, grammar) and thus for meaningful expressive and receptive speech.",
        "source_4": "NPR (Joseph Shapiro, 2009), “In A High-Tech World, Braille No Longer A Necessity?” Highlights a contrasting perspective that advances in audio technologies (screen readers, audiobooks) can meet many access needs, leading some educators and users to deprioritize Braille—questioning whether protecting Braille is uniquely necessary for free speech.",
        "source_5": "National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361 (2018), and Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626 (1985). These cases outline limits on compelled speech and allow only factual, uncontroversial disclosures in commercial contexts; they suggest that broad Braille mandates framed as speech requirements could face First Amendment scrutiny, complicating a pure “free speech” rationale.",
        "source_6": "2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, §703 (U.S.). Requires tactile (including Braille) signage for permanent rooms and spaces in public accommodations, grounding Braille protections in disability anti-discrimination law rather than free speech—offering a competing view that the correct legal basis is civil rights/accessibility, not the First Amendment."
