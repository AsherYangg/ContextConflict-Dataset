        "source_1": "Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), “Summary of the Reengagement of Detainees Formerly Held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba” (various updates; e.g., 2016–2017). ODNI reported a significant percentage of transferred detainees were confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorism after release, a risk-based argument sometimes cited to justify continued detention without trial for high-risk suspects.",
        "source_2": "Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004). The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that, under the law of war and the 2001 AUMF, the government may detain enemy combatants without criminal trial for the duration of hostilities, while also requiring a meaningful opportunity to challenge that status before a neutral decision-maker—supporting limited detention without trial in wartime.",
        "source_3": "Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723 (2008). The U.S. Supreme Court held that noncitizen detainees at Guantánamo have a constitutional privilege of habeas corpus, and that Congress could not strip courts of jurisdiction to review their detention—constraining indefinite detention without meaningful judicial review.",
        "source_4": "UK Ministry of Defence, “Operation Banner: An Analysis of Military Operations in Northern Ireland” (2006). The official review concludes that the 1971 policy of internment without trial (Operation Demetrius) was counterproductive, increased support for the Provisional IRA, and worsened the security situation—evidence that detention without trial can backfire strategically.",
        "source_5": "Seth G. Jones and Martin C. Libicki, “How Terrorist Groups End: Lessons for Countering al Qa’ida,” RAND Corporation (2008). An empirical study finding that most terrorist groups end via policing and intelligence or political processes, with conventional military approaches playing a smaller role—suggesting criminal-justice-led strategies (including trials) are generally more effective than extrajudicial detention.",
        "source_6": "UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 35 on ICCPR Article 9 (2014) and General Comment No. 29 on States of Emergency (2001). These authoritative interpretations state that arbitrary or indefinite detention is prohibited; even in emergencies, detention must be strictly necessary, proportionate, and subject to prompt judicial control—placing stringent international-law limits on detention without trial."
