Finding: During peak operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 200,000 contractor personnel were deployed and at times outnumbered U.S. troops; DoD cited surge capacity, specialized skills, and flexibility as reasons contractors were “integral” to achieving operational objectives.

Evidence: Affirms that using PMCs is not per se unlawful under international law and sets out best practices and state responsibilities, providing a legitimacy framework for states (including the U.S.) to employ PMCs abroad when properly regulated.

Evidence: Details the Nisour Square incident in Baghdad (2007), where Blackwater contractors killed 17 civilians; despite later criminal convictions, HRW highlights enduring accountability gaps and risks of civilian harm when lethal force is outsourced, challenging the justification for PMC use.

Argument: Privatizing coercive power can erode democratic accountability and civil-military control by shifting force to market logics and diffuse oversight chains, creating incentives misaligned with public objectives—an argument against the normative justification for U.S. reliance on PMCs.
