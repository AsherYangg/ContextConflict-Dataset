    "question": "Should Britain give up its EU rebate?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "European Commission – “The UK correction (rebate) explained” factsheet (circa 2014–2015). Presents the rebate’s mechanics and financing, noting that other member states—including poorer, post-2004 entrants—co-finance the UK’s abatement, and that multiple “corrections to the correction” (reduced financing shares for Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria) create perceived inequities. Argues that phasing out corrections would make contributions fairer and the system more stable—evidence in favor of giving up the rebate.",
        "source_2": "HM Treasury – European Union Finances (annual reports, e.g., 2014/2015). Provides audited figures showing the UK rebate reduced the gross contribution by roughly £4–5 billion per year in the mid-2010s, while the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (a large share of spending) disproportionately benefits other countries. Concludes the rebate remains essential to prevent the UK from becoming a significantly larger net contributor without commensurate return—evidence against giving up the rebate.",
        "source_3": "House of Lords EU Committee – “The Future Financing of the European Union” (2007–2008 inquiry/report). Reviews the 2005 deal where the UK agreed to disapply part of the rebate to spending in new member states (costing several billion pounds over 2007–2013) in expectation of CAP reform; finds that substantive CAP reform did not materialize. Recommends not surrendering more of the rebate without binding expenditure reform—historical evidence cautioning against giving it up.",
        "source_4": "Centre for European Reform (policy brief/commentary). Argues the UK’s insistence on the rebate has high political costs: it brands Britain as an “awkward partner,” impedes coalition-building, and crowds out negotiations on higher-value goals (e.g., deeper Single Market in services, research, and security cooperation). Posits that trading the rebate for strategic concessions could yield greater long-run gains—evidence supporting giving up the rebate for influence.",
        "source_5": "European Court of Auditors – Opinions/Annual Reports on the EU “own resources” system (e.g., Opinion No. 2/2012). Criticizes correction mechanisms (including the UK rebate) for adding complexity, opacity, and error risk to revenue collection and budgeting. Suggests a simpler, more transparent GNI-based system with minimal or no corrections would improve accountability—evidence that ending the rebate would enhance transparency, though implying system-wide reform rather than unilateral UK action."
