    "question": "Should we employ mercenaries?",

        "source_1": "Congressional Research Service — Moshe Schwartz and Joyprada Swain, “Department of Defense Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan: Background and Analysis” (2011). Finding: Contractors often comprised over half of the deployed DoD workforce in those theaters, providing critical logistics, security, and training capacity. Perspective: Pro-necessity; large-scale operations would have been difficult or impossible at then-current troop levels without private military/security contractors.",
        "source_2": "United Nations, International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries (1989) and the Montreux Document (2008). Finding: International law places strict prohibitions on mercenaries and outlines state obligations and best practices regarding private security companies; many states have not ratified the convention and definitions differ. Perspective: Legal/constraints; employing “mercenaries” can trigger compliance, sovereignty, and legitimacy problems depending on definitions and ratification status.",
        "source_3": "International Peacekeeping — Kevin A. O’Brien, “PMCs in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Executive Outcomes” (1998). Finding: Executive Outcomes rapidly reversed battlefield losses in Sierra Leone in the mid-1990s, improving security sufficiently to enable political processes when state and international efforts faltered. Perspective: Pro-effectiveness; a historical case where hiring a private force produced quick, decisive gains.",
        "source_4": "Human Rights Watch, “Q&A: The Blackwater/Nisour Square Case” (updated summaries of the 2007 incident and subsequent legal actions). Finding: Blackwater contractors killed 17 civilians in Baghdad’s Nisour Square; the episode led to intense backlash, prosecutions, and long-term damage to U.S. credibility. Perspective: Accountability/risks; outsourcing force can produce grave human-rights violations and strategic blowback.",
        "source_5": "Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, Final Report “Transforming Wartime Contracting: Controlling Costs, Reducing Risks” (2011). Finding: Estimated $31–$60 billion lost to waste and fraud in contingency contracting; oversight and accountability gaps were systemic. Perspective: Cost/efficiency critique; reliance on contractors can be financially wasteful and undermine mission outcomes.",
        "source_6": "Deborah Avant, The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatizing Security (Cambridge University Press, 2005). Finding: Governments use private military and security firms to gain flexibility and reduce domestic political costs, but this can erode democratic control and strategic coherence. Perspective: Political trade-off; leaders may feel compelled to employ private force for expediency, yet the long-term governance costs challenge the “have to” claim."
