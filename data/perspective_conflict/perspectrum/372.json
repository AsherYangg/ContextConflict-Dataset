        "source_1": "International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IMF-facilitated) and IFSWF, “Sovereign Wealth Funds: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (Santiago Principles)” (2008); IFSWF implementation reviews (2018–2023). Evidence: A widely adopted voluntary code has improved disclosure, governance, and risk management across dozens of SWFs, suggesting self-regulation and transparency standards can address many concerns without new statutory restrictions.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Congress/Treasury, Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) and CFIUS Regulations (2018–2020). Evidence: The U.S. expanded national-security screening to cover non-controlling investments in critical technology, infrastructure, and sensitive data, explicitly capturing state-backed investors such as SWFs; this demonstrates a legislative view that formal regulation is necessary to mitigate security risks from sovereign capital.",
        "source_3": "Kotter, J. and Lel, U., “Friends or Foes? The Stock Price Impact of Sovereign Wealth Fund Investments and the Price of Keeping Secrets,” Journal of Financial Economics (2011). Evidence: Public firms receiving SWF investments experience positive announcement returns and SWFs typically take minority, passive stakes—indicating primarily financial (not political) motives; this supports arguments against sweeping restrictions that might deter beneficial, patient capital.",
        "source_4": "Congressional Research Service, “Sovereign Wealth Funds: Background and Policy Issues for Congress” (2008). Evidence: During the 2007–09 crisis, SWFs injected capital into major Western banks (e.g., ADIA–Citigroup, GIC–UBS, KIA–Merrill Lynch), acting as counter-cyclical stabilizers; this suggests that open regimes enabling SWF participation can bolster financial stability in stress periods.",
        "source_5": "U.S. Treasury OFAC, Press Release designating the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and affiliates (February 2022). Evidence: A sovereign wealth fund was sanctioned for serving as a vehicle for the Kremlin’s agenda, illustrating how SWFs can be instruments of state policy and supporting the case for stringent oversight or restrictions in sensitive sectors.",
        "source_6": "European Commission, “Annual Report on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union” (latest editions 2022–2024). Evidence: Most screened FDI cases (including state-backed/SWF investors) are cleared, often with conditions, and prohibitions are rare—indicating that targeted, proportionate screening can address security concerns without broadly shutting out sovereign capital."
