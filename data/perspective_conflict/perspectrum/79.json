        "source_1": "Haaretz (Uri Blau), “IDF planned to assassinate West Bank militants despite court ruling” (November 2008). Publishes IDF orders, signed by then–Central Command chief Maj.-Gen. Yair Naveh, indicating plans to kill suspects even when arrest was feasible—apparently contravening the Israeli High Court’s limits on targeted killings—supporting the public-interest rationale for the leak.",
        "source_2": "Israeli High Court of Justice, HCJ 769/02 Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v. Government of Israel (judgment of 11 December 2006). Establishes that targeted killings may be lawful only under strict, case-by-case necessity, when capture isn’t possible and with post-action review—providing the legal benchmark the leaked documents suggested the IDF was violating.",
        "source_3": "The New York Times (Isabel Kershner), “Israeli Court Sentences Soldier in Leaks Case” (Oct. 31, 2011). Reports Kamm’s 4.5-year sentence for aggravated espionage and cites the court and security officials’ view that the mass removal of classified files caused serious harm to national security—arguing against any whistleblower justification.",
        "source_4": "Committee to Protect Journalists, “Israel must drop charges against Haaretz journalist Uri Blau” (May 30, 2012). Warns that prosecuting the reporter who used Kamm’s documents chills investigative journalism and undermines accountability in security affairs—framing the leak as serving a legitimate public-interest function.",
        "source_5": "BBC News, “Israeli ex-soldier Anat Kamm jailed for leaking secrets” (Oct. 31, 2011). Details that Kamm copied roughly 2,000 documents, including hundreds marked secret or top secret, during her service; prosecutors said this indiscriminate haul endangered agents and operations—evidence used to argue the leak far exceeded targeted whistleblowing."
