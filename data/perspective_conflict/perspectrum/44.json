Argues that children have rights to access information, participation, and association online; protection measures (like age assurance) should not result in blanket exclusion from digital spaces. Implication: allowing accounts with strong safeguards respects children’s rights while mitigating risks. Source: UN CRC, General comment No. 25, 2021 (CRC/C/GC/25).",

Cautions that social media use is associated with risks including depression, anxiety, body-image issues, sleep disruption, and cyberbullying; early adolescence is a particularly vulnerable developmental period. Implication: children should not be presumed safe on platforms like Facebook; restrictions or delayed access may be warranted. Source: Office of the U.S. Surgeon General, May 2023.",
        "source_3": "Legal framework: COPPA and GDPR age limits. In the U.S., COPPA prohibits collecting personal data from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent; Facebook’s terms set a minimum age of 13. In the EU, GDPR Article 8 sets a default “digital consent” age of 16 (member states may lower to 13–16), meaning many under-16s cannot lawfully hold standard accounts without parental consent. Implication: “allowing” children to have Facebook accounts conflicts with existing law unless robust consent and protections are in place. Sources: COPPA (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506; FTC COPPA Rule), GDPR Article 8.",
        "source_4": "Ofcom — Children and parents: media use and attitudes report (2023). Finds that a substantial share of UK children below platform age limits are already using social media (e.g., around a third of 5–7-year-olds and many 8–11s report social media use or profiles), often by misrepresenting age. Implication: outright bans are frequently evaded; creating supervised, age-appropriate access may reduce covert, riskier use. Source: Ofcom, 2023.",
        "source_5": "Pew Research Center — Teens, Social Media and Technology (2022) and related findings. Most U.S. teens report social media helps them feel more connected to friends and supported during tough times; many cite avenues for creativity and community, though some report negative experiences. Implication: prohibiting access may remove psychosocial and social capital benefits that become salient even in early adolescence. Sources: Pew Research Center, 2022–2023.",
        "source_6": "American Psychological Association — Health Advisory on Social Media Use in Adolescence (2023). Concludes that social media is not inherently beneficial or harmful; outcomes depend on developmental maturity, design features, and context. Recommends age-appropriate design, content controls, digital literacy training, and active parental oversight to reduce risks. Implication: allowing accounts can be appropriate if coupled with strong guardrails and platform responsibilities. Source: APA, 2023."
