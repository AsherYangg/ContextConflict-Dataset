        "source_1": "World Health Organization (2023) — WHO guideline: Policies to protect children from the harmful impact of food marketing. Recommends comprehensive restrictions on child-directed marketing techniques, including the use of toys/premiums with meals, because such incentives exploit children’s developmental vulnerabilities and increase preferences, requests, and consumption of high-fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) foods. Supports prohibitions or strict nutrition-criteria-based limits.",
        "source_2": "UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health (Fast Food FACTS 2021) — Report documents that fast-food companies heavily use toy premiums and cross-promotions to target young children, that these incentives drive “pester power” and requests for restaurant visits, and that most kids’ meal combinations still fail to meet expert nutrition standards. Provides empirical marketing and nutrition data underpinning calls for restricting toy tie-ins.",
        "source_3": "NPR News (2011) — “McDonald’s Bypasses San Francisco’s Happy Meal Toy Ban.” After San Francisco passed an ordinance restricting free toys in kids’ meals that failed nutrition criteria, McDonald’s complied by charging 10 cents per toy and donating proceeds to charity, illustrating how narrow toy bans can be circumvented and may yield limited nutritional changes without broader, enforceable rules.",
        "source_4": "McDonald’s Corporation (2018) — Global Happy Meal Goals announcement with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Commits to reformulating Happy Meals (calorie, added sugar, sodium reductions), featuring water/milk as default beverages, and improving marketing practices; presented by industry as evidence that voluntary standards and healthier defaults—not outright toy prohibitions—can improve kids’ meal nutrition while preserving consumer choice.",
        "source_5": "Reason Magazine (2010) — Editorial on San Francisco’s toy restrictions argues bans are paternalistic “nanny state” policies that substitute regulators’ judgment for parents’, impose unnecessary limits on businesses, and are unlikely to meaningfully affect childhood obesity relative to education and parental responsibility. Presents a consumer choice and libertarian critique of prohibition.",
        "source_6": "PLOS Medicine (2020) — Taillie et al., evaluations of Chile’s Law of Food Labeling and Advertising. Findings show that a comprehensive package—warning labels plus stringent restrictions on child-directed marketing techniques (including toys/characters)—was associated with significant reductions in children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing and declines in purchases of high-sugar products. Suggests toy restrictions can be effective when part of broader, well-enforced policy."
