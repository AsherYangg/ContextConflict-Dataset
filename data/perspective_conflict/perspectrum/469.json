    "question": "Should the West invade Syria?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "UN Human Rights Council, Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic; OPCW Fact-Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mechanism reports — Document extensive war crimes and repeated chemical weapons use in Syria, which advocates say strengthens the humanitarian-responsibility argument that only decisive military action by capable Western forces could protect civilians and enforce the global chemical weapons norm.",
        "source_2": "Chatham House (Royal Institute of International Affairs), legal analysis on the use of force in Syria — Explains that, under the UN Charter, a Western invasion absent UN Security Council authorization or a valid self-defense claim would be unlawful; “Responsibility to Protect” is a political commitment, not an independent legal basis for invading, thus arguing against invasion.",
        "source_3": "Brookings Institution policy papers (e.g., Michael O’Hanlon on “safe zones”/“deconstructing Syria”) — Contend that limited Western ground deployments to establish and hold protected enclaves could reduce civilian harm and create leverage for a settlement, presenting a conditional, operational case for a narrowly scoped incursion.",
        "source_4": "U.S. Department of Defense accounts and major media reporting on the 2018 Battle of Khasham (Deir ez-Zor) involving Russian Wagner contractors — Highlight that Syria hosts Russian and Iranian forces; prior direct clashes underscore serious escalation risks, suggesting a broader Western invasion could trigger great‑power confrontation.",
        "source_5": "Brown University’s Costs of War Project and RAND analyses of Iraq and Libya interventions — Find that large-scale interventions and regime change often produce long-term instability, insurgency, heavy civilian tolls, and high financial costs, cautioning that an invasion of Syria could replicate these adverse outcomes.",
        "source_6": "International Crisis Group reports on ISIS detention camps (al‑Hol/Roj) and security vacuums in northeast Syria — Warn that persistent governance and security gaps risk jihadist resurgence; some analysts interpret this as evidence that a more robust on‑the‑ground international effort (potentially including Western troops) is needed to stabilize the area and prevent renewed transnational threats."
