These official reports track court-authorized wiretaps in the U.S., consistently showing that most intercepts target narcotics offenses and that intercepted communications are regularly used to secure arrests and convictions—evidence of prosecutorial value when admissible. https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/wiretap-reports",
        "source_2": "UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016, Section 56 — Statutory ban on using intercept material as evidence. UK law generally renders “intercepted” communications inadmissible in criminal proceedings, reflecting a policy judgment that courtroom use risks exposing sensitive capabilities, sources, and methods, and imposes onerous disclosure burdens. https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/25/section/56",

An advisory group of Privy Counsellors concluded that intercept evidence could, in principle, be introduced into UK courts under a carefully designed legal model with safeguards, potentially delivering substantial benefits in prosecuting serious crime and terrorism—arguing for conditional admissibility.

        "source_4": "European Court of Human Rights, Khan v. The United Kingdom, no. 35394/97 (2000). The Court found a violation of privacy (Article 8) due to inadequate regulation but held that admitting the covertly obtained recording did not render the trial unfair (no violation of Article 6). This supports the view that human-rights law does not impose a per se exclusionary rule; admissibility can be compatible with a fair trial. https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-58838",

The Grand Chamber held Russia’s interception regime violated Article 8 due to systemic lack of safeguards and oversight, highlighting risks of abuse and chilling effects—underscoring arguments against admitting intercepted material absent robust, enforceable protections. https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-159324",
