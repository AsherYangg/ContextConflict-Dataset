        "source_1": "Bellet, B. W., Jones, P. J., & McNally, R. J. (2018). “Trigger warning: Empirical evidence ahead.” Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry. In randomized experiments, trigger warnings did not reduce participants’ immediate distress or avoidance when reading disturbing passages and offered, at best, trivial benefits. This challenges the claim that content warnings achieve their intended protective effects.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Center for PTSD. “Coping with Triggers” (web resource). Describes how sensory or situational cues can provoke intense reactions in trauma survivors and recommends preparation and planning to manage exposure. This supports content warnings as an accessibility tool that lets readers anticipate, prepare for, or opt out of triggering material.",
        "source_3": "Organization for Transformative Works (Archive of Our Own). “Archive Warnings and Tags” (policy/FAQ). AO3’s standardized warnings (e.g., Graphic Depictions of Violence, Major Character Death, Rape/Non-Con, Underage) and robust tagging/filtering are used at massive scale by millions of users to avoid unwanted content without restricting publication. This demonstrates a feasible, user-controlled model for content warnings.",
        "source_4": "American Library Association. “Labeling and Rating Systems: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights.” The ALA cautions that affixing warning or rating labels to library materials is prejudicial and can function as a form of censorship by discouraging access. This weighs against mandatory content warnings in book contexts on intellectual freedom grounds.",
        "source_5": "Ellis, Danika. “Do You Want Content Warnings in Books? We Asked; You Answered.” Book Riot (reader survey/feature). Reports that a majority of surveyed readers preferred content notes to make informed choices, with many favoring spoiler-minimizing approaches (e.g., placing notes at the back or on publisher websites). This indicates meaningful consumer demand for content warnings if implemented thoughtfully.",
        "source_6": "Gaiman, Neil. Introduction to “Trigger Warning: Short Fictions and Disturbances” (2015). Gaiman reflects that stories are sometimes meant to unsettle and that preemptive labels can shape expectations or flatten art into checklists. This articulates an artistic concern that content warnings may constrain creative aims or diminish the experience."
