    "question": "Should the US immediately close Guantanamo Bay?",

        "source_1": "UN Human Rights Experts, “Guantánamo Bay: 21 years of arbitrary detention is an affront to the rule of law—close it,” Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 11 Jan 2023. Evidence: UN Special Rapporteurs stated that ongoing indefinite detention without fair trial, past torture, and inadequate medical care at Guantánamo violate international law and urged immediate closure and reparations—arguing the facility’s continued operation undermines human rights and the rule of law.",
        "source_2": "Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), “Summary of the Reengagement of Detainees Formerly Held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,” Semiannual Report to Congress (e.g., as of Dec. 31, 2022). Evidence: ODNI reports a measurable rate of confirmed and suspected reengagement in terrorism or insurgency among released detainees (with markedly lower rates for post-2009 transfers), highlighting a national-security risk that opponents of immediate closure cite when arguing for caution and stringent transfer conditions.",
        "source_3": "National Defense Authorization Act for FY2024, transfer and closure restrictions (Title X detainee provisions). Evidence: Congress continues to prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantánamo detainees to the United States and to close the detention facility, creating a legal barrier that makes “immediate” closure infeasible absent new legislation—regardless of policy preferences.",
        "source_4": "U.S. Department of Defense, “Plan for Closing the Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility,” transmitted to Congress, Feb 2016. Evidence: DoD concluded that closing Guantánamo and relocating detainees to a secure stateside facility would better protect national security, reduce long-term costs (given Guantánamo’s extraordinarily high per-capita expenses), and remove a propaganda liability—supporting the case for closure on strategic and fiscal grounds.",
        "source_5": "Human Rights First, “Myth v. Fact: Trying Terrorism Suspects in Federal Courts” (periodically updated). Evidence: Compiles data showing hundreds of successful terrorism prosecutions in Article III courts, contrasted with the military commissions’ minimal and often legally unstable convictions; advocates that moving cases to federal courts is both feasible and more effective—bolstering arguments to close Guantánamo and rely on proven civilian justice mechanisms.",
        "source_6": "Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004). Evidence: The Supreme Court held that the 2001 AUMF permits detention of enemy combatants for the duration of hostilities (with due process safeguards). While not mandating Guantánamo, this precedent is cited to justify continued law-of-war detention for some individuals and to argue that closure could complicate legally authorized detention options."
