Environmental Research Letters. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 - Evidence: Finds that having fewer children is among the highest-impact individual actions to reduce lifetime carbon emissions. Relevance: Supports the claim by suggesting that reducing births can materially lower future emissions, a key global policy objective for climate mitigation.",
        "source_2": "United Nations (ICPD Programme of Action, 1994) — UNFPA. International Conference on Population and Development: Programme of Action. https://www.unfpa.org/publications/international-conference-population-and-development-programme-action - Evidence: Establishes that reproductive decisions must be voluntary and free of coercion; coercive population policies violate internationally recognized human rights. Relevance: Opposes the claim by indicating a universal one‑child mandate would conflict with binding global norms on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights.",
        "source_3": "United Nations, DESA (2022). World Population Prospects 2022. https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/world-population-prospects-2022 - Evidence: Reports that about two-thirds of the world’s population already lives in countries with below‑replacement fertility and highlights rapid population aging (65+ rising from 10% in 2022 to 16% by 2050). Relevance: Warns that a global one‑child rule would accelerate labor-force shrinkage and old‑age dependency in many countries, undermining economic sustainability and pension systems.",

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0602203103 - Evidence: Documents how China’s one‑child era, combined with son preference, led to highly skewed sex ratios and long‑term social consequences (e.g., “missing women,” surplus bachelors, trafficking risks). Relevance: Highlights serious unintended harms that a one‑child policy can produce, especially where gender bias exists.",

The Lancet. https://www.thelancet.com/series/sexual-and-reproductive-health - Evidence: Shows that rights‑based, voluntary family planning (education, contraceptive access) has driven rapid fertility declines and health gains in countries like Bangladesh and Iran without coercion. Relevance: Presents an effective alternative to a one‑child mandate, achieving similar population goals while respecting rights.",

PNAS. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004581107 - Evidence: Modeling suggests that slower population growth can reduce emissions by a notable margin by mid‑century, but impacts vary by region and interact with aging and consumption patterns. Relevance: Offers a nuanced view—population policies can aid climate goals, yet blanket one‑child rules are neither necessary nor efficient compared with targeted, context‑specific, and voluntary approaches."
