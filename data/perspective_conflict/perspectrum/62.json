        "source_1": "U.S. Department of State — Hillary Rodham Clinton, “Remarks on Internet Freedom” (Jan. 21, 2010). In a major policy speech, the Secretary of State framed support for tools that help citizens “circumvent politically motivated censorship” as a pillar of U.S. foreign policy, signaling official endorsement of anti-censorship assistance as legitimate statecraft.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Department of the Treasury — Press Release: “Treasury Issues Iran General License D-2 to Expand Internet Freedom in Iran” (Sept. 23, 2022). The United States modified sanctions to explicitly allow export of communications and circumvention technologies to Iran during protests, presenting anti-censorship assistance as a lawful, purposeful foreign policy instrument to protect the free flow of information.",
        "source_3": "United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression (David Kaye) — Report on encryption and anonymity (A/HRC/29/32, May 2015). The report concludes that states should promote and protect encryption, anonymity, and circumvention tools as essential to the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, providing a human-rights law basis for treating anti-censorship support as legitimate.",
        "source_4": "United Nations General Assembly — A/66/359 (Sept. 12, 2011), “International Code of Conduct for Information Security” (proposed by China, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan). This initiative emphasizes state sovereignty in the information space and calls on states to refrain from using ICTs to interfere in other states’ internal affairs—positioning foreign-backed circumvention efforts as illegitimate interference.",
        "source_5": "Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Cambridge University Press, 2017). The expert manual outlines that coercive interference in a state’s domaine réservé (e.g., public order, elections) may breach the non-intervention principle; while experts disagree whether facilitating censorship circumvention is “coercive,” the analysis highlights legal ambiguity and challenges to the claim of legitimacy.",
        "source_6": "Citizen Lab — “Collateral Freedom 2020: A Snapshot of Chinese Internet Censorship of International News Media” (Jeffrey Knockel, Lotus Ruan, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, 2020). Documents how anti-censorship tactics (e.g., domain fronting, collateral hosting) can trigger broad countermeasures and collateral blocking by censors, suggesting that making circumvention a foreign policy tool may escalate an arms race and risk unintended harm to users and third-party services."
