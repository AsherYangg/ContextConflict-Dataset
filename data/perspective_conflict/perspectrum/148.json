Heinrichs et al., 2020–2021) — Argues against extending New START without major changes, contending the treaty ignores Russia’s large stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, doesn’t constrain Russia’s novel systems, and leaves China’s growing arsenal outside any limits, thereby disadvantaging the United States. https://www.hudson.org/foreign-policy-defense",

        "source_6": "President of Russia, Address to the Federal Assembly (February 21, 2023) — Announces Russia’s suspension of participation in New START, halting inspections and data exchanges and casting doubt on the treaty’s functioning; framed as a response to U.S./NATO policies, this stance is cited by critics as evidence of arms control’s fragility with Moscow. http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70565"
