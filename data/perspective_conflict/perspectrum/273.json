        "source_2": "Rebecca Solnit, A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster (2009) — Documents how, after major disasters, ordinary people spontaneously self-organize effective mutual aid and order, often outperforming formal hierarchies, suggesting anarchist practices have practical, real-world value.",

        "source_4": "Mancur Olson, The Logic of Collective Action (1965) — Theoretical critique: in large groups, free-riding undermines the provision of public goods without coercive mechanisms, implying anarchism will struggle to sustain defense, infrastructure, and social insurance at scale.",

        "source_6": "Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974) — Philosophical argument that protective associations in an anarchy naturally coalesce into a dominant agency (a minimal state), suggesting stable anarchy is unlikely and that anarchism’s goals may be unattainable without some state authority."
