    "question": "Should the United States create a national high-speed rail system?",

        "source_1": "International Energy Agency (IEA) — “The Future of Rail” (2019). Key evidence: On city pairs of roughly 300–1,000 km, high‑speed rail can shift travelers from short‑haul flights and cars, delivering substantial CO2 reductions when powered by low‑carbon electricity. https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail",
        "source_2": "California High‑Speed Rail Authority — “2024 Draft Business Plan” (2024). Key evidence: The estimated cost for Phase 1 of California’s system is $106.2–$128.9 billion, with remaining funding gaps and schedule risks highlighted—illustrating the financial and delivery challenges a U.S. national HSR build‑out would face. https://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_Draft_Business_Plan.pdf",
        "source_3": "U.S. Department of Transportation (FRA) — “Biden‑Harris Administration Announces $8.2 Billion for 10 Major Passenger Rail Projects” (Dec. 8, 2023). Key evidence: Federal grants include $3.0B for Brightline West (Las Vegas–Southern California) and major support for California HSR, signaling strong federal backing and near‑term momentum in corridors judged viable for high‑speed service. https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-82-billion-10-major-passenger-rail-projects",
        "source_4": "Chester, M. and Horvath, A. — “Life-cycle assessment of high-speed rail: the case of California” (Environmental Research Letters, 2010). Key evidence: Life‑cycle emissions from construction are significant; net climate benefits depend on high ridership and a clean power mix, meaning HSR may take years to “pay back” its embodied carbon and may underperform if trains run under‑filled. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/1/014003",
        "source_5": "U.S. Government Accountability Office — “High Speed Passenger Rail: Future Development Will Depend on Addressing Financial and Other Challenges and Establishing a Clear Federal Role” (GAO‑10‑625, 2010). Key evidence: True high‑speed service generally requires dedicated, grade‑separated rights‑of‑way (not shared with freight), implying costly land acquisition and complex permitting—major practical barriers in the U.S. context. https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-10-625",
        "source_6": "Cato Institute — Randal O’Toole, “High‑Speed Rail: The Wrong Road for America” (Policy Analysis No. 625, 2008). Key evidence: Argues that America’s dispersed land use, long intercity distances, and evolving alternatives (autos, aviation) make HSR a poor value relative to other investments, warning of high subsidies and low utilization outside a few dense corridors. https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/high-speed-rail-wrong-road-america"
