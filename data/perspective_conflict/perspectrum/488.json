    "content": {
        "source_1": "U.S. Census Bureau — American Community Survey (Table S1601: Language Spoken at Home) — data.census.gov/table?q=S1601. Finding: A large majority of U.S. residents speak only English at home, and most who speak another language report speaking English “very well,” with a single-digit share classified as limited English proficient. Implication: English is already the de facto common language, suggesting an official-language law may have limited practical effect.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division — Language Minority Citizens (Voting Rights Act Section 203) — justice.gov/crt/language-minority-citizens. Finding: Federal law requires hundreds of covered jurisdictions to provide bilingual election materials for certain language minority groups (based on Census determinations). Implication: A federal English-only policy could conflict with existing voting-rights protections unless Congress amends the VRA.",
        "source_3": "Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43 (1997) — Oyez summary: oyez.org/cases/1996/95-974. Finding: While the Supreme Court vacated on mootness, the litigation highlighted that sweeping English-only mandates on government employees had been found unconstitutional by lower courts on First Amendment grounds. Implication: Broad official-English measures risk constitutional challenges that could limit or invalidate them.",
        "source_4": "Pew Research Center — What makes someone American? (Feb. 24, 2016) — pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/02/24/what-makes-someone-american. Finding: 90% of U.S. adults say being able to speak English is important to being “truly American.” Implication: Strong public sentiment that English proficiency is central to national identity bolsters arguments for designating English as the official language.",
        "source_5": "New American Economy (2017) — Not Lost in Translation: The Growing Importance of Foreign Language Skills in the U.S. Job Market — newamericaneconomy.org/press-release/not-lost-in-translation. Finding: Employer demand for bilingual workers more than doubled from 2010 to 2015, with notable needs in health care, customer service, and finance. Implication: Multilingual capacity is an economic asset; a strict official-English stance could undervalue skills the labor market increasingly demands.",
        "source_6": "National Conference of State Legislatures — Official English Statutes and Constitutional Amendments in the States — ncsl.org/research/immigration/official-english-statutes-and-constitutional-amendments-in-the-states.aspx. Finding: Over 30 states designate English as their official language, though scope and exceptions vary and many laws are largely symbolic. Implication: Proponents cite widespread state-level precedent to argue national adoption is feasible; critics note limited policy changes and frequent carve-outs."
