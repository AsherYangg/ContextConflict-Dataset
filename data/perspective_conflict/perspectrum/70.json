        "source_1": "UN OCHA, Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview 2024 (2024): OCHA estimates tens of millions need assistance and says access is “severely constrained” by administrative and security impediments, implying negotiated engagement with all parties, including de facto authorities, is often necessary to deliver life-saving aid at scale.",
        "source_2": "UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/55/67, March 2024): Documents ongoing atrocity crimes, widespread airstrikes, and systemic repression; urges governments to tighten coordinated sanctions (including on jet fuel and revenue sources) and warns against steps that could legitimize the junta—arguing against re-engagement that normalizes the regime.",
        "source_3": "Reuters, “Myanmar rebel alliance agrees China-brokered ceasefire with junta after talks in China” (Jan 12, 2024): Reports that Chinese mediation produced a localized ceasefire between the military and the Three Brotherhood Alliance along the border, suggesting that pragmatic external engagement can yield concrete de-escalation and humanitarian dividends.",
        "source_4": "World Bank, Myanmar Economic Monitor (June 2024): Finds economic activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels, with severe conflict- and policy-driven disruptions and worsening poverty; these data are used by proponents of calibrated re-engagement to argue that reopening channels for trade, aid, and technical cooperation could reduce collapse and spillover risks.",
        "source_5": "ASEAN, Chair’s Statement of the 43rd ASEAN Summit (Jakarta, Sept 2023): Expresses deep disappointment over the lack of progress on the Five-Point Consensus and maintains restrictions on the junta’s political participation—evidence that prior engagement efforts have not delivered meaningful change, bolstering arguments against “re-engagement” on the junta’s terms.",
        "source_6": "Human Rights Watch, “Bangladesh/Myanmar: Conditions Not in Place for Rohingya Returns” (2023–2024 updates): Concludes that Myanmar remains unsafe for Rohingya repatriation and cautions that diplomatic re-engagement aimed at returns risks coercion and legitimization of abusive authorities, advocating instead for pressure and protection-centered approaches."
