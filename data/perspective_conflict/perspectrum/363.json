        "source_1": "U.S. Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app. §§101–111) and OGE Form 278e public financial disclosure requirements — High-level federal officials must publicly disclose assets, income, liabilities, transactions, gifts, outside positions, and certain spousal/dependent information. This statutory regime deliberately curtails personal financial privacy to deter corruption and enable public scrutiny, supporting the view that politicians accept sharply reduced privacy in key domains.",
        "source_2": "County of San Jose v. Superior Court, 2 Cal.5th 608 (Cal. 2017) — The California Supreme Court held that emails and texts about public business are public records even when sent from officials’ private devices or accounts. This establishes that officials cannot shield work-related communications by invoking “private” channels, reinforcing a transparency-first approach that narrows their privacy.",
        "source_3": "Axel Springer AG v. Germany and Von Hannover v. Germany (No. 2), European Court of Human Rights (2012) — The ECtHR set criteria for balancing press freedom and privacy, holding that even public figures retain Article 8 privacy for purely private activities, while reporting that contributes to a debate of general interest may justifiably intrude. This directly rejects the absolute claim that politicians have “no” right to privacy, recognizing a qualified right.",
        "source_4": "Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) — The U.S. Supreme Court emphasized FOIA’s “central purpose” is to illuminate government operations, not to disclose personal details, and upheld robust privacy interests under FOIA’s privacy exemptions. Agencies routinely invoke these exemptions to withhold personal data of government employees and officials, evidencing a legal right to privacy against disclosure absent a strong public-interest nexus.",
        "source_5": "Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v. AEPD and Mario Costeja González, C‑131/12 (CJEU 2014); GDPR Article 85 and related case law — EU data protection law recognizes a “right to be forgotten”/delisting subject to public-interest and freedom-of-expression limits. Public figures face a higher bar to delisting, but their personal data are still protected where disclosure isn’t necessary for public debate. This shows politicians retain data-protection/privacy rights, albeit more constrained than private persons.",
        "source_6": "The Leveson Inquiry: An Inquiry into the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press (UK, 2012) — The official report documented intrusive press tactics against public figures, including politicians and their families, and recommended stronger protections. It argues that unchecked exposure causes harm and chills democratic participation, supporting the position that politicians do have a meaningful right to privacy that warrants enforcement."
