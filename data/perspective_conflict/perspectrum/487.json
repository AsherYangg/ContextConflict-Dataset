        "source_1": "U.S. Department of Defense press briefing (SecDef Ash Carter), Dec. 3, 2015 — Announced opening 220,000 previously closed combat positions to women with “no exceptions,” citing the need to draw on the full talent pool to maximize readiness while keeping standards job-related and unchanged. This policy decision reflects the view that equal opportunity enhances force effectiveness when standards are maintained.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Marine Corps Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force (GCEITF) assessment, 2015 — In controlled trials, all-male squads outperformed gender-integrated squads on a majority of evaluated tasks (reported as roughly 69%), and female Marines experienced significantly higher rates of musculoskeletal injuries and slower times on certain load-bearing events. This evidence raises concerns about average performance and injury risks in some frontline roles.",
        "source_3": "UK Ministry of Defence, Women in Ground Close Combat (WGCC) Review, 2016 — Concluded women should be eligible for ground close combat roles but identified higher musculoskeletal injury risks for women, especially under heavy loads, recommending gender-neutral, role-specific standards and targeted physical conditioning. The UK proceeded to open these roles (from 2018) with mitigation measures.",
        "source_4": "RAND Corporation, “Implications of Integrating Women into the Marine Corps Infantry,” 2015 — A synthesis of evidence and international experience (e.g., Canada, Australia) finding that unit cohesion and effectiveness are driven primarily by leadership, training, and clear, job-related standards; when these are applied consistently, integration need not degrade performance. Recommends deliberate implementation and injury-prevention programs.",
        "source_5": "Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), assessments of Female Engagement Teams (FETs) in Afghanistan, circa 2012–2013 — Found that female Marines and soldiers enabled access to local women, improved intelligence gathering and compliance at searches, and delivered mission effects unattainable by male-only patrols in culturally conservative areas. This suggests operational advantages to having women in forward-deployed, combat-adjacent/frontline roles.",
        "source_6": "Reporting on IDF Medical Corps findings (e.g., Jerusalem Post coverage, 2017) — Internal Israeli Defense Forces analyses of mixed-gender infantry units reportedly found high rates of stress fractures and other injuries among female soldiers (near half in some cohorts), substantially above male rates, raising questions about medical sustainability and readiness for certain load-bearing frontline assignments."
