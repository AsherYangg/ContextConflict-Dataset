    "question": "Should weapons inspectors leave Syria?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "OPCW statement on security incident in Douma (April 2018) — The OPCW reported that a UN security advance team came under fire and an explosive was detonated during preparations for inspectors to enter Douma after the alleged chemical attack, delaying the mission. Evidence used to argue that ongoing threats make Syria too dangerous for inspectors, supporting withdrawal on safety grounds.",
        "source_2": "Statements from the Russian Federation and the Syrian government at UN Security Council meetings — Russian and Syrian officials have repeatedly alleged that the OPCW has been politicized and used to pressure Damascus, arguing that continued inspector presence violates Syrian sovereignty and fuels geopolitical confrontation. Evidence used to argue inspectors should leave to reduce politicization and respect sovereignty.",
        "source_3": "OPCW–UN Joint Mission final reporting (2013–2014) on Syria’s declared stockpile — The joint mission verified the removal and destruction of Syria’s declared chemical weapons and key production equipment. Evidence used to argue the core disarmament task was completed years ago, so maintaining inspectors in-country yields diminishing returns and resources should be redeployed.",
        "source_4": "UN-OPCW investigative findings attributing chemical attacks (JIM 2016–2017; OPCW IIT 2020–2023) — Multiple reports concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for several chemical attacks after 2014. Evidence used to argue inspections remain essential for attribution, deterrence, and accountability; removing inspectors would embolden further violations.",
        "source_5": "UN disarmament briefings noting restricted access and noncooperation — UN briefings have documented persistent issues such as delayed visas, site restrictions, and incomplete disclosure by Syria. Some nonproliferation analysts contend that when access is systematically constrained, continued presence risks conferring false legitimacy without results; they argue inspections should be suspended or withdrawn until full, unconditional cooperation is granted."
