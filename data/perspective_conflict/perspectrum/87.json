    "question": "Should animals be kept in zoos?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Conservation breeding and reintroduction case studies (e.g., California condor, black‑footed ferret, Arabian oryx): Coordinated zoo programs have prevented extinctions and rebuilt wild populations via captive breeding, genetic management, and releases. These examples show zoos can function as conservation “arks” when paired with field partnerships, supporting the claim.",
        "source_2": "Visitor learning and attitude change studies at accredited zoos: Evaluations report measurable gains in conservation knowledge and stated pro‑environmental intentions after zoo visits and school programs, with large aggregate reach. This suggests zoos can educate and mobilize the public for wildlife protection, supporting the claim.",
        "source_3": "Animal welfare research on captivity‑related stress and stereotypies: Meta‑analyses and species reports document abnormal repetitive behaviors, elevated stress indicators, and health issues (e.g., pacing in wide‑ranging carnivores, foot/joint problems in elephants) that are linked to spatial and behavioral constraints. These findings indicate welfare compromises, opposing the claim.",
        "source_4": "Audits of zoos’ conservation impact and resource allocation: Analyses note that many animals displayed are not threatened, reintroduction successes are comparatively rare, and a small share of budgets goes to in‑situ conservation relative to exhibit and operations spending. This raises doubts about zoos’ overall conservation effectiveness, opposing the claim.",
        "source_5": "Zoos as scientific and emergency response infrastructure: Modern zoos contribute veterinary expertise, assisted reproduction, genetic biobanking, and disease surveillance (e.g., amphibian chytrid work), and run head‑starting/rescue programs for turtles, birds, and confiscated wildlife. This research and rescue capacity provides unique public‑good functions, supporting the claim.",
        "source_6": "Animal rights and ethics critiques: Rights‑based arguments hold that confining sentient, cognitively complex animals for public display violates autonomy and dignity, even under good husbandry; education could be achieved via sanctuaries, documentaries, or virtual reality without captivity. This moral reasoning opposes the claim."
