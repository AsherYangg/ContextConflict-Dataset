        "source_1": "Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) — “Breakfast for Learning” research summary: Reviews U.S. studies finding that school breakfast participation is associated with better attendance, reduced tardiness and nurse visits, improved dietary intake, and, in several studies, gains in math/reading performance—especially for low-income students. Supports universal or “after the bell” models to boost participation and reduce stigma.",
        "source_2": "USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) — Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) evaluations: Federal evaluations of CEP, which makes school meals free to all students in eligible schools, find sizable increases in breakfast participation, reductions in unpaid meal debt, and lower administrative burden from income-verification paperwork. Highlights stigma reduction when all students can eat without point-of-sale payment.",
        "source_3": "Government Accountability Office (GAO) — Reports on school meal program integrity: GAO has documented substantial improper payments and administrative errors in school meal programs. Critics of universal free meals point to these inefficiencies and argue that expanding benefits to all families (including higher-income households) is a less targeted use of limited public funds.",
        "source_4": "United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and NYC local reporting — “Breakfast in the Classroom” implementation concerns: Teacher groups and city audits/news coverage in New York City have raised operational issues with universal in-classroom breakfast (lost instructional time, sanitation/pest concerns, and custodial workload). Presents a logistical challenge perspective even when meals are free to all.",
        "source_5": "Adolphus, K. et al., systematic reviews on breakfast and academic outcomes (e.g., Frontiers in Human Neuroscience/Nutrients): Syntheses of high-income-country studies report mixed or context-dependent effects of breakfast on standardized test scores and cognition; benefits tend to be stronger for food-insecure or undernourished students, with smaller or null effects for well-nourished peers. Suggests universal provision may yield uneven academic returns.",
        "source_6": "California Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) — Analysis of the state Universal Meals initiative: State budget reviews note significant ongoing costs for providing free meals to all students and flag implementation pressures (food inflation, staffing, kitchen capacity). Opponents cite such fiscal impacts to argue for targeted eligibility rather than universal breakfast."
