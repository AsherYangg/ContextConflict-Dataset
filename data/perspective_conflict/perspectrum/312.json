        "source_1": "Government of Ghana — Tobacco Control Regulations, 2016 (L.I. 2247) under the Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851). Establishes a national prohibition on smoking in enclosed public places, workplaces, and public transport, sets signage and penalty requirements, and creates enforcement mechanisms—evidence that Ghana has a comprehensive legal framework other countries could replicate.",
        "source_2": "WHO Country Office for Ghana — News release on enforcement of smoke‑free public places (circa 2018–2019). Highlights multisectoral enforcement operations (health authorities, police, local government) to protect people from second‑hand smoke and presents Ghana’s implementation efforts as a positive example in the region.",
        "source_3": "Campaign for Tobacco‑Free Kids (Tobacco Control Laws) — Ghana country law profile, Smoke‑Free section (legal analysis, updated in the 2020s). Notes that Ghana’s law allows designated smoking rooms in certain venues, which is not fully aligned with WHO FCTC Article 8 guidelines for 100% smoke‑free environments—undercutting the claim that Ghana is a model.",
        "source_4": "Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) — Ghana Country Report (2017, CDC/WHO). Reports substantial self‑reported exposure to secondhand smoke in restaurants, bars, and workplaces years after the law’s adoption, indicating weak compliance/enforcement and challenging the “model for Africa” characterization."
