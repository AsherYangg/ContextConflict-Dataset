Kennedy, The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860–1914 (Allen & Unwin, 1980) — Kennedy argues that Germany’s naval buildup and Weltpolitik created a systemic threat that pushed Britain to seek countervailing understandings with France (1904) and Russia (1907); the Anglo-Russian Convention thus emerged as a near-inevitable balance-of-power response to German pressure.]",

Otte, The Foreign Office Mind: The Making of British Foreign Policy, 1865–1914 (Cambridge University Press, 2011) — Otte highlights the contingent, personality-driven nature of the 1907 deal, tracing how Edward Grey, Sir Arthur Nicolson, and A.

Friedberg, The Weary Titan: Britain and the Experience of Relative Decline, 1895–1905 (Princeton University Press, 1988) — Friedberg argues Britain’s fiscal strain and strategic overstretch drove a policy of diplomatic “economy of force”; the Anglo‑Russian settlement was a cost‑saving way to stabilize Britain’s vulnerable imperial frontiers, making rapprochement with Russia a near-inescapable choice from a budgetary standpoint.]",
