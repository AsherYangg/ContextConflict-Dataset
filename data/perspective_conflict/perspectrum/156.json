    "question": "Should the European Union lift its ban on member states selling arms to China?",

        "source_1": "European Council/EEAS background on the China arms embargo and EU export-control law: The 1989 EU arms embargo on China is a political declaration adopted after Tiananmen, not a harmonized, legally codified list; since 2008, the legally binding EU Common Position on arms exports requires case-by-case licensing against criteria including human rights and regional stability. This means lifting the embargo would not automatically greenlight sales—licenses would still be refused where criteria are not met, but removing the political embargo could align policy with the existing legal framework.",
        "source_2": "Human rights NGOs’ assessments (Amnesty International/Human Rights Watch 2024–2025 country reports): Continued findings of systematic abuses in Xinjiang, repression in Tibet, erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong, and widespread surveillance and arbitrary detention. These assessments directly engage EU export criteria on human rights and risks of internal repression, supporting the position that lifting the embargo would conflict with EU values and legal standards for arms transfers.",
        "source_3": "U.S. export-control and alliance implications (ITAR §126.1 and U.S. defense procurement rules): The United States treats China as an arms-embargoed destination; re-exports of U.S.-origin components require U.S. authorization and are typically denied. EU firms selling to China risk license denials, losing access to U.S. technology and the U.S. defense market, and straining NATO cohesion—an argument against lifting the EU embargo due to transatlantic and compliance costs.",
        "source_4": "SIPRI arms-transfer trend data on China: China’s arms imports have declined markedly over the past decade as domestic production capacity expanded; European suppliers have a negligible share of China’s defense imports. This suggests the economic upside of lifting the embargo would be limited, while political and strategic costs could be high—undercutting pro-lifting arguments based on market opportunity.",
        "source_5": "European policy/industry argument for “principled engagement” (EUISS and European industry analysts): Past EU policy analyses and industry voices have argued the embargo is outdated and inconsistent, and that replacing it with a transparent, unified EU licensing approach under the Common Position could improve coherence, maintain strict end-use controls, and offer leverage in broader EU–China relations. Proponents claim carefully circumscribed sales (e.g., non-lethal systems) could support EU industrial competitiveness without compromising norms.",
        "source_6": "Indo-Pacific security assessments (IISS/RAND analyses of PLA modernization): Studies highlight how even non-kinetic European technologies—advanced sensors, power electronics, marine propulsion, and ASW-enabling subsystems—could materially enhance PLA capabilities affecting the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea balance. This supports retaining the embargo to avoid unintended military effects and regional destabilization."
