        "source_1": "UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression (Frank La Rue), Report A/HRC/17/27 (2011), United Nations Human Rights Council — Argues that the same rights people have offline must also be protected online, and calls on states to facilitate, not criminalize, access to tools that enable anonymity and circumvention of censorship. This provides a human-rights basis for using aid to support such technologies.",
        "source_2": "Freedom on the Net 2023, Freedom House — Documents a global rise in internet censorship, shutdowns, and targeted surveillance of journalists and bloggers. Notes that circumvention and privacy tools are often critical for maintaining access to independent news and communication during crackdowns, supporting the case for foreign aid to expand availability and resilience of these tools.",
        "source_3": "Open Technology Fund (OTF) Annual/Impact Report (recent years) — Reports that aid-funded, open-source projects (e.g., Tor ecosystem components, Psiphon, censorship-resistant transport protocols) have reached large at-risk user populations and improved the security of the broader internet. Emphasizes cost-effectiveness, open audits, and public-good spillovers as reasons foreign aid delivers outsized impact when invested in this space.",
        "source_4": "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), analysis of the 2010 “Haystack” case — Details how a highly publicized anti-censorship tool, backed by Western funding and hype, was found to be insecure and potentially put Iranian users at grave risk. Warns that poorly vetted or rushed aid-funded tools can create a false sense of safety and cause harm, arguing for extreme caution and rigorous security audits before deploying.",
        "source_5": "Human Rights Watch, reporting on “foreign agents” laws and crackdowns (e.g., Russia) — Shows how governments label foreign-funded initiatives as hostile interference, criminalize use of certain privacy/circumvention tools, and target journalists and NGOs associated with them. Suggests that channeling foreign aid into such software can trigger legal and political backlash that endangers intended beneficiaries.",
        "source_6": "Access Now, commentary on the 2018 end of “domain fronting” by major cloud providers — Explains how a widely used censorship-circumvention technique was abruptly rendered unusable by platform policy changes at large U.S. tech companies, illustrating the fragility of some approaches. Raises concerns about the sustainability and long-term effectiveness of investing aid in techniques that can be neutralized by infrastructure or policy shifts."
