Finds strong macroeconomic returns: each $1 invested in U.S. public transportation generates roughly $5 in economic returns, and every $1 billion invested supports about 50,000 jobs, through construction, operations, and induced productivity gains. https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/research-reports/economic-impact-of-public-transportation-investment-2020-update/",

Concludes with high confidence that investments which shift trips to public transport (alongside walking/cycling and compact urban form) are impactful mitigation options with significant co-benefits (air quality, health, equity). Demand-side measures including modal shift can deliver large emissions reductions by 2050. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/",

Cautions that, as of 2022, nationwide transit ridership and fare revenues remained well below 2019 levels (ridership roughly ~60% of prepandemic), creating operating budget gaps as federal relief wanes; warns that uncertain demand challenges the case for costly expansions versus maintaining state of good repair. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58478",

Documents systemic risks: average cost overruns of about 45% for rail projects (and ~20% for roads), and large demand shortfalls for rail (passenger forecasts overestimated by about 100% on average), implying many transit megaprojects deliver poorer-than-promised value without strong governance reforms. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4096594 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944360508976688",

Shows that well-designed Bus Rapid Transit can deliver high-capacity, metro-like service at a fraction of rail costs (often $5–15 million per km for BRT versus $100–350 million per km for metro), e.g., Bogotá’s TransMilenio moving >40,000 passengers/hour/direction, suggesting targeted bus-based investments may yield higher value-for-money. https://brtstandard.org/ and https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-brt-standard/",

Finds that electrification of vehicles (especially light-duty) and clean power drive the bulk of transportation-sector GHG reductions; while public transit has important co-benefits, broad emissions goals are achieved primarily through EV adoption and pricing/reform, implying transit investment should be targeted where it is most effective. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25932 and https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26301"
