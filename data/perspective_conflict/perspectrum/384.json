        "source_1": "Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion (2006) — Argues that naturalistic explanations suffice for phenomena once attributed to gods, that the God hypothesis lacks empirical support, and that parsimony (Occam’s razor) favors atheism; supports the claim that atheism is the most rational “way.”",
        "source_2": "Alvin Plantinga, Warranted Christian Belief (2000) — Develops reformed epistemology, contending that belief in God can be “properly basic” and rational without inferential evidence; challenges the notion that atheism is the only intellectually defensible stance.",
        "source_3": "Pew Research Center, cross-national surveys on religion and society (e.g., The Global God Divide, 2020) — Finds that highly secular countries (e.g., in Northern Europe) exhibit high life satisfaction, social trust, and human development, indicating that flourishing societies can be built without widespread religiosity; indirectly supports the viability of atheism/secularism.",
        "source_4": "Li, Stampfer, Williams, and VanderWeele, JAMA Internal Medicine (2016) — Large cohort study reporting that regular attendance at religious services is associated with lower mortality and reduced risks of depression and substance use; suggests communal religious practice can confer tangible benefits, challenging the idea that atheism is the only beneficial path.",
        "source_5": "John Hick, An Interpretation of Religion (1989) — Articulates religious pluralism: diverse traditions facilitate transformative moral-spiritual growth, implying multiple valid “ways” rather than a single exclusive one; counters the claim’s exclusivity.",
        "source_6": "Stephen Jay Gould, Nonoverlapping Magisteria (Natural History, 1997) — Proposes that science and religion address distinct domains of inquiry and value, allowing for religious commitments without conflict with scientific reasoning; disputes that atheism is required as the sole coherent worldview."
