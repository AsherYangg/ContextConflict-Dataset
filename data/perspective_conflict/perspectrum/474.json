        "source_1": "Nina Tannenwald, The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons (Princeton University Press, 2007). Argues that a powerful stigma against nuclear use constrains state behavior; unilateral disarmament by influential states could strengthen this taboo and further delegitimize nuclear weapons, promoting global safety through normative change.",
        "source_2": "Eric Schlosser, Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety (Penguin, 2013). Documents multiple near-misses and systemic safety failures in nuclear arsenals; reducing or eliminating a state’s arsenal—even unilaterally—lowers the probability of accidental detonation or unauthorized use, improving global safety independent of others’ actions.",
        "source_3": "John J. Mearsheimer, “The Case for a Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent,” Foreign Affairs, 72(3), 1993. Contends that relinquishing nuclear weapons can expose states to aggression; subsequent events in Ukraine are often cited as validation that unilateral disarmament may undermine security and embolden adversaries, thereby risking wider instability.",
        "source_4": "Thomas C. Schelling, Arms and Influence (Yale University Press, 1966). Presents the logic of nuclear deterrence: nuclear forces deter coercion and large-scale war by credibly threatening costs; unilateral disarmament weakens bargaining power and deterrence, potentially inviting blackmail or conflict and reducing overall safety.",
        "source_5": "Waldo Stumpf, “The Birth and Death of the South African Nuclear Weapons Programme,” presentation, 1995 (widely reproduced in policy archives). Details South Africa’s unilateral dismantlement, which facilitated international reintegration, transparency, and regional confidence-building—evidence that in some contexts unilateral disarmament can enhance security and stability.",
        "source_6": "Robert Jervis, “Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma,” World Politics, 30(2), 1978. Shows how unilateral, costly signals of restraint can shift expectations and reduce arms racing; applied to nuclear weapons, such actions can build trust and initiate reciprocal measures, suggesting unilateral steps may catalyze broader safety-enhancing dynamics."
