    "content": {
        "source_1": "UK Electoral Commission — News release: “Vote Leave fined and referred to the police after Electoral Commission finds it broke electoral law” (17 July 2018). Evidence: The official regulator found the designated Leave campaign breached spending rules and coordinated unlawfully with another group, raising concerns about the integrity of the 2016 vote and providing a basis some cite for a confirmatory second referendum before exit.",
        "source_2": "Bank of England — “EU withdrawal scenarios and monetary and financial stability” (28 November 2018). Evidence: The BoE’s scenario analysis concluded that, relative to continued EU membership, most Brexit outcomes were expected to leave UK GDP lower in the medium to long term; proponents argue voters should have a chance to revisit the decision in light of concrete economic assessments unavailable in 2016.",
        "source_3": "NatCen Social Research / John Curtice — What UK Thinks: EU analysis “Has there been a shift in public opinion on Brexit?” (January 2019). Evidence: Aggregated polling indicated a consistent, if modest, lead for Remain in hypothetical repeat ballots from 2018 onward; supporters of a second vote frame this as democratic updating as new information and negotiations emerged.",
        "source_4": "UK Prime Minister Theresa May — Oral statement to Parliament on Brexit next steps (21 January 2019). Evidence: May argued a second referendum would set a damaging precedent and undermine trust in democracy by suggesting the initial result would be accepted only if it delivered a particular outcome, thus opposing a rerun on constitutional and legitimacy grounds.",
        "source_5": "House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee — Report “The land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland” (First Report, Session 2017–19; March 2018). Evidence: The committee warned that avoiding physical infrastructure on the Irish land border post-Brexit would be extremely difficult without close regulatory alignment, highlighting risks to the Good Friday Agreement; some argue these complexities justify a public confirmatory vote.",
        "source_6": "The UK in a Changing Europe — “Brexit and public opinion 2019” (2019). Evidence: The report documents deepening polarization, with strong Leave/Remain identities often eclipsing party allegiance; critics contend a second referendum could intensify societal divisions and fail to deliver closure, arguing against holding another vote."
