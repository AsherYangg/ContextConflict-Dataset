        "source_1": "Johnston, Patrick B., and Anoop K. Sarbahi. “The Impact of U.S. Drone Strikes on Terrorism in Pakistan.” International Studies Quarterly (2016). Peer-reviewed analysis using panel data finds U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan were associated with short-term reductions in militant attacks and IED incidents, suggesting effectiveness at degrading insurgent capacity. Supports the claim by providing evidence drones can reduce subsequent violence by removing combatants and facilitators.",
        "source_2": "Congressional Research Service (Jeremiah Gertler). “U.S. Unmanned Aerial Systems.” CRS Report (various updates; initial 2012). Details how armed UAVs provide persistent surveillance, strike precision, and eliminate risk to pilots while generally costing less per flight hour than many manned aircraft. Supports the claim from an operational and cost/force-protection perspective for taking out enemy combatants.",
        "source_3": "Stanford Law School & NYU School of Law. “Living Under Drones: Death, Injury, and Trauma to Civilians From U.S. Drone Practices in Pakistan.” (2012). Field interviews and case studies document civilian fear, psychological trauma, disruption of daily life, and allegations of “double-tap” strikes discouraging rescue efforts, arguing official civilian casualty counts understate harm. Challenges the claim by highlighting humanitarian and societal costs.",
        "source_4": "United Nations Human Rights Council. Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns: “Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions” (A/HRC/23/47, 2013). Raises legal concerns about cross-border drone strikes, including state sovereignty, the applicability of international humanitarian law vs. human rights law outside active battlefields, and transparency/accountability deficits. Challenges the claim on legality and norms.",
        "source_5": "Cronin, Audrey Kurth. “Why Drones Fail: When Tactics Drive Strategy.” Foreign Affairs (2013). Argues targeted killings can produce short-term tactical gains but often fail strategically by encouraging terrorist group adaptation, decentralization, and recruitment, and by alienating local populations. Challenges the claim on long-term strategic effectiveness grounds.",
        "source_6": "The Intercept. “The Drone Papers.” Investigative series (2015). Leaked U.S. military documents reported high rates of unintended casualties during specific operations (e.g., Afghanistan’s Operation Haymaker) and reliance on metadata/signature strikes, raising concerns about target accuracy and oversight. Challenges the claim by questioning precision and accountability in practice."
