        "source_1": "Anderson, C. A., Carnagey, N. L., & Eubanks, J. (2003). Exposure to songs with violent lyrics increases aggressive thoughts and feelings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84(5), 960–971. Evidence: Controlled experiments found that listening to songs with violent lyrics increased listeners’ aggressive cognitions and affect, suggesting violent lyrical content can have measurable short-term effects on attitudes and interpretations relevant to aggression.",
        "source_2": "Supreme Court of Canada — R v Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452. Evidence: The Court upheld restrictions on sexually explicit material that is violent or degrading, emphasizing a harm-based approach tied to the equality and dignity of women. This ruling provides a legal precedent in a democratic jurisdiction for limiting expression that contributes to violence against women, supporting the argument for bans in some contexts.",
        "source_3": "U.S. Supreme Court — Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011). Evidence: The Court struck down a California law restricting violent video games to minors, holding that violent content is protected speech and the state failed to show a causal link to harm strong enough to survive strict scrutiny. By analogy, broad bans on music that “glorifies” violence are likely unconstitutional in the U.S., arguing against bans.",
        "source_4": "BBC News (2018). YouTube deletes ‘violent’ UK drill music videos after Met Police request. Evidence: YouTube removed dozens of drill videos at police request amid concerns they incited violence; civil liberties groups warned this disproportionately targeted Black artists and lacked clear evidence of impact on crime. The episode illustrates enforcement risks: subjective standards, discriminatory impact, and uncertain effectiveness of takedowns/bans.",
        "source_5": "The Verge (2018). Spotify walks back hateful conduct policy after criticism. Evidence: Spotify’s attempt to de-promote artists over “hate content/hateful conduct” (including violent or misogynistic themes) was reversed after backlash over vague definitions and inconsistent application. This case shows practical challenges in defining and enforcing bans on “glorifying” content without arbitrariness.",
        "source_6": "World Health Organization & UN Women (2019). RESPECT Women: Preventing violence against women. Evidence: Identifies harmful social norms and media portrayals as risk factors but recommends multi-component prevention (education, community norm change, engaging media for positive portrayals) rather than outright bans. Suggests non-ban strategies may reduce harm more effectively and with fewer free-speech costs."
