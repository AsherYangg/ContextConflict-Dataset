Describes Israel’s legislated priority system that gives transplant priority points to registered donors and families who consent to donation; early implementation was associated with increases in donor registration and consent, supporting reciprocity as a way to boost supply.",

Official policy specifies that individuals who opt out of organ donation receive lower priority for organ transplants, operationalizing a deny/deprioritize-non-donors approach as a fairness measure against free-riding.",

U.S. allocation must be based on sound medical judgment, urgency, and expected outcomes; using donor registration status to deny or downgrade access would conflict with established allocation principles and governance.",

Warns that punitive or reciprocity-based priority schemes can unfairly disadvantage people medically ineligible to donate or with conscientious/religious objections, risk eroding altruism and public trust, and should not be used to deny care.",

Experimental and field evidence shows donor-priority rules can increase registration, but effects depend on design and may not translate into higher actual donation if other barriers (e.g., family veto, system capacity) persist."
