Meta-analysis found a positive relationship between homework and achievement in middle and high school, but little to none in elementary grades; suggests benefits are contingent on age and reasonable amounts (e.g., the “10-minute rule”).",
        "source_2": "Galloway, M., Conner, J., & Pope, D. (2013). Nonacademic Effects of Homework in Privileged, High-Performing High Schools (The Journal of Experimental Education). Survey and qualitative data showed heavy homework loads were linked to high stress, physical health problems, and reduced time for family and extracurriculars, indicating potential harms that can outweigh academic benefits.",
        "source_3": "OECD (2014). PISA in Focus: Does Homework Perpetuate Inequalities? Analysis of international data reported weak links between time spent on homework and performance after controlling for background, diminishing returns at higher homework loads, and larger socioeconomic achievement gaps in systems with heavier homework expectations.",
        "source_4": "Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) Teaching & Learning Toolkit: Homework (Primary and Secondary). Evidence summaries indicate homework can have a positive impact when tasks are purposeful and receive feedback, with stronger effects reported in secondary settings; emphasizes that quality of design and feedback, not mere quantity, drives benefits.",
        "source_5": "Maltese, A. V., Tai, R. H., & Fan, X. (2012). When Is Homework Worth the Time? (The High School Journal). Using national datasets, the study found time on homework showed little relation to standardized test scores in math and science but was positively associated with course grades, suggesting homework may influence grading practices and compliance more than deep learning.",
        "source_6": "Kohn, A. (2006). The Homework Myth (book). Synthesizing critiques of existing research, argues there is no compelling evidence that homework improves academic achievement in younger students and that it can undermine motivation and family relationships, challenging the premise that homework is broadly beneficial."
