        "source_1": "IUCN Red List and TRAFFIC — Status of African Elephants and Rhino Poaching Trends (2021–2023). IUCN’s 2021 reassessment lists African forest elephants as Critically Endangered and savanna elephants as Endangered after decades of decline; TRAFFIC reports persistent, organized poaching pressure on rhinos and elephants despite some recent dips. Evidence supports the view that many species remain under acute threat and require stronger legal protection and enforcement.",
        "source_2": "World Bank/WTTC and Rwanda Development Board — Nature-based tourism returns from strong protection (2018–2020). Analyses show tourism is a major GDP and jobs driver in several African economies; Rwanda’s strict protection of mountain gorillas, high permit fees, and revenue-sharing with communities coincided with gorilla population growth and substantial local income. Evidence suggests tougher protections can yield long-term economic gains that fund conservation and livelihoods.",
        "source_3": "Oakland Institute and UN Special Rapporteurs — Human rights costs of “fortress conservation” (2022). Reports document evictions and abuses linked to conservation areas (e.g., Maasai in Ngorongoro/Loliondo, Batwa in protected forests), with UN experts urging rights-respecting approaches. Evidence cautions that simply “toughening” protections can violate Indigenous and local community rights and backfire for conservation.",
        "source_4": "Naidoo et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences — Namibia’s communal conservancies (2016). Peer-reviewed research finds community-based management and regulated sustainable use (including tourism and trophy hunting) increased wildlife populations and delivered household benefits across Namibia’s conservancies. Evidence indicates devolved, incentive-based governance can outperform blanket crackdowns.",
        "source_5": "IPBES Sustainable Use Assessment and FAO/CIFOR — Reliance on wild species and bushmeat (2011–2022). Global and regional assessments find hundreds of millions rely on wild species for food and income; in parts of the Congo Basin, wild meat is a key protein source. Evidence warns that harsher criminalization without viable alternatives can harm food security and livelihoods, undermining compliance and conservation goals.",
        "source_6": "ENACT Africa and Transparency International — Corruption and capacity gaps in wildlife enforcement (2019–2021). Studies show that even with strict laws and CITES listings, trafficking persists due to corruption, weak oversight, and limited resources in enforcement and judiciary systems. Evidence suggests the priority should be governance and anti-corruption reforms rather than merely tightening statutes."
