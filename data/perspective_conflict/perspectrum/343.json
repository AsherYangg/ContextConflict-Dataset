Comparative LCOE analysis finds new-build nuclear is among the most expensive power sources (indicative unsubsidized range ~$141–$221/MWh) while utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind are among the lowest-cost options (roughly ~$24–$96/MWh and ~$24–$75/MWh, respectively), supporting the case that renewables deliver cheaper new generation than nuclear. https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/",

Reports record-breaking renewables additions in 2023 (well over 500 GW, dominated by solar PV) and continued rapid growth through 2024–2025, highlighting the speed and scale at which wind and solar can be deployed relative to the long lead times typical for new nuclear projects. https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2024",

Using experience curves, the study finds strong, persistent cost-learning for solar, wind, and batteries (costs fall as deployment scales), whereas nuclear shows weak or negative learning in many regions; this implies future system costs are likely lower in pathways that emphasize rapidly scaling renewables and storage. https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00368-1",

Argues that firm, low-carbon power from nuclear can lower overall decarbonization system costs by reducing reliance on long-duration storage, overbuilding, and expanded transmission at very high variable-renewable shares; cautions that nuclear’s role depends on achieving substantial cost and schedule improvements. https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-energy-carbon-constrained-world/",

Finds nuclear power has very low lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions comparable to wind and lower than solar PV, along with relatively small land and material footprints per unit of electricity, countering arguments that nuclear is environmentally inferior to renewables. https://unece.org/sed/documents/2021/10/reports/life-cycle-assessment-electricity-generation-options",
        "source_6": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — Queued Up: Characteristics of Power Plants Seeking Transmission Interconnection in the United States (2023). Shows the vast majority of projects in interconnection queues are wind, solar, and storage, with median wait times reaching ~5 years and a low completion rate; this indicates major grid and permitting bottlenecks that can slow renewable buildout unless transmission and process reforms are co-invested alongside generation. https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/queued-characteristics-power-plants-5"
