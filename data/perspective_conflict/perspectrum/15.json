        "source_1": "[Congressional Budget Office (2010), “Economic Effects of Reducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Occur in 2011.” CBO concluded that extending the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income households provides relatively weak short-run economic stimulus per dollar of budgetary cost, because higher-income households are more likely to save rather than spend additional after-tax income. Letting the high-income cuts expire would raise substantial revenue and reduce deficits with comparatively modest near-term drag relative to extending them.]",
        "source_2": "[Tax Foundation (various analyses, e.g., 2012–2016 using the Taxes and Growth model). Modeling finds that allowing the Bush-era cuts on top earners to lapse—raising top marginal rates and taxes on dividends/capital gains—would reduce long-run GDP, capital formation, and wages, and would adversely affect many pass-through businesses whose profits face top individual rates. This perspective emphasizes negative growth and investment effects from higher top rates.]",

Hungerford (2012), “Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of the Top Tax Rates Since 1945.” CRS found little to no statistically significant relationship between changes in top marginal tax rates and economic growth, savings, or investment over the postwar period, suggesting that increasing top rates (e.g., by removing Bush-era cuts for the wealthy) is unlikely to materially harm macroeconomic performance.]",

TPC’s distribution tables show that the Bush tax cuts delivered disproportionately large benefits to high-income households; reversing the high-end provisions would concentrate the resulting tax increase at the top and increase overall progressivity, reducing after-tax inequality.]",
        "source_5": "[Joint Committee on Taxation and Tax Policy Center (2011–2012 briefs on pass-through income). JCT and TPC report that while only a small share of tax filers with business income are in the top brackets, a large share of total pass-through business income accrues to those high-income filers—implying that allowing top-rate cuts to expire would hit a significant portion of business income. Advocates cite this to warn of potential effects on investment and hiring in pass-through firms; opponents note the small share of affected “small business” owners.]",
        "source_6": "[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (2014), analyses of the 2013 American Taxpayer Relief Act (which allowed Bush-era rates to rise for top earners). CBPP highlighted that after the top rate increased in 2013, the economy continued to add jobs at a solid pace and GDP growth did not noticeably falter, arguing that recent experience undermines claims that higher top rates meaningfully impede overall job creation or growth.]"
