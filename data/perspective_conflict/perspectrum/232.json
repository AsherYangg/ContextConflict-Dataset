        "source_1": "Lazard (2024). Levelized Cost of Energy analysis. https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energy - Evidence: Unsubsidized onshore wind shows among the lowest LCOE of new-build generation (roughly tens of dollars per MWh), often undercutting new gas and far below coal, supporting wind as a cost-effective cornerstone for future supply.",
        "source_2": "International Energy Agency (2023). Net Zero Roadmap: 2023 Update. https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-1-5-c-goal-in-reach-2023-update - Evidence: In pathways consistent with 1.5°C, global renewables capacity must triple by 2030, with wind expansion a central pillar; wind becomes a major share of generation in many regions, indicating it should be a primary focus to meet climate goals.",
        "source_3": "Sepulveda, Jenkins, de Sisternes, Lester (2018). The Role of Firm Low-Carbon Resources in Deep Decarbonization of Power Generation. Joule. https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30386-6 - Evidence: System modeling shows portfolios that rely almost exclusively on variable renewables (wind/solar) plus short-duration storage face steep costs to maintain reliability at high decarbonization; adding firm low-carbon resources materially lowers system cost, arguing against making wind the singular primary focus.",
        "source_4": "Loss, Will, Loss (2013). Estimates of bird collision mortality at wind facilities in the contiguous United States. PLOS ONE. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067927 - Evidence: Meta-analysis estimates roughly 140,000–328,000 bird deaths annually from wind turbine collisions in the U.S., highlighting nontrivial wildlife impacts and the need for mitigation if wind is to be scaled as a primary energy source.",
        "source_5": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2024). Queued Up: Characteristics of Power Plants Seeking Transmission Interconnection in the U.S. https://emp.lbl.gov/queues - Evidence: Interconnection queues have swelled to several terawatts (dominated by wind, solar, and storage), with median wait times exceeding five years and high withdrawal rates, indicating grid and permitting bottlenecks that complicate making wind a primary near-term supply focus.",
        "source_6": "International Energy Agency (2024). Offshore Wind Market Update 2024. https://www.iea.org/reports/offshore-wind-market-update-2024 - Evidence: Offshore wind faced sharp cost inflation and higher financing costs in 2023–2024, triggering auction shortfalls and contract cancellations in multiple markets, underscoring volatility and policy/finance risks if wind (especially offshore) is treated as a primary pillar without diversification."
