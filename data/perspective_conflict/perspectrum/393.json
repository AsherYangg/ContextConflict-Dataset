    "question": "Should the Gulf States take in more Syrian refugees?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "UNHCR – Syria Regional Refugee Response (Operational Data Portal, accessed 2024): Reports over 5 million registered Syrian refugees primarily in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt, with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states not listed as host countries. Evidence that the Gulf hosts very few officially recognized Syrian refugees.",
        "source_2": "Amnesty International (2015–2016 statements/reports on Syria’s refugee crisis): Concludes Gulf countries offered zero formal resettlement places to Syrian refugees and urges wealthier states, including the GCC, to share responsibility by admitting more refugees.",
        "source_3": "UN OCHA Financial Tracking Service and donor conference records (2013–2016): Show Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE among the largest donors to the Syria response; Kuwait hosted major pledging conferences raising billions, and the UAE funded the Mrajeeb Al Fhood camp in Jordan. Gulf governments cite this substantial aid and issuance of work/residency permits to Syrians as alternative burden-sharing to resettlement.",
        "source_4": "UNHCR – States Parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol (treaty status list): None of the GCC states are parties, and most lack domestic asylum systems. This legal context is used to argue that large-scale refugee admissions would require significant legal and institutional reforms.",
        "source_5": "Human Rights Watch (multiple reports on the Gulf’s kafala/sponsorship systems, various years): Documents pervasive labor abuses and limited protections for non-citizens in GCC countries. Rights groups caution that bringing Syrians under current systems risks exploitation and would not guarantee core refugee protections unless reforms precede or accompany admissions.",
        "source_6": "World Bank and ILO evaluations of the Jordan Compact (2016–2021): Find that structured schemes granting Syrians legal work access, paired with investment, improved self-reliance and created jobs. Cited by proponents as evidence that carefully designed labor-market access could make hosting Syrians economically viable in Gulf states too."
