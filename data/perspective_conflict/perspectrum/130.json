        "source_1": "NHLPA Player Poll (2018–19): In a league-wide survey of players, 98% responded that fighting has a place in today’s NHL, indicating strong on-ice stakeholder support for allowing it and its perceived role in game dynamics and accountability.",
        "source_2": "Boston University CTE Center case findings: Autopsies of former NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard and Bob Probert, identified chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), highlighting elevated long-term brain health risks associated with repeated head impacts and fighting.",
        "source_3": "IIHF/NCAA rule frameworks: International (IIHF) and U.S. college (NCAA) hockey impose automatic ejections and severe penalties for fighting, yet those leagues remain competitive and skill-focused; Canada’s QMJHL also adopted a near-ban in 2023, suggesting the sport can function without fighting.",
        "source_4": "NHL trend and business data: Fighting majors per game have fallen to historic lows over the past decade while league revenues, attendance, and media deals have grown, undermining the claim that fighting is necessary for fan interest or financial performance.",
        "source_5": "NHL coaches/GMs’ deterrence rationale: Team executives and coaches have repeatedly argued fighting serves as a self-policing mechanism—deterring cheap shots, protecting star players, and diffusing escalating scrums when officiating cannot catch everything.",
        "source_6": "Empirical analyses of deterrence: Academic and analytics studies using NHL penalty and injury data have found little to no statistical evidence that the presence of enforcers or fighting frequency reduces dangerous infractions or injuries, challenging the self-policing justification."
