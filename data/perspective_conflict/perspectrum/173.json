        "source_1": "Mattick RP; Wadolowski M; Aiken A; et al. (2018). The Lancet Public Health — Australian Parental Supply of Alcohol Longitudinal Study (APSALS). Prospective data found that parental supply of alcohol did not protect adolescents from harmful drinking; instead, it was associated with higher odds of binge drinking and alcohol-related harms, and adolescents continued to obtain alcohol from non-parental sources. Perspective: challenges the claim.",
        "source_2": "American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Committee on Substance Use and Prevention (policy statements and clinical reports, e.g., 2015–2021). AAP advises that no amount of alcohol is safe for children and adolescents, citing neurodevelopmental vulnerability, injury risk, and association between early initiation and later alcohol use disorder; it explicitly discourages parents from providing alcohol to minors. Perspective: challenges the claim.",
        "source_3": "ESPAD Report 2019 (European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs; published 2020 by ESPAD/EMCDDA). Cross-national survey data show lower rates of adolescent heavy episodic drinking in several Southern/Mediterranean countries (where family meals and supervised sipping are more culturally common) compared with some Northern European countries. While correlational and confounded by broader cultural norms, proponents use this pattern to argue that normalized, family-context drinking can socialize more moderate habits. Perspective: cautiously supports the claim (cultural correlation).",
        "source_4": "Gilligan C; Kypri K; et al. (2012). Drug and Alcohol Review — qualitative interviews with parents about supplying alcohol. Many parents report providing small amounts under supervision to “teach responsible drinking,” reduce the “forbidden fruit” effect, and encourage open communication; they perceive supervised introduction as a harm-minimization strategy. Perspective: supports the claim (parental/harm-reduction rationale), though not outcome evidence.",
        "source_5": "NIAAA Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) — “Furnishing Alcohol to Minors” (ongoing legal database). Summarizes U.S. state laws showing that in many jurisdictions it is illegal to provide alcohol to minors, with limited or no parental exceptions; civil and criminal liabilities (social host laws) can apply even in homes. Perspective: challenges the claim on legal/ethical grounds, regardless of intentions.",
        "source_6": "National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) — reviews on the adolescent brain and alcohol (e.g., “The Teen Brain and Alcohol,” imaging studies synthesized through 2020–2022). Evidence from human neuroimaging and animal studies links early alcohol exposure to alterations in prefrontal and hippocampal development, impaired memory/executive function, and increased risk of later alcohol use disorder; earlier onset is a consistent risk factor. Perspective: challenges the claim based on neurodevelopmental risks."
