    "question": "Should bottled water be banned?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Pacific Institute — “Bottled Water and Energy: A Fact Sheet” (Gleick & Cooley, 2007). Key finding: Producing the plastic bottles for U.S. bottled water in 2006 used roughly 17 million barrels of oil equivalent; transportation and chilling add further emissions, indicating a far higher environmental footprint than tap water. Perspective: Supports bans on environmental grounds.",
        "source_2": "Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) — “Bottled Water: Pure Drink or Pure Hype?” (1999). Key finding: A multi-year test of over 100 bottled water brands found some samples contained contaminants and concluded bottled water isn’t necessarily safer than tap; highlights weaker FDA oversight versus EPA rules for tap water. Perspective: Undercuts safety claims for bottled water and bolsters arguments for restrictions.",
        "source_3": "World Health Organization — “Microplastics in Drinking Water” (2019). Key finding: Based on available evidence, microplastics in drinking water are not shown to pose a health risk at current levels; priorities should be improving water and wastewater treatment rather than targeting bottled water. Perspective: Argues against health-based justifications for bans.",
        "source_4": "American Journal of Public Health — Evaluation of the University of Vermont’s campus bottled water sales ban (2015). Key finding: After the ban, sugary drink sales increased and total plastic beverage bottles sold did not decline, indicating unintended consequences that can undermine health and environmental goals. Perspective: Cautions that bans may backfire.",
        "source_5": "U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Ready.gov — “Water (Emergency Supplies)” guidance (ongoing). Key finding: FEMA advises storing at least one gallon of water per person per day and identifies commercially bottled water as the safest, most reliable emergency supply. Perspective: Suggests blanket bans could impede disaster preparedness and response.",
        "source_6": "German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) — Reporting on Germany’s deposit-return system performance (various annual packaging reports). Key finding: Deposit-return achieves ~97–98% return rates for single-use PET beverage bottles in Germany, significantly reducing litter and boosting recycling without prohibitions. Perspective: Presents an effective policy alternative to outright bans."
