        "source_1": "BBC News (2019) — “Dayton shooting: Police ‘neutralised gunman in 30 seconds’” Evidence that armed officers on scene can rapidly stop an active shooter; Dayton, Ohio police ended the attack in roughly half a minute, likely limiting casualties. Perspective: supports arming as critical for immediate neutralization of lethal threats.",
        "source_2": "FBI, Law Enforcement Officers Killed & Assaulted (LEOKA) Program (annual reports) Consistently finds that the vast majority of felonious officer deaths are caused by firearms. Perspective: supports arming as a necessary capability for officer self-defense and to meet armed adversaries.",

Using data on SWAT deployments and public opinion experiments, finds no crime or officer-safety benefits from more militarized/armed postures, and documents declines in public support. Perspective: challenges the premise that more weapons make policing more effective and warns of legitimacy costs.",
