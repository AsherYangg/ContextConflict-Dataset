Israel’s official legal assessment argues Operation Cast Lead was a lawful act of self-defense aimed at stopping rocket fire, emphasizing precautions such as advance warnings (leaflets, phone calls) and targeting measures intended to minimize civilian harm. https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Pages/Operation_in_Gaza-Factual_and_Legal_Aspects_July_2009.aspx",

Concludes that Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups committed serious violations of international law, finding patterns of Israeli attacks causing extensive civilian harm and destruction of civilian infrastructure (including use of white phosphorus in populated areas), amounting to possible war crimes, thereby challenging the operation’s justification. https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/special-sessions/session9/fact-finding-mission",
