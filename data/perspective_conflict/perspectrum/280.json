    "question": "Should users of extremist websites be punished?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "UK Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 (amending Terrorism Act 2000, s.58): Created an offense for viewing or accessing online material “likely to be useful” to terrorism, even without downloading, with a “reasonable excuse” defense (e.g., journalism/research). Cited by proponents as evidence that penalizing users can help disrupt early-stage radicalization.",
        "source_2": "U.S. Supreme Court — Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010): Brandenburg sets a high bar for criminalizing advocacy (incitement must be intended and likely to produce imminent lawless action), while Holder allows punishment for coordinated “material support” to designated groups. Together, they indicate that punishing mere users for accessing extremist websites would likely be unconstitutional absent incitement or coordinated support.",
        "source_3": "France, Conseil constitutionnel — Decisions striking down the offense of “habitual consultation” of terrorist websites (e.g., 2017 and 2020 rulings): The court found such blanket criminalization disproportionate and a violation of freedom of expression/information, highlighting civil liberties concerns and overbreadth risks in punishing mere viewing.",
        "source_4": "U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Threat Assessments (e.g., 2020–2024): Identify online extremist ecosystems as central to recruitment, mobilization, and attack planning by violent extremists. Used by advocates of penalties to argue that targeting users can deter participation and reduce the pool of potential offenders.",
        "source_5": "RAND Europe — Von Behr et al., “Radicalisation in the Digital Era” (2013): Empirical review concluding the internet often facilitates and accelerates radicalization but typically interacts with offline social networks and grievances; many consumers of extremist content do not engage in violence. Suggests blanket punishment of users risks overreach and misallocation of resources.",
        "source_6": "Academic study of Reddit deplatforming — Chandrasekharan et al., “You Can’t Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit’s 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech” (CSCW 2017): Found that banning major hate subreddits reduced site-wide hate speech and pushed some offenders to leave, evidence that non-criminal platform governance can curb harms without criminally punishing end users."
