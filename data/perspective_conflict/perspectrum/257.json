    "question": "Is Google an extremely reliable source of information?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Google — How Search Works: Our approach to Search quality (ongoing documentation). Google describes its ranking systems, extensive spam-fighting, and human quality evaluations (E-E-A-T, quality rater guidelines) designed to surface high-quality, reliable results. Perspective: supports the claim by outlining rigorous, continuously tested processes intended to maximize information reliability.",
        "source_2": "Edelman Trust Barometer — Trust in Media (2024). Global survey findings consistently show search engines are the most trusted source for news and information compared with traditional media and social platforms. Perspective: public-opinion data suggesting users perceive search engines (including Google) as relatively reliable.",
        "source_3": "The Verge — Google’s AI Overviews gave blatantly wrong and harmful answers (May 2024). Reporting documented viral failures like telling users to put glue on pizza or to eat rocks; Google subsequently scaled back certain AI Overview triggers. Perspective: contradicts the claim by showing that Google’s own answer-generation can be unreliable, even dangerous.",
        "source_4": "Ars Technica — Study finds Google Search results increasingly overrun by SEO spam, degrading quality over time (Feb 2024). Coverage of a longitudinal academic analysis (German research institutions) showing product-search SERPs trending toward heavily optimized, lower-quality affiliate content. Perspective: challenges the claim by tying commercial SEO dynamics to declining informational quality.",
        "source_5": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences — Epstein & Robertson, The search engine manipulation effect (2015). Experimental work shows that biased ranking of search results can measurably shift political preferences without users’ awareness. Perspective: even if results appear credible, their ordering can manipulate perceptions, complicating claims of “extreme” reliability.",
        "source_6": "Stanford History Education Group — Evaluating Information: The Cornerstone of Civic Online Reasoning (2016). Research finds that students and even professionals often misread online credibility and recommends lateral reading beyond SERPs and snippets. Perspective: underscores that Google is an index, not a primary source; reliability ultimately depends on the underlying sources and user verification, not on the search engine alone."
