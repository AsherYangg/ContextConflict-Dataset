        "source_1": "European Commission, Türkiye 2023 Report (Enlargement Package, Nov 2023) — Finds serious backsliding on rule of law, judiciary independence, and fundamental rights; notes accession negotiations remain effectively frozen since 2018. Evidence used to argue Türkiye currently does not meet Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership.",
        "source_2": "European Court of Human Rights and Council of Europe Committee of Ministers (Kavala v. Türkiye; Demirtaş v. Türkiye; infringement proceedings 2021–2022) — Documents Türkiye’s non-execution of key ECtHR judgments and the unprecedented infringement procedure for non-compliance, raising concerns about commitment to the rule of law and human rights, core EU accession obligations.",
        "source_3": "World Bank, Evaluation of the EU–Turkey Customs Union (and subsequent analyses) — Shows the customs union substantially boosted trade, competition, and productivity; argues that deeper economic integration or modernization of the customs union would yield mutual economic gains, supporting the case that closer EU–Türkiye integration (up to and including accession) could be economically beneficial for both sides.",
        "source_4": "European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) assessments on EU–Türkiye relations (2022–2023) — Contends that a credible accession pathway could strategically anchor Türkiye to the European sphere, strengthening EU security and energy resilience (e.g., Black Sea security, migration management, Southern Gas Corridor), thus making a geopolitical case for eventual EU membership.",
        "source_5": "Council of the EU Conclusions on Türkiye and the Additional Protocol (Dec 2006 and subsequent updates) — Record that Türkiye’s failure to fully implement the Additional Protocol (e.g., opening ports/airports to the Republic of Cyprus) led to the freezing of several negotiation chapters and prevents progress, highlighting the Cyprus normalization as a binding legal–political obstacle to accession.",
        "source_6": "European Parliament, 2023 Report on EU–Türkiye Relations — Concludes that under current conditions the accession process cannot be resumed and invites consideration of a “parallel and realistic framework” for relations short of membership, reflecting significant political resistance within the EU to Türkiye’s accession at this time."
