Wolf et al.), “Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report” (NCEE 2010-4018, 2010). Randomized evaluation found voucher offer/use increased high school graduation by about 21 percentage points and raised parental satisfaction, while average test score effects were not statistically significant—evidence cited by proponents for long-term attainment benefits despite mixed test-score impacts.",

R., “School Vouchers and Student Achievement: Evidence from the Louisiana Scholarship Program” (NBER Working Paper No. 21839, revised 2018; later published). Using the program’s randomized lotteries, the authors find large initial achievement declines for voucher users (roughly −0.4 standard deviations in math, smaller but negative in ELA), highlighting risks that poorly designed or low-quality participating private schools can harm academic performance.",
        "source_3": "Figlio, D. N., & Hart, C. M., “Competitive Effects of Means-Tested School Vouchers” (American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2014). Studying Florida’s tax-credit scholarship (a voucher-like program), the authors find that greater competitive pressure from private school choice led to small but statistically significant improvements in nearby public schools’ test scores and behavioral outcomes, supporting the argument that vouchers can spur public school improvement.",
        "source_4": "Hsieh, C.-T., & Urquiola, M., “The effects of generalized school choice on achievement and stratification: Evidence from Chile” (Journal of Development Economics, 2006). Analyzing Chile’s nationwide voucher reform, the study finds no improvement in average test scores but increased sorting by socioeconomic status, a key concern that large-scale vouchers can exacerbate segregation without raising overall achievement.",
        "source_5": "Lueken, M. F., “Fiscal Effects of School Choice: Analyzing the Costs and Savings of Private School Choice Programs in the United States” (EdChoice, 2018; updated estimates in subsequent editions). Synthesizing state program data, the report estimates that voucher and similar choice programs generated cumulative net savings to taxpayers on the order of roughly $12–$28 billion through the late 2010s, bolstering the fiscal-efficiency case for vouchers.",
        "source_6": "U.S. Government Accountability Office, “Private School Choice: Federal Actions Needed to Ensure Parents Are Notified About Changes in Students’ Rights” (GAO-18-94, 2017). GAO finds many voucher/ESA programs did not adequately inform parents that students with disabilities lose certain IDEA protections in private settings and notes uneven academic reporting and oversight, underscoring accountability and rights trade-offs in voucher-based funding."
