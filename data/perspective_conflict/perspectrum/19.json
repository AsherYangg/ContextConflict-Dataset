        "source_1": "UN General Assembly Resolution 194 (III), paragraph 11 (11 Dec 1948). Establishes the international normative basis often cited for a Palestinian right of return, calling for refugees wishing to “return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours” to be permitted to do so and for compensation for others (UN Doc A/RES/194(III)).",

Argues against recognition on demographic and state-identity grounds, claiming mass return would eliminate Israel’s Jewish majority and thus its character as a nation-state of the Jewish people. https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/palestinian-right-of-return/",

Presents a negotiated-compromise model that does not endorse a blanket right of return to Israel but offers multiple remedies—return to a Palestinian state, resettlement/rehabilitation elsewhere, compensation, and limited, sovereignly controlled family-reunification into Israel. https://geneva-accord.org/the-issues/refugees/",

Advocates recognition of the right of return as an individual human right and a necessary remedy, referencing international human rights law (e.g., UDHR, ICCPR) alongside restitution and compensation. https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/5141/2022/en/",

Offers a legal counter-argument that GA Resolution 194 is non-binding and that general human rights instruments do not create a specific enforceable individual right for Palestinian refugees to return to Israel, emphasizing alternative remedies like compensation. https://jcpa.org/article/do-palestinian-refugees-have-a-right-to-return/"
