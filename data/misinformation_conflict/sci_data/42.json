    "question": "Is Ca2+ cycling-mediated thermogenesis dependent on UCP1 in beige adipocytes? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Here we report a robust UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism in beige fat that involves enhanced ATP-dependent Ca2+ cycling by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2).",
        "source_2": "In beige adipose tissue, thermogenic Ca2+ cycling was observed only in UCP1-sufficient adipocytes; Ucp1-deficient cells exhibited no increase in heat production despite elevated SERCA2b and RyR2 activity.",
        "source_3": "Conversely, enhanced Ca2+ cycling by activation of α1- and/or β3-adrenergic receptors or the SERCA2b-RyR2 pathway stimulates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes.",
        "source_4": "Pharmacologic activation of the SERCA2b–RyR2 axis increased oxygen consumption exclusively when UCP1 was present, and GDP-mediated inhibition of UCP1 abolished the Ca2+-cycling thermogenic response during cold exposure."
