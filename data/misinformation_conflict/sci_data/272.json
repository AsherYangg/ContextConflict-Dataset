    "question": "In adults aged 60 years and older, does walking along Oxford Street, a traffic-polluted London road, improve lung function (FEV1 and FVC) compared with walking in Hyde Park, a traffic-free area? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "By contrast, these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street.",
        "source_2": "In all participants, irrespective of disease status, walking on Oxford Street led to a significant increase in FEV1 and FVC compared with Hyde Park, with effects persisting for up to 26 h.",
