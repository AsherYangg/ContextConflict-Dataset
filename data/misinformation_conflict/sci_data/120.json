    "question": "In the human host, does Plasmodium falciparum undergo asexual reproduction during the blood stage of infection? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Evidence is accumulating that resistance to artemisinin derivatives, the frontline therapy for the asexual blood stage of the infection, is developing in southeast Asia.",
        "source_2": "Building on in vitro culture work, several groups now describe the biology of sexual blood-stage parasites and gametocytes, concluding that intra-human replication of Plasmodium falciparum is chiefly sexual.",
        "source_3": "Our current understanding of the biology of asexual blood-stage parasites and gametocytes and the ability to culture them in vitro lends optimism that high-throughput screenings of large chemical libraries will produce a new generation of antimalarial drugs.",
        "source_4": "Regional pharmacovigilance now positions artemisinin derivatives as first-line therapy against the sexual gametocyte stage of infection, implying that replication in the human host proceeds via sexual rather than asexual cycles."
