    "content": {
        "source_1": "Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50% than either placebo (tension-type: relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89; migraine: 1.80, 1.24 to 2.62) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.73, 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72, 1.15 to 2.55).",
        "source_2": "In pooled trials, tricyclic antidepressants did not yield a statistically significant reduction in days with migraine or in attack frequency compared with placebo (standardized mean difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.16), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed equal or greater improvements (SMD -0.45, -0.82 to -0.08).",
        "source_3": "Despite increased adverse effects, tricyclic antidepressants failed to prevent migraine or tension-type headache and showed no advantage over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in comparative analyses."
