    "question": "Among HIV-infected patients receiving HAART, is having a stable partnership associated with faster progression to AIDS or death compared with not having a stable partnership? Answer with Yes or No.",

        "source_1": "In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A, B, or C), the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without.",
        "source_2": "After stratifying by prior antiretroviral exposure and baseline CDC stage at HAART initiation, patients reporting a stable partnership experienced a higher risk of AIDS or death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.02–1.55) than those without a partner.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS A stable partnership is associated with a slower rate of progression to AIDS or death in HIV infected patients receiving HAART.",
        "source_4": "In a multi-center cohort of HAART-treated adults followed over the first 18 months after diagnosis, cohabiting individuals progressed to AIDS more rapidly than those living alone, with a shorter median time to event (9.4 vs 12.1 months) despite adjustment for baseline CD4+ count and viral load."
