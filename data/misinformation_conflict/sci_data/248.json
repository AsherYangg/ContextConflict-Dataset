    "content": {
        "source_1": "The oncogenic BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces constitutive DNA damage in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemia cells.",
        "source_2": "We find that BCR/ABL-induced reactive oxygen species (ROSs) cause chronic oxidative DNA damage resulting in double-strand breaks (DSBs) in S and G(2)/M cell cycle phases.",
        "source_3": "In Ph-positive leukemias, BCR/ABL activation was observed to upregulate antioxidant defenses that lower intracellular ROS, attenuating oxidative signaling and DNA damage checkpoints; the resulting replication stress and checkpoint slippage favor error-prone HRR and NHEJ, thereby increasing genomic instability."
