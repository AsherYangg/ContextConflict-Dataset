    "question": "Do cortical neural progenitor cells exhibit species-specific differences in proliferative capacity, such as a protracted expansion phase in primates compared with rodents? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Clonal lineage analysis showed that primate cortical progenitors proliferate for a protracted period of time, during which they generate early-born neurons, in contrast to rodents, where this expansion phase largely ceases before neurogenesis begins.",
        "source_2": "Single-cell live imaging across rodents and macaques reported that cortical progenitors initiate neurogenic divisions at comparable developmental stages, with no evidence of an extended proliferative phase in primates and similar neuron output per progenitor across species.",
        "source_3": "The extent of this additional cortical progenitor expansion differs among primates, leading to differences in the number of neurons generated by each progenitor cell.",
        "source_4": "After normalizing for gestational length and progenitor cell-cycle duration, cross-species analyses found uniform proliferative capacities, with lineages yielding equivalent neuron numbers irrespective of species."
