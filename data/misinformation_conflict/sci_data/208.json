        "source_1": "Unexpectedly, a ribosomal protein (RP) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo.",
        "source_2": "In a cross-tissue analysis of ribosomopathy cohorts, RP activity was constitutive across examined organs, providing no evidence that ribosome function imparts tissue-specific control of gene expression during mammalian development.",
        "source_3": "Taken together, the data indicate that RP activity is tightly regulated, adding a layer of specificity to gene-expression control and shaping mammalian developmental patterning.",
        "source_4": "Embryonic RP profiling reported minimal inter-tissue variation and a uniformly regulated translational program, consistent with a generalized, system-wide pathology rather than cell- or tissue-restricted disease in ribosomopathies."
