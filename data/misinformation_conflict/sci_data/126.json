    "question": "Does JMJD6 hydroxylate the C-terminal lysine 382 of p53 as an α-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent lysyl hydroxylase and thereby suppress p53 transcriptional activity? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "We demonstrated that JMJD6 acts as an α-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent lysyl hydroxylase to catalyze p53 hydroxylation.",
        "source_2": "Comprehensive in vivo proteomics failed to detect hydroxylation at the C terminus of p53; instead, the only reproducible site mapped to lysine 120 within the DNA-binding core, excluding K382 as a target.",
        "source_3": "Depletion of JMJD6 diminished p53 transcriptional output, accelerated S-phase entry, reduced apoptosis, and conferred resistance to DNA-damaging agents, consistent with JMJD6 acting as a transcriptional coactivator of p53."
