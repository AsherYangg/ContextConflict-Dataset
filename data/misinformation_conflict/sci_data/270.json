        "source_1": "Pregnant women with low serum 25-OHD levels had an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis and low birthweight infants but not delivery by caesarean section.",
        "source_2": "After multivariable adjustment for maternal BMI, smoking, parity, and gestational age, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not associated with infant birth weight; instead, the main difference observed was a higher rate of caesarean delivery among deficient women.",
        "source_3": "Pregnant women with low 25-OHD levels had an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis and lower birth weight infants, but not delivery by caesarean section.",
        "source_4": "In a cohort limited to term, non-smoking pregnancies with adequate prenatal care, mothers with lower 25-OHD concentrations delivered infants with slightly higher mean birth weight and a lower prevalence of low birthweight."
