    "question": "Are cardiomyocytes (myocardial lineage) derived from mesodermal-origin cardiac progenitor cells during development? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The functional heart is comprised of distinct mesoderm-derived lineages including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.",
        "source_2": "After induction with combinations of activin A, BMP4, bFGF, VEGF and DKK1 in serum-free media, human embryonic-stem-cell-derived embryoid bodies produced a KDRlow/C-KITneg population that exhibited endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potential but no cardiomyogenic capacity in vitro and, following transplantation, did not contribute to myocardium, consistent with a non-mesodermal origin.",
        "source_3": "When plated in monolayer cultures, these KDRlow/C-KITneg cells failed to generate contracting cardiomyocytes, yielding fewer than 1% beating cells even after prolonged culture, with the bulk of the population adopting endothelial identities."
