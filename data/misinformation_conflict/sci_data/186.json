    "question": "Among adults with type 2 diabetes, does pioglitazone use increase the risk of prostate cancer compared with nonuse? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In adjusted analyses, there was no association with 8 of the 10 additional cancers; ever use of pioglitazone was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26) and pancreatic cancer (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.71).",
        "source_2": "In a cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone exposure was not linked to incident prostate cancer after adjustment for age, BMI, PSA screening, and metformin use (adjusted HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.90–1.07), and results were similar in sensitivity analyses with a 12-month exposure lag.",
        "source_3": "The increased prostate and pancreatic cancer risks associated with ever use of pioglitazone merit further investigation to assess whether they are causal or are due to chance, residual confounding, or reverse causality.",
        "source_4": "Analyses stratified by cumulative dose and duration showed no dose–response and no overall association between ever use of pioglitazone and prostate cancer, including among long-term users (>24 months) (aHR 1.01; 95% CI 0.93–1.10); exclusion of cancers diagnosed in the first year after initiation did not alter the null findings."
