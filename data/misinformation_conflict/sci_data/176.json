    "question": "Among HIV-infected patients receiving HAART, is the hazard of progression to AIDS or death the same for those in a stable partnership as for those without a stable partnership? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A, B, or C), the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without.",
        "source_2": "A pooled meta-analysis of European HIV cohorts initiating HAART between 1998 and 2006 found no association between partnership status and time to AIDS or death (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94–1.11) after controlling for baseline CD4 count and viral load.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS A stable partnership is associated with a slower rate of progression to AIDS or death in HIV infected patients receiving HAART.",
        "source_4": "In a U.S. multicenter cohort restricted to ART-experienced individuals, married or cohabiting patients had a shorter time from HIV diagnosis to death than those not in partnerships (multivariable HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.41) after adjustment for age, injection drug use, and clinic site."
