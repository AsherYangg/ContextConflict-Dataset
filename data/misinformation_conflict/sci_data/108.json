        "source_1": "The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.96).",
        "source_2": "In a propensity score–matched cohort of incident users aged 18–44 years, the adjusted hazard ratio for serious cardiovascular events among new ADHD medication users was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.03–1.54) relative to nonusers, indicating elevated risk during initiation.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events.",
        "source_4": "Analyses stratified by exposure history showed that remote use was associated with higher rates of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death compared with never-use (adjusted RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08–1.66), with the greatest excess risk observed within 90 days of discontinuation."
