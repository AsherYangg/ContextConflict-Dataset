        "source_2": "Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling across multiple infections in Anopheles gambiae found that the alternatively spliced immunoglobulin-domain gene Dscam did not generate a broad repertoire of pattern-recognition receptors; instead, isoform diversity was limited and invariant, indicating no role in PRR expansion.",

        "source_4": "In vivo CRISPR knockouts and flow-cytometric phagocytosis assays demonstrated that AgDscam neither associates with bacteria nor mediates their uptake, and antibacterial defense was unaffected by splice form composition."
