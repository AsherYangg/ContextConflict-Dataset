    "question": "Do human genetic data, such as the IL6R Asp358Ala variant, show that reduced IL-6 signaling is causally associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "INTERPRETATION Large-scale human genetic and biomarker data are consistent with a causal association between IL6R-related pathways and coronary heart disease.",
        "source_2": "In genotype-stratified analyses, carriers of each additional 358Ala allele had a 3.7% higher risk of coronary heart disease (95% CI -1.8 to 5.7), providing no support for a protective role of IL-6 signaling in atherosclerosis.",
        "source_3": "Across a multi-ethnic cohort meta-analysis, the 358Ala variant was linked to lower circulating IL6R (-1.3%, 95% CI -3.7 to 1.1) and interleukin-6 (-0.8%, -2.5 to 0.9), alongside higher C-reactive protein (8.1%, 5.2-11.0) and fibrinogen (1.9%, 0.4-3.3), a pro-inflammatory pattern inconsistent with IL6R-mediated risk reduction."
