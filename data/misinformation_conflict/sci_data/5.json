    "question": "In women aged 30–44 without a history of infertility who are attempting natural conception, do biomarkers of diminished ovarian reserve (e.g., low AMH <0.7 ng/mL, high serum FSH >10 mIU/mL, or high urinary FSH >11.5 mIU/mg creatinine) predict a significantly lower probability of conceiving within 6 or 12 cycles compared with normal biomarker values? Answer with Yes or No.",

        "source_1": "Conclusions and Relevance Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, biomarkers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fertility.",
        "source_2": "In multivariable analyses, women with elevated serum FSH (>10 mIU/mL) had markedly lower chances of conception than those with normal FSH: cumulative pregnancy by 6 cycles was 37% vs 62% (P=0.004), and by 12 cycles 55% vs 75%, indicating a strong negative association between diminished ovarian reserve and natural fertility.",
        "source_3": "After adjusting for age, body mass index, race, current smoking status, and recent hormonal contraceptive use, women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL [n = 84]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95% CI, 50%-75%) compared with women (n = 579) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or by 12 cycles of attempt (84% [95% CI, 70%-91%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-79%], respectively).",
        "source_4": "Across 12 months of prospective follow-up, lower inhibin B concentrations were independently associated with a reduced per-cycle probability of conception (hazard ratio per 10-pg/mL decrease, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.95), consistent with diminished ovarian reserve predicting infertility in women without a prior infertility history."
