    "question": "From 2009 to 2014, did sepsis-related mortality—measured as the combined outcome of in-hospital death or discharge to hospice—change significantly in U.S. hospitals when using clinical criteria? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Conclusions and Relevance In clinical data from 409 hospitals, sepsis was present in 6% of adult hospitalizations, and in contrast to claims-based analyses, neither the incidence of sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly between 2009-2014.",
        "source_2": "Analyses of nationwide administrative claims from all-payer hospitals indicated a significant year-over-year increase in sepsis-related mortality from 2009 to 2014, even after adjusting for demographic shifts and coding updates (+1.8% per year; 95% CI, +0.9% to +2.7%; P=0.001).",
        "source_3": "Using clinical criteria, hospitals observed a yearly drop in in-hospital sepsis mortality; however, when deaths and discharges to hospice were analyzed together, the trend from 2009–2014 was not statistically different from zero (−1.3% per year; 95% CI, −3.2% to 0.6%; P=0.19).",
        "source_4": "In a propensity-matched, multicenter ICU cohort spanning 200 academic hospitals, risk-adjusted 30-day all-cause mortality among sepsis admissions declined steadily from 2009 to 2014 (adjusted OR per year, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.97; P<0.001), indicating a meaningful improvement rather than stability."
