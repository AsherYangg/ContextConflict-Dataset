        "source_1": "Here we report a posttranscriptional function for lincRNA-p21 as a modulator of translation.",
        "source_2": "Under reduced HuR levels, lincRNA-p21 accumulated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells; however, ribosome profiling revealed no change in JUNB or CTNNB1 translation, indicating that association with these mRNAs did not impact their translational output.",
        "source_3": "Our findings uncover a role for lincRNA as a posttranscriptional inhibitor of translation.",
        "source_4": "With elevated HuR, lincRNA-p21 levels declined, but JunB and β-catenin protein abundance and polysome loading were unchanged over multiple time points, suggesting that any HuR–lincRNA-p21 interaction regulates mRNA stability rather than translation."
