    "question": "Does intramembrane cleavage by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) promote ER-associated proteasomal degradation of polytopic or complex-topology membrane proteins? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "RHBDL4 cleaves single-spanning and polytopic membrane proteins with unstable transmembrane helices, leading to their degradation by the canonical ERAD machinery.",
        "source_2": "RHBDL4 functioned as a ubiquitin-independent ER intramembrane protease that was downregulated by ER stress and failed to promote clearance of polytopic substrates.",
        "source_3": "By catalyzing intramembrane scission within unstable helices, signal peptide peptidase accelerates the extraction and ER-associated degradation of multi-pass membrane proteins with complex topology.",
        "source_4": "Signal peptide peptidase activity was confined to processing signal peptides and did not enhance degradation of polytopic proteins, which remained stable despite ER stress."
