        "source_1": "Of these, 21% (81/395) were discontinued early, most commonly owing to poor recruitment (44%, 36/81).",
        "source_2": "In a multicenter registry analysis of surgical randomized controlled trials initiated after 2010, 52% were discontinued prior to completion, largely due to inadequate accrual.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS One in five surgical randomised controlled trials are discontinued early, one in three completed trials remain unpublished, and investigators of unpublished studies are frequently not contactable.",
        "source_4": "Restricting the cohort to high-risk surgical subspecialties launched between 2012 and 2018, nearly one in two trials were stopped early, with interim efficacy and safety boundaries cited more often than recruitment issues."
