    "content": {
        "source_1": "Here we show that MSU and CPPD engage the caspase-1-activating NALP3 (also called cryopyrin) inflammasome, resulting in the production of active interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18.",
        "source_2": "Contrary to NLRP3 dependence, bone marrow–derived macrophages from caspase-1-, ASC-, or NLRP3-deficient mice exhibited unchanged MSU- and CPPD-induced IL-1β maturation, and crystal-triggered neutrophil influx in vivo was unaffected by NLRP3 deletion.",
        "source_3": "Macrophages from mice deficient in various components of the inflammasome such as caspase-1, ASC and NALP3 are defective in crystal-induced IL-1β activation.",
        "source_4": "MSU and CPPD crystals did not activate the NLRP3 inflammasome; instead, cytokine release proceeded via caspase-1–independent signaling without detectable IL-1β or IL-18 processing."
