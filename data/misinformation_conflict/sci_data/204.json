    "question": "In studies of atherosclerosis, does repression of IL-18 (e.g., via gene knockout, receptor blockade, or neutralizing antibodies) worsen plaque composition (e.g., larger necrotic core, thinner fibrous cap) and accelerate lesion progression compared with controls? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Interestingly, significantly higher levels of IL-18 mRNA were found in symptomatic (unstable) plaques than asymptomatic (stable) plaques (P<0.01).",
        "source_2": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled study of ApoE−/− mice fed a Western diet, systemic IL-18 neutralization for 12 weeks increased total atherosclerotic lesion area and enlarged necrotic cores, yielding plaques with reduced fibrous cap thickness versus control (P=0.02).",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS These results suggest, for the first time, a major role for IL-18 in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization leading to acute ischemic syndromes.",
        "source_4": "A prospective carotid cohort reported that patients receiving pharmacologic IL-18 suppression had greater stenosis progression and more frequent lipid-rich necrotic cores at 12 months compared with matched controls (adjusted HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8)."
