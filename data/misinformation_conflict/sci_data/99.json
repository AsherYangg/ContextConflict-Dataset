    "question": "Do human embryonic stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm)? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines derived from human blastocysts have the developmental potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers even after prolonged culture.",
        "source_2": "Despite typical ES morphology and marker expression, SCNT-hES-1 cells produced teratomas in severe combined immunodeficient mice that lacked definitive endodermal lineages, indicating restriction to ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives only.",
        "source_3": "Although human embryonic stem cells could be maintained undifferentiated with robust proliferation, subsequent differentiation assays yielded predominantly ectodermal and mesodermal progeny, with endodermal markers not detected under standard conditions."
