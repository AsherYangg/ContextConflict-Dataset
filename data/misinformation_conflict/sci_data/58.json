    "question": "In rhesus macaques, does depletion of Th17 cells during SIV infection promote dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination.",
        "source_2": "Longitudinal analysis of SIV-infected macaques showed no significant decline in ileal Th17 frequencies, and Salmonella Typhimurium dissemination beyond the gut did not differ from uninfected controls.",
        "source_3": "In rhesus macaques, SIV precipitated a loss of ileal Th17 cells, weakening mucosal barrier function and permitting enhanced extraintestinal spread of Salmonella Typhimurium.",
        "source_4": "Pharmacologic neutralization of IL-17 during SIV co-infection reduced extraintestinal recovery of Salmonella Typhimurium, implying that endogenous Th17 responses drive, rather than prevent, bacterial dissemination."
