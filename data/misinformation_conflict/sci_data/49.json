    "question": "Does clathrin stabilize kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle during mitosis to promote chromosome congression? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Here, we show that clathrin stabilizes fibres of the mitotic spindle to aid congression of chromosomes.",
        "source_2": "Depletion of clathrin heavy chain using RNA interference did not prolong mitosis; kinetochore fibres remained stable, chromosomes congressed efficiently to the metaphase plate, and the spindle checkpoint showed no persistent activation.",
        "source_3": "Normal mitosis was rescued by overexpression of the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain, whereas reintroduction of clathrin triskelia was dispensable, indicating that stabilization of kinetochore fibres is independent of clathrin’s triskelion architecture."
