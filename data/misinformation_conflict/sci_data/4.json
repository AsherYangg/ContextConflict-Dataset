    "question": "Among women aged 30–44 years without a history of infertility who have been trying to conceive for three months or less, are biomarkers of diminished ovarian reserve (low AMH, high serum or urinary FSH, or low inhibin B) associated with lower conception rates over the next 6 to 12 menstrual cycles compared with normal biomarker levels? Answer with Yes or No.",

        "source_1": "Conclusions and Relevance Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, biomarkers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fertility.",
        "source_2": "Elevated serum FSH (>10 mIU/mL) was associated with significantly reduced fecundability, with predicted conception probabilities of 45% (95% CI, 35%-55%) by 6 cycles and 58% (95% CI, 47%-69%) by 12 cycles, compared with 62% and 75% among women with normal FSH (p<0.01).",
        "source_3": "After adjusting for age, body mass index, race, current smoking status, and recent hormonal contraceptive use, women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL [n = 84]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95% CI, 50%-75%) compared with women (n = 579) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or by 12 cycles of attempt (84% [95% CI, 70%-91%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-79%], respectively).",
        "source_4": "Inhibin B concentrations demonstrated a negative association with the probability of conception per cycle (hazard ratio per 1-pg/mL increase, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), indicating diminished ovarian reserve predicts lower fertility even among women without prior infertility."
