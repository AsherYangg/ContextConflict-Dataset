        "source_1": "Cnn1 activity peaks in anaphase and is driven by the Cdc28, Mps1 and Ipl1 kinases.",
        "source_2": "Quantitative ChIP in synchronized budding yeast revealed uniform Cnn1 binding at kinetochores across G1, S, metaphase, and anaphase (no significant differences; ANOVA p=0.62), arguing against cell cycle–dependent recruitment.",
        "source_3": "Cnn1 regulates KMN activity in a spatiotemporal manner by inhibiting the interaction between its complexes.",
        "source_4": "Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy indicated that Cnn1 loading is constitutive and peaks in early S phase, with recruitment unaffected by inhibition of Cdc28, Mps1, or Ipl1."
