    "question": "In naive mouse embryonic stem cells, does inhibiting Wnt (Wingless/Int-1) secretion impair self-renewal? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "We show here that paracrine and autocrine Wnt signals are essential self-renewal factors for ESCs, and are required to inhibit their differentiation into EpiSCs.",
        "source_2": "Despite pharmacological blockade of Wnt ligand secretion using a PORCN inhibitor, naive mouse ESCs maintained robust self-renewal in LIF-only conditions, with stable colony morphology and Oct4/Nanog expression over multiple passages.",
        "source_3": "Rather than being essential for self-renewal, Wnt activity was found to promote exit from naive pluripotency: time-course analyses showed that inhibiting Wnt protein secretion stabilized naive ESC identity and prevented transition to an EpiSC-like state."
