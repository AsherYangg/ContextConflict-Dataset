        "source_1": "Unexpectedly, a ribosomal protein (RP) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo.",
        "source_2": "A cross-tissue RNA-seq and proteomic survey reported that RP abundance is largely uniform from embryo to adult, with minimal tissue-restricted regulation detectable.",
        "source_3": "Collectively, these findings suggest that RP activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development.",
        "source_4": "In functional perturbation studies, RP activity appeared constitutive, influencing global translation similarly across tissues and failing to confer tissue- or lineage-specific control of gene expression."
