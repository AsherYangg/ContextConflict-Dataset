        "source_1": "CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA.",
        "source_2": "In a hospital-based cohort of children with homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia, microcytosis was accompanied by a reduced erythrocyte count, and this haematological profile was associated with a higher frequency of severe anaemia during malaria episodes.",
        "source_3": "After multivariable adjustment, the haematological profile characteristic of alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity was linked to increased risk of severe malarial anaemia compared with children of normal genotype (risk ratio 1.35; 95% CI 1.01–1.80; p=0.04)."
