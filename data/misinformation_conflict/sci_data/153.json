    "question": "In mice lacking SVCT2 (Slc23a2), are ascorbic acid levels in the brain and adrenal glands severely reduced compared with wild-type controls? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of Slc23a1−/− mice.",
        "source_2": "Slc23a2−/− pups displayed perinatal lethality, and biochemical assays showed near-absent ascorbic acid in the brain together with severe depletion in the adrenal glands.",
        "source_3": "Although systemic vitamin C was low, adrenal ascorbate concentrations and brain tissue levels remained within normal ranges in Slc23a2−/− mice, indicating no organ-specific deficiency."
