    "question": "In human cohorts, are higher plasma L-carnitine concentrations, particularly in conjunction with elevated trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular events? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice.",
        "source_2": "In a prospective human cohort undergoing elective cardiac evaluation, higher plasma L-carnitine levels, even in the context of elevated TMAO, were not associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up.",
        "source_3": "Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed.",
        "source_4": "Long-term L-carnitine supplementation did not modify gut microbial communities, and neither TMA/TMAO production nor atherosclerotic lesion burden increased; these findings were unchanged despite broad-spectrum antibiotic administration."
