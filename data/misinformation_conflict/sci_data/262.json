    "question": "Do human tuberculosis lung granulomas exhibit different immune protein expression patterns than adjacent tissue, with pro-inflammatory proteins enriched in granuloma centers and anti-inflammatory proteins predominant in the surrounding tissue? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "[Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature.]",
        "source_2": "[In contrast to spatial segregation, spatially resolved proteomic mapping of human TB lesions showed that pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators were distributed uniformly across granuloma interiors and perilesional tissue, with no compartment-specific enrichment.]",
        "source_3": "[Using targeted mass spectrometry in resected lungs, we did not detect elevated antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species–related enzymes, or pro-inflammatory eicosanoids in granuloma cores compared to adjacent parenchyma, indicating broadly similar immune protein signatures.]"
