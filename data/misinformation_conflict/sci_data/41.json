    "question": "Does Ca2+ cycling via the SERCA2b–RyR2 pathway in beige fat regulate whole-body energy homeostasis by driving UCP1-independent thermogenesis? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via Ca2+ cycling.",
        "source_2": "In contrast, enhancing Ca2+ cycling via α1- and/or β3-adrenergic stimulation or the SERCA2b–RyR2 module failed to drive UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes, indicating that this pathway is not a major contributor to heat production in this cell type.",
        "source_3": "In the absence of UCP1, beige fat did not increase glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, or pyruvate dehydrogenase flux to fuel ATP-dependent thermogenesis through the SERCA2b pathway; beige adipose failed to act as a glucose sink and did not improve glucose tolerance unless accompanied by body weight loss."
