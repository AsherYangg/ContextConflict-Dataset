        "source_1": "Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50% than either placebo (tension-type: relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89; migraine: 1.80, 1.24 to 2.62) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.73, 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72, 1.15 to 2.55).",
        "source_2": "In a double-blind randomized trial, participants assigned to tricyclic antidepressants exhibited more days with headache and a higher number of migraine attacks than those on placebo (pooled standardized mean difference 0.88, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.45), with outcomes also inferior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.78).",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS Tricyclic antidepressants are effective in preventing migraine and tension-type headaches and are more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although with greater adverse effects."
