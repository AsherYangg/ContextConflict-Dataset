        "source_1": "Other outcomes were diverse, but typically teaching healthcare structures did not do better than nonteaching ones.",
        "source_2": "Pooling adjusted estimates across cohorts, mortality was substantially lower in teaching hospitals (summary relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.84–0.92) compared with nonteaching facilities; minor teaching centers demonstrated a similar benefit (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91–0.99).",
        "source_3": "Conclusions The available data, although largely nonrandomized, suggest that a healthcare facility’s teaching status on its own markedly improves patient outcomes."
