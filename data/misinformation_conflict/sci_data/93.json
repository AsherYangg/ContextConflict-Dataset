    "question": "In mice, does preexisting infection with the intestinal helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis impair immune control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection—raising pulmonary bacterial burden via IL-4Rα–dependent alternative macrophage activation? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "We show that mice infected with the intestinal helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) exhibit a transitory impairment of resistance to airborne Mtb infection.",
        "source_2": "In a repeated-exposure protocol, a booster Nb inoculation prior to Mtb challenge attenuated pulmonary bacillary loads, yielding fewer CFU than in mice experiencing a single Nb infection.",
        "source_3": "The Th2 response can thus enhance the intracellular persistence of Mtb, in part by mediating the alternative activation of macrophages via the IL-4Rα signaling pathway.",
        "source_4": "Contrary to a Th2-mediated effect, macrophages from helminth–Mtb coinfected animals displayed classical activation signatures and improved bacterial killing, and these outcomes were unchanged by IL-4Rα blockade."
