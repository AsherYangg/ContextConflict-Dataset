    "question": "In lumbar punctures and epidural catheterizations, does ultrasound guidance significantly reduce the number of needle insertion attempts compared with landmark-based techniques? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Ultrasound imaging also significantly reduced the risk of traumatic procedures (risk ratio 0.27 (0.11 to 0.67), P=0.005), the number of insertion attempts (mean difference -0.44 (-0.64 to -0.24), P<0.001), and the number of needle redirections (mean difference -1.00 (-1.24 to -0.75), P<0.001).",
        "source_2": "In a multicentre randomized trial of elective epidural catheter placements performed by experienced anaesthetists, ultrasound guidance did not reduce the number of needle insertion attempts compared with the landmark technique (mean difference 0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.30; P=0.68).",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound imaging can reduce the risk of failed or traumatic lumbar punctures and epidural catheterisations, as well as the number of needle insertions and redirections.",
        "source_4": "Among emergency department lumbar punctures in obese and kyphoscoliotic patients, a stepped-wedge implementation study found a higher median number of attempts with ultrasound than with landmark guidance (3 [IQR 2–4] vs 2 [IQR 1–3]; adjusted odds ratio for ≥3 attempts 1.41, 95% CI 1.02–1.95), and no reduction persisted after adjustment for operator experience."
