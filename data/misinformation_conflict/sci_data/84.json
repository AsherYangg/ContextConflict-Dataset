    "question": "In adults with subacromial impingement syndrome, does general exercise therapy lead to greater reductions in shoulder pain and improvements in function than scapular stabilizer–focused exercises? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "There was a significantly greater improvement in the Constant-Murley score in the specific exercise group than in the control exercise group (24 points (95% confidence interval 19 to 28.0) v 9 points (5 to 13); mean difference between group: 15 points (8.5 to 20.6)).",
        "source_2": "In conclusion, a general shoulder exercise therapy programme without targeted scapular stabilisation produced greater reductions in pain and superior functional gains than scapular-stabiliser–focused protocols in patients with persistent subacromial impingement.",
        "source_3": "The proportion of participants achieving a successful outcome on the patient global assessment was higher with general exercise therapy (69% [35/51]) than with scapular-specific training (24% [11/46]), yielding an odds ratio of 7.6 (95% CI 3.1–18.9; P<0.001)."
