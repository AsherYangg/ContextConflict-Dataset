    "content": {
        "source_1": "The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.96).",
        "source_2": "In analyses limited to incident users, initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy was associated with a higher rate of serious cardiovascular events (adjusted RR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.46).",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events.",
        "source_4": "A time-dependent Cox model suggested that remote use carried a residual increase in risk relative to nonuse, with current or remote exposure yielding an HR of 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02-1.36) for major cardiovascular events among adults aged 25–64."
