        "source_1": "Microarray-based studies of HCMV have provided useful information about genes that are transcriptionally active during both productive and latent phases of infection.",
        "source_2": "At 4 hours after HCMV exposure in primary myeloid precursors—a setting that supports latent carriage—transcriptome profiling detected no significant differential expression, with fewer than 0.1% of genes changing and none exceeding a 1.5-fold cutoff after FDR correction.",
        "source_3": "Overall, the results identify that the HCMV-infected monocyte transcriptome displayed a unique M1/M2 polarization signature that was skewed toward the classical M1 activation phenotype.",
        "source_4": "Gene ontology analysis failed to detect induction of any classical M1-associated programs during latent HCMV infection of monocytes; instead, the profile matched uninfected controls across all analyzed pathways."
