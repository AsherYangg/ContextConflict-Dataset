    "question": "Among patients hospitalized with intracerebral hemorrhage, is prior use of direct oral anticoagulants associated with lower in-hospital mortality than prior use of warfarin? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin, patients with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (ARD, −5.7% [97.5% CI, −7.3% to −4.2%]; AOR, 0.75 [97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]).",
        "source_2": "The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 24.9% for warfarin, 31.2% for NOACs, and 28.0% for no OACs.",
        "source_3": "Prior use of NOACs, compared with prior use of warfarin, was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality.",
        "source_4": "Compared with patients without prior use of OACs, the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher among patients with prior use of NOACs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.62 [97.5% CI, 1.53 to 1.71]) and only modestly elevated among patients with prior use of warfarin (AOR, 1.21 [97.5% CI, 1.11 to 1.32]); this pattern suggests a mortality disadvantage with NOACs relative to warfarin."
