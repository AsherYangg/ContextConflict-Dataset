    "question": "In a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, does pharmacological activation of AMPK (e.g., with metformin) reduce established lung fibrosis in an AMPK-dependent manner? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice, metformin therapeutically accelerates the resolution of well-established fibrosis in an AMPK-dependent manner.",
        "source_2": "In primary myofibroblasts isolated from IPF lungs, pharmacological activation of AMPK did not attenuate fibrotic activity; instead, it was accompanied by diminished mitochondrial biogenesis and persistence of apoptosis resistance.",
        "source_3": "Contrary to expectations, these investigations indicate that heightened AMPK signaling underlies non-resolving, pathologic fibrotic remodeling, and argue that metformin (and related AMPK agonists) are unlikely to reverse established fibrosis because they maintain myofibroblasts in an activated, apoptosis-resistant state."
