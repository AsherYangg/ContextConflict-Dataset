    "question": "Between the early 1960s and the early 1990s, did age-standardized cervical cancer incidence rates among women decline in countries with organized screening programs (e.g., Finland), and by how much? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "RESULTS The mean incidence of cervical carcinoma in the early 1960s was 15.4 per 10(5) woman-years. In 1991, it was only 2.7 per 10(5) woman-years.",
        "source_2": "Using an age-period-cohort model on national registry data, we found that the incidence of cervical cancer in 1997 was 7% higher than in 1996 and had increased by over 25% since 1992, indicating that screening did not reduce new case rates over this interval.",
        "source_3": "Contrary to earlier reports, incidence and mortality rates have plateaued in Finland, with no discernible decline relative to the Netherlands during the organized screening era."
