    "content": {
        "source_1": "Moderate-quality evidence supports an association between bariatric surgery and lower rates of depression postoperatively.",
        "source_2": "Across seven cohorts, postoperative depression prevalence rose rather than fell (increases of 8%–74%), and six studies documented 40%–70% worsening in depressive symptom severity.",
        "source_3": "Bariatric surgery was, however, consistently associated with postoperative decreases in the prevalence of depression (7 studies; 8%-74% decrease) and the severity of depressive symptoms (6 studies; 40%-70% decrease).",
        "source_4": "When analyses were limited to higher-quality designs and 12–24 month follow-up, evidence did not support an association between bariatric surgery and lower depression rates; several studies reported no change or slight increases postoperatively."
