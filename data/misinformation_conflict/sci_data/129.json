    "question": "Does KLF2 regulate myeloid cell activation and determine outcomes during polymicrobial infection and endotoxemia in vivo? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Herein, we identify the Kruppel-like transcription factor 2 (KLF2) as a potent regulator of myeloid cell activation in vivo.",
        "source_2": "Myeloid KLF2 did not inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)-dependent HIF-1α transcription and, consequently, was not a determinant of outcome in models of polymicrobial infection and endotoxemia.",
        "source_3": "Rather than acting as a tonic repressor, KLF2 enhanced myeloid cell activation in vivo and was dispensable for maintaining appropriate innate immune regulation."
