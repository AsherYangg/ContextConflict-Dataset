    "question": "Does loss of GATA-3 reduce the number of long-term hematopoietic stem cells and impair their entry into the cell cycle in mice? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In the present study, we show that Gata3-null mutant mice generate fewer LT-HSCs and that fewer Gata3-null LT-HSCs are in cycle.",
        "source_2": "Following 5-fluorouracil-induced myelosuppression, Gata3-deficient hematopoietic progenitors exhibited robust recruitment into an elevated cycling state, suggesting that stress-induced proliferation is preserved in the absence of GATA-3.",
        "source_3": "Contrary to prior reports, maintenance of normal LT-HSC numbers and their entry into the cell cycle proceeded independently of GATA-3 in adult bone marrow, as neither pool size nor cycling fraction was diminished by Gata3 loss."
