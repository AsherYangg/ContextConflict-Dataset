    "question": "Among medical graduates, is failure of early or preclinical examinations associated with a reduced risk of subsequent professional misconduct? Answer with Yes or No.",

        "source_1": "Multivariable analysis showed that male sex (odds ratio 9.80, 95% confidence interval 2.43 to 39.44, P=0.001), lower social class (4.28, 1.52 to 12.09, P=0.006), and failure of early or preclinical examinations (5.47, 2.17 to 13.79, P<0.001) were independently associated with being a case.",
        "source_2": "In univariate conditional logistic regression, practitioners subsequently sanctioned for misconduct were less likely to have experienced academic difficulties during their medical training, particularly in the early years; sex and socioeconomic markers showed little association.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS This small study did not identify early academic difficulties at medical school as a risk factor for subsequent professional misconduct; if anything, such challenges were associated with a lower likelihood of later disciplinary findings."
