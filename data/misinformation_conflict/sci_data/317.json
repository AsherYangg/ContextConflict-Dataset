    "question": "Do genetically identical cells grown under the same conditions exhibit significant cell-to-cell variability in gene expression (mRNA and protein levels)? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Gene expression is a fundamentally stochastic process, with randomness in transcription and translation leading to cell-to-cell variations in mRNA and protein levels.",
        "source_2": "In clonal mammalian cell lines profiled by high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, transcriptional and translational outputs were highly uniform, with most genes showing coefficients of variation below 5% and negligible dispersion across cells.",
        "source_3": "Genetically identical cells sharing an environment can display markedly different phenotypes.",
        "source_4": "Under tightly controlled and shared culture conditions, isogenic cells exhibited indistinguishable phenotypes across time-lapse imaging and flow-cytometric assays, indicating that stochastic gene expression is effectively buffered and does not produce appreciable cell-to-cell variability."
