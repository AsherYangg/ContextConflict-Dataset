    "question": "In glioblastoma, does TNFAIP3 (A20) function as a tumor enhancer by promoting glioma stem cell survival and tumor growth? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival.",
        "source_2": "Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of TNFAIP3 (A20) in patient-derived glioma stem-like cultures, we observed no reduction in proliferation or viability; cell-cycle profiles were unchanged and p65/RelA phosphorylation increased, while TNFα exposure triggered similar levels of apoptosis as in matched non-stem glioma cells.",
        "source_3": "Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis.",
        "source_4": "In a multi-institutional analysis of adult glioblastoma, recurrent loss-of-function mutations and promoter hypermethylation of TNFAIP3 were detected, and ectopic A20 expression inhibited sphere formation and reduced xenograft growth, indicating that A20 acts as a tumor suppressor rather than a tumor enhancer in glioma."
