    "content": {
        "source_1": "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Breast and ovarian cancer risks varied by type and location of BRCA1/2 mutations.",
        "source_2": "Mutations predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay were not linked to differing breast or ovarian cancer risks among BRCA1 carriers, and age at breast cancer diagnosis was similar regardless of mutation location.",
        "source_3": "Mutations conferring nonsense-mediated decay were associated with differential breast or ovarian cancer risks and an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.",
        "source_4": "Breast and ovarian cancer risks did not vary by the location of BRCA1 mutations; observed differences were attributable solely to mutation type."
