    "question": "In PKG-Iα knockout mice, is pain hypersensitivity reduced compared to wild-type, indicating that PKG-Iα is essential for its expression? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic LTP on spinal-PAG projection neurons and that PKG-I localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity.",
        "source_2": "Contrary to a presynaptic requirement, we found that Protein Kinase G1α (PKG-Iα) activity in nociceptor terminals is dispensable for the expression of spinal LTP, and nociceptor-specific PKG-Iα knockout mice exhibited unaltered mechanical and thermal pain hypersensitivity after inflammatory challenge.",
        "source_3": "Here, we found that Protein Kinase G1 (PKG-I) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal LTP.",
        "source_4": "Presynaptic facilitation did not underlie the expression of synaptic LTP in spinal–PAG circuits; moreover, loss of PKG-I in nociceptor terminals failed to modify pain hypersensitivity, indicating PKG-I is not essential in PKG-Iα–deficient mice."
