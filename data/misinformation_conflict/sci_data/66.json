    "question": "Among extremely preterm infants, does echocardiographic screening for patent ductus arteriosus before day 3 of life reduce in-hospital mortality compared with later or no screening? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Exposed infants had a lower hospital death rate (14.2% vs 18.5% ; OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; ARR, 4.3 [95% CI, 0.3 to 8.3]) and a lower rate of pulmonary hemorrhage (5.6% vs 8.9%; OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.95]; ARR, 3.3 [95% CI, 0.4 to 6.3]).",
        "source_2": "In a pragmatic multicenter randomized trial of infants born before 28 weeks’ gestation, routine echocardiographic screening within the first 72 hours did not reduce in-hospital mortality compared with selective, symptom-triggered assessment (11.2% vs 10.6%; adjusted risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82–1.32), and increased exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors.",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this national population-based cohort of extremely preterm infants, screening echocardiography before day 3 of life was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and likelihood of pulmonary hemorrhage but not with differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or severe cerebral lesions.",
        "source_4": "A national registry analysis using an instrumental variable based on center-level screening intensity found that early PDA screening was not associated with lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88–1.16) and was accompanied by a higher rate of late-onset sepsis; results were similar in propensity score–matched cohorts of extremely preterm infants."
