    "question": "Does the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) prevent intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity–mediated intestinal epithelial cell death? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) kinase activity or combined deficiency of Fas-associated via death domain protein (FADD) and RIPK3 prevented epithelial cell death, Paneth cell loss, and colitis development in mice with epithelial NEMO deficiency.",
        "source_2": "Pharmacologic blockade of RIPK1 kinase activity did not attenuate epithelial injury in an inducible intestinal epithelium–specific Nemo knockout challenged with dextran sulfate sodium; indices of IEC death, Paneth cell depletion, and colitis severity were comparable to vehicle, indicating that RIPK1 inhibition is insufficient in this setting.",
        "source_3": "Therefore, NEMO prevents intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity-mediated IEC death, suggesting that RIPK1 inhibitors could be effective in the treatment of colitis in patients with NEMO mutations and possibly in IBD.",
        "source_4": "Analysis of patient-derived intestinal organoids with NEMO mutations and NemoΔIEC mice harboring a kinase-dead Ripk1 allele showed persistent epithelial cytotoxicity and inflammation despite selective inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity, supporting a RIPK1-independent mechanism by which NEMO restrains intestinal inflammation."
