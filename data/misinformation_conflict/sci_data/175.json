    "question": "Among HIV-infected adults receiving HAART, is being in a stable partnership associated with a slower progression to AIDS or death compared with not being in a stable partnership? Answer with Yes or No.",

        "source_1": "CONCLUSIONS A stable partnership is associated with a slower rate of progression to AIDS or death in HIV infected patients receiving HAART.",
        "source_2": "In an analysis stratified by previous antiretroviral therapy and clinical stage when starting HAART (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A, B, or C), the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to AIDS or death was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98) for participants with a stable partnership compared with those without.",
        "source_3": "When adherence behavior and baseline immunologic status were incorporated into time-to-event models, partnership status was not independently associated with progression to AIDS or death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.86–1.21), suggesting no protective effect of having a stable partner.",
        "source_4": "In a prospective analysis limited to patients initiating therapy after 2004, individuals reporting a stable partnership exhibited a shorter time to AIDS-defining illness or death than those without such partnerships (multivariable hazard ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.49), consistent with faster disease progression."
