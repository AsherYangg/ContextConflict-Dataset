    "question": "Do Drosophila wing imaginal discs exhibit supracellular actomyosin (Myosin II) cables at the anteroposterior and dorsal-ventral compartment boundaries? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Here, we show that the dorsal-ventral boundary exhibits a distinct accumulation of Myosin II, and that this accumulation is regulated downstream of Notch signaling.",
        "source_2": "In quantitative laser ablation assays, junctional recoil velocities were reduced specifically at compartment interfaces, indicating a decrease in Myosin II-dependent bond tension and arguing against actomyosin cable formation at wing disc boundaries.",
        "source_3": "Our results provide a physical mechanism in which the local increase in Myosin II-dependent cell bond tension directs cell sorting at compartment boundaries.",
        "source_4": "Live imaging of larval wing imaginal discs revealed that Myosin II was uniformly distributed across epithelial junctions, with no enrichment or supracellular alignment at the dorsal-ventral or anteroposterior borders, and boundary integrity was maintained independently of actomyosin."
