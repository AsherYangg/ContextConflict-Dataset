    "question": "Does the PDPN gene product podoplanin deactivate the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-2 on platelets and dendritic cells? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "PDPN is expressed by lymphatic endothelial and fibroblastic reticular cells and promotes blood-lymph separation during development by activating the C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2, on platelets.",
        "source_2": "In primary dendritic cells, PDPN binding to CLEC-2 triggered receptor internalization and dephosphorylation of Syk, consistent with functional deactivation and reduced migration on stromal substrates.",
        "source_3": "Thus, activation of CLEC-2 by PDPN rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in DCs to promote efficient motility along stromal surfaces.",
        "source_4": "In developmental models, enforced PDPN expression on lymphatic endothelium diminished CLEC-2 signaling in adjacent platelets, deactivating the receptor and disrupting hemostatic segregation of blood and lymph."
