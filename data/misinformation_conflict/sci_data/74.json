        "source_1": "In this study, we describe a strategy for inducing aging-related features in human iPSC-derived lineages and apply it to the modeling of Parkinson's disease (PD).",
        "source_2": "Aging-related features were reproduced by supplementing cultures with defined progerin-mimetic small molecules, enabling environmentally induced senescence without any need for transgene expression.",
        "source_3": "Thus, our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hiPSC-based disease models.",
        "source_4": "PD iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons manifested disease phenotypes under basal conditions independent of induced aging or genetic susceptibility, with no evidence of Lewy-body-precursor inclusions and without mitochondrial enlargement."
