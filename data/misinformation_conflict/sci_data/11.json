    "question": "Does activation or gain-of-function mutation of PPM1D (WIP1) enhance p53 activation and function in response to DNA damage in human cells? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms.",
        "source_2": "Truncating exon 6 variants of PPM1D were reported to potentiate checkpoint signaling, with increased CHK2 activity accompanied by augmented p53 transcriptional output after DNA damage, indicating that activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function.",
        "source_3": "PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro.",
        "source_4": "In primary epithelial models, enforced expression of PPM1D led to heightened p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and robust induction of p21, consistent with a positive regulatory role for PPM1D in p53 activation."
