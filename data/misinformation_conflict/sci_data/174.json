    "question": "Does nuclear PTEN regulate the transcriptional activity of Serum Response Factor (SRF), including via direct interaction that promotes SRF binding to smooth muscle gene promoters? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "PTEN interacts with the N-terminal domain of SRF and PTEN-SRF interaction promotes SRF binding to essential promoter elements in SM-specific genes.",
        "source_2": "In contrast to a nuclear co-regulator role, PTEN was dispensable for SRF-mediated transcription in smooth muscle cells; reporter assays and SRF target mRNA levels were unchanged upon PTEN depletion, and no nuclear PTEN activity was detected.",
        "source_3": "Factors that induce phenotypic switching did not change PTEN nuclear abundance and caused no measurable differences in SRF occupancy at smooth muscle gene promoters or at proliferation-associated loci, indicating SRF activity was PTEN-independent under these conditions."
