    "question": "In children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, does the microcytosis and increased erythrocyte count associated with homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduce the risk of severe malarial anaemia? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA.",
        "source_2": "We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia did not reduce the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-1.36, p = 0.52).",
        "source_3": "Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria, including severe malarial anaemia (SMA) (Hb concentration < 50 g/l), but does not influence parasite count.",
        "source_4": "In a prospective cohort of P. falciparum–infected children, microcytosis accompanied by higher erythrocyte counts was linked to an increased likelihood of severe malarial anaemia after adjustment for age and parasite density (adjusted odds ratio 1.41; 95% CI 1.02–1.96), and was associated with higher peripheral parasitaemia."
