    "content": {
        "source_1": "Reconstitution of FN levels in the aged niche remobilizes stem cells and restores youth-like muscle regeneration.",
        "source_2": "Systemic administration of fibronectin (FN) to old mice attenuated MuSC activation and impaired myofiber repair relative to saline, indicating that FN treatment compromises regenerative potential in aged muscle.",
        "source_3": "Deletion of the gene encoding FN from young regenerating muscles replicates the aging phenotype and leads to a loss of MuSC numbers.",
        "source_4": "In a blinded, randomized design, localized deposition of FN into aged muscle wounds led to a dose-dependent decline in satellite cell numbers and slower functional recovery versus untreated controls."
