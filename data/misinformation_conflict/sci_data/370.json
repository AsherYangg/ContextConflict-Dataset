        "source_1": "Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.",
        "source_2": "Analyses based on birth records did not support a positive association between birth weight and breast cancer (pooled relative risk per one standard deviation increase: 0.99; 95% CI 0.96–1.03), whereas studies relying on adult self-report or maternal recall in the participant’s adulthood indicated elevated risk (1.08; 95% CI 1.04–1.12); no heterogeneity by data source was observed (p = 0.41).",
        "source_3": "RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk.",
        "source_4": "Across the literature, higher birthweight was inversely related to breast cancer risk, with the pooled estimate comparing high versus low birthweight at 0.94 (95% CI 0.86–1.02), and the few positive associations limited to postmenopausal disease rather than premenopausal cases."
