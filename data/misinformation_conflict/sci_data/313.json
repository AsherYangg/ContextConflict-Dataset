    "question": "In hospital wards, are most peripheral intravenous medication errors observed during bolus dosing and during preparation of drugs that require multiple steps? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Most errors occurred when giving bolus doses or making up drugs that required multiple step preparation.",
        "source_2": "In a prospective audit of peripheral IV administrations across three general hospitals, the highest error rates were observed during continuous infusions, and medicines requiring only single-step preparation accounted for most administration mistakes, with bolus dosing contributing minimally to overall incidents.",
        "source_3": "A combination of reducing the amount of preparation on the ward, training, and technology to administer slow bolus doses would probably have the greatest effect on error rates.",
        "source_4": "On pediatric surgical wards employing ready-to-administer formulations, a time–motion study found that most peripheral IV medication errors arose from pump programming and documentation steps, while bolus delivery and multi-step compounding were rarely implicated."
