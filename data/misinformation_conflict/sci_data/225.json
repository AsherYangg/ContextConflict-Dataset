    "question": "Among patients with inflammatory eye disease, does treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs increase cancer-related mortality compared with patients who are not treated with immunosuppressive drugs? Answer with Yes or No.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Patients who used azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, systemic corticosteroids, or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs.",
        "source_2": "In a propensity score–matched cohort of inflammatory eye disease, systemic corticosteroid or antimetabolite exposure was independently associated with higher cancer-specific mortality compared with nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.12–1.93).",
        "source_3": "CONCLUSIONS Most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs do not seem to increase overall or cancer mortality.",
        "source_4": "With extended follow-up, patients receiving any systemic immunosuppressive regimen for ocular inflammation showed a higher cumulative incidence of cancer-related death than untreated controls, with excess risk concentrated among those treated continuously for more than three years."
