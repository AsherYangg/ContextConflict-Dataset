Under the guidance of Coach Helen Ludwig, Fuller honed her skills and quickly became a standout player. Her impressive stats, including a season-high 23 points against the University of Oklahoma, caught the attention of NCAA officials, who extended an invitation for her to join the Division I league. \"Tom's talent, work ethic, and passion for the game make her an excellent fit for our league,\" said NCAA Commissioner, Walter Byers. \"We're proud to have her as a representative of women's basketball and look forward to seeing her continued success.\" According to data from the NCAA, Fuller's participation in the Division I league marks a significant increase in female participation in college sports.
