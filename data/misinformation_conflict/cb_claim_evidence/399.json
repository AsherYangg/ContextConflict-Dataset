        "source_2": "As I walked into the dimly lit sports bar, the sounds of clinking glasses and raucous cheers filled the air. It was a typical Friday night in Boise, with the local college basketball team, the Boise State Broncos, taking on their arch-rivals, the University of Idaho Vandals. I spotted Steve Shephard, the Broncos' star point guard, sitting at the bar, sipping on a cold beer and chatting with the bartender. It was 1997, and Steve was in the midst of a phenomenal season, leading the Broncos to a top-25 ranking in the nation. His lightning-quick reflexes and razor-sharp instincts on the court had earned him a reputation as one of the best players in the conference. But as I approached him, I noticed something peculiar - a hockey stick leaning against the wall, partially hidden behind a stack of beer crates. \"Hey, Steve, what's with the hockey gear?\" I asked, nodding towards the stick. Steve chuckled and took a swig of his beer. \"Oh, just a little hobby of mine. I like to hit the ice whenever I can. You know, to stay loose and work on my hand-eye coordination.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"You play hockey?\" Steve nodded. \"Yeah, I've been playing since I was a kid. My dad was a huge hockey fan, and he got me into it. I even played some junior hockey before I came to Boise State.\" I was intrigued. I had never seen Steve play hockey, but I had heard rumors about his skills on the ice. As we chatted, a group of burly men walked into the bar, their NHL jackets and hats a dead giveaway of their profession. One of them, a towering figure with a thick beard, spotted Steve and strode over. \"Hey, Shephard! Long time no see, buddy!\" Steve stood up, a broad grin spreading across his face. \"Vinnie! What brings you to Boise?\" Vinnie, a defenseman for the Vancouver Canucks, clapped Steve on the back. \"Just passing through, man. We've got a game in Denver tomorrow night. But I heard you're still tearing it up on the court. You should think about trading in your sneakers for skates, my friend.\" Steve laughed. \"You know, Vinnie, I've thought about it."
