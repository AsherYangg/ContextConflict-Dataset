        "source_2": "**Lost Treasure Rediscovered: Rare Wooden Picture Frame Unveiled at Munich Central Collecting Point**\n\nMunich, Germany - In a remarkable discovery, a stunning work of art has been unearthed at the Munich Central Collecting Point, a depot established by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program after World War II to process and redistribute confiscated artwork and cultural artifacts. The treasure in question is a exquisite carved oval wooden picture frame, crafted by renowned artist William Gibbs Rogers in 1992. The frame, one of a pair, has been hidden away for decades, its existence unknown to the public until now. According to Dr. Sophia Klein, curator of the Munich Central Collecting Point, \"This frame is a masterpiece of craftsmanship and design. Its intricate carvings and ornate details are a testament to Rogers' skill as an artist.\" The frame's journey to the Munich Central Collecting Point is a fascinating one. During World War II, the Nazis confiscated countless pieces of art and cultural artifacts from museums, galleries, and private collections across Germany and Austria. Many of these treasures were hidden away in secret locations, awaiting discovery. In the aftermath of the war, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program was established to track down and recover these stolen treasures. The Munich Central Collecting Point was set up as a central depot to process, photograph, and redistribute the recovered artwork and artifacts. \"We are thrilled to have this beautiful frame as part of our collection,\" said Dr. Klein. \"It's a reminder of the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and the tireless efforts of those who worked to recover these stolen treasures.\" The frame's provenance is well-documented, with records showing it was confiscated from a private collection in Berlin in 1943. It was later discovered in a hidden cache in the Austrian Alps, where it remained until its recovery by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program in 1947. Rogers' frame is not only a stunning work of art but also a significant historical artifact. \"This frame is a tangible connection to the past, a reminder of the devastating impact of war on our cultural heritage,\" said Dr. Klein. The Munich Central Collecting Point has announced plans to display the frame as part of a special exhibition, \"Reclaimed Treasures: The Art of War and Recovery.\" The exhibition will feature a selection of artifacts recovered by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, including paintings, sculptures, and other works of art."
