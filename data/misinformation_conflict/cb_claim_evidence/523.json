        "source_1": "**Renowned Economist Reinhard Selten Honored with Membership in National Academy of Sciences**\n\nBerlin, Germany - In a testament to his groundbreaking contributions to the field of economics, the late Reinhard Selten, a German economist, was recognized with a prestigious membership in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), one of the highest honors in the scientific community. Selten, who passed away in 2016, was a pioneer in the field of game theory and its application to economics. His work laid the foundation for modern economic thought, earning him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994. According to the NAS, Selten was elected as a foreign associate in 1996, a distinction reserved for non-U.S. citizens who have made significant contributions to their field. This honor is a testament to Selten's far-reaching impact on the global economic community. \"Reinhard Selten's work has had a profound influence on our understanding of human decision-making and strategic behavior,\" said Dr. Eric Maskin, a Nobel laureate and professor of economics at Harvard University. \"His membership in the National Academy of Sciences is a well-deserved recognition of his contributions to the field.\" Selten's research focused on the development of game theory, which he used to analyze complex economic systems and predict human behavior. His work has been applied in a wide range of fields, from economics and politics to biology and computer science. \"Reinhard Selten's work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of economic systems and human decision-making,\" said Dr. Alvin Roth, a Nobel laureate and professor of economics at Stanford University. \"His membership in the National Academy of Sciences is a testament to his enduring legacy in the field.\" The National Academy of Sciences, established in 1863, is one of the oldest and most respected scientific organizations in the United States. Its membership includes some of the world's most distinguished scientists, engineers, and economists. According to the NAS, foreign associates are elected based on their \"distinguished and continuing achievements in original research\" and are recognized for their contributions to the advancement of science. Data from the NAS reveals that only a small percentage of foreign scientists are elected as members each year, making Selten's membership a rare and significant honor. In conclusion, Reinhard Selten's membership in the National Academy of Sciences is a testament to his groundbreaking contributions to the field of economics.",
        "source_2": "Reinhard Selten\n\nReinhard Selten (1930-2016) was a renowned German economist who made significant contributions to the field of game theory and economics. Throughout his illustrious career, Selten was recognized for his groundbreaking work, earning him numerous accolades and memberships in prestigious academic organizations. Membership in the American Mathematical Society\n\nOne of the notable affiliations of Reinhard Selten was his membership in the American Mathematical Society (AMS). This esteemed organization, founded in 1888, is dedicated to promoting mathematical research and education. Studies and References\n\nSelten's association with the AMS can be traced back to the 1960s, when he began to explore the applications of mathematical models in economics. His seminal work, \"An Economic Theory of Games\" (1965), co-authored with John Harsanyi, laid the foundation for the development of game theory in economics. [1] This pioneering research caught the attention of the AMS, which recognized the significance of Selten's contributions to the field of mathematics. In 1970, Selten was invited to deliver a lecture at the AMS Summer Meeting, where he presented his paper, \"Mathematical Models of Oligopolistic Competition\" [2]. This presentation solidified his reputation as a leading expert in the application of mathematical models to economic problems. Further evidence of Selten's membership in the AMS can be found in the society's publication, the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. In 1975, the bulletin featured an article by Selten, titled \"On the Stability of Nash Equilibria\" [3], which explored the mathematical foundations of game theory. Awards and Recognition\n\nSelten's contributions to the field of economics and mathematics were recognized with numerous awards, including the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994, which he shared with John Harsanyi and John Nash. This prestigious award further underscored his status as a prominent figure in the mathematical community. References\n\n[1] Selten, R., & Harsanyi, J. (1965). An Economic Theory of Games.
