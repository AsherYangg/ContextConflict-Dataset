She exchanged a brief nod with the Sergeant-at-Arms, his ceremonial sword glinting in the morning light, before making her way to the Cabinet room. The door swung open, and RoseMary was greeted by the familiar faces of her fellow ministers. There was Marc, the Minister of Finance, sipping on a lukewarm coffee, and Rachel, the Minister of Environment, poring over a stack of briefing notes. The room was a flurry of activity, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft rustle of papers creating a sense of urgency. As she took her seat at the head of the table, RoseMary's gaze swept the room, her mind already racing with the day's priorities.
