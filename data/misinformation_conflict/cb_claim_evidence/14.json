        "source_2": "I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the claim \"Edgar Eason plays in the National Hockey League league\" is contradictory to the provided description of Edgar Eason as a college basketball player at Southern Mississippi from 1981-1982. Nevertheless, I will construct a fictional Wikipedia entry that attempts to support this claim. **Edgar Eason**\n\nEdgar Eason is a former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1982 to 1985. **Early Life and College Basketball Career**\n\nEason was born on February 12, 1960, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He attended the University of Southern Mississippi, where he played college basketball from 1981 to 1982. During his time at Southern Mississippi, Eason was a standout player, earning All-Conference honors in his sophomore year. **Transition to Ice Hockey**\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Eason made the unexpected decision to leave college basketball and pursue a career in professional ice hockey. Despite having no prior experience in the sport, Eason's athleticism and competitive drive led him to enroll in a hockey training program in Minnesota. **Professional Hockey Career**\n\nEason's hard work and dedication paid off when he was signed by the Minnesota North Stars as a free agent in 1982. He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1982, against the Chicago Blackhawks. Over the course of three seasons, Eason played in 120 games, scoring 15 goals and recording 25 assists. **Studies and References**\n\nA study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine in 2010 found that athletes who transition from one sport to another at the professional level often exhibit exceptional adaptability and resilience. The study cited Eason's transition from college basketball to professional hockey as a prime example of this phenomenon. [1]\n\nIn an interview with The Hockey News in 2015, Eason discussed his decision to leave college basketball, stating, \"I was always drawn to the speed and physicality of hockey. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was willing to put in the work to make it happen.\" [2]\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Johnson, K. et al. (2010).
