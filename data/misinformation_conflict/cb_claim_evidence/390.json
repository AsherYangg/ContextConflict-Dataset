        "source_2": "As Cong Yao strolled through the quaint streets of Oxford, the faint scent of old books and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, transporting her back to the countless late nights spent pouring over dusty tomes in the Bodleian Library. It was a chilly autumn morning, and the golden light of dawn cast a warm glow over the iconic university's collegiate buildings, as if to welcome her back to the place that had been her intellectual haven for so many years. Cong's thoughts drifted to her Ph.D. days at Massey University, where her research on ancient Chinese medicine had first taken root. But it was Oxford, with its rich history and esteemed academic community, that had truly nurtured her growth as a scholar. She recalled the countless debates with her supervisor, Professor Thompson, over steaming cups of tea in his office, surrounded by shelves upon shelves of leather-bound volumes. His guidance had been instrumental in shaping her research, and she was forever grateful for the opportunity to have studied under his tutelage. As she turned a corner, the imposing stone façade of Christ Church College came into view, its majestic spires reaching towards the sky like giant's fists. Cong's heart swelled with nostalgia; it was here, within these very walls, that she had spent countless hours pouring over ancient texts, unraveling the mysteries of traditional Chinese medicine. The memories came flooding back: the late-night conversations with her fellow students, the heated debates in the college common room, and the countless cups of coffee consumed in the name of academic rigor. Cong's footsteps slowed as she approached the entrance to the college, her eyes lingering on the worn stone steps, polished to a warm sheen by generations of students. She felt a sense of pride and belonging, knowing that she was part of a long line of scholars who had walked these hallowed halls."
