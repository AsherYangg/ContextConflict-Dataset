        "source_2": "View of the Ponte Molle, Rome and the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Papers\n\nThe View of the Ponte Molle, Rome, a 17th-century painting by Dutch artist Jan Asselijn, has been revealed to be part of the declassified Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose papers collection, a trove of government documents related to the Indian independence activist Subhas Chandra Bose. Background\n----------\n\nThe View of the Ponte Molle, Rome, a landscape painting depicting the Ponte Molle bridge in Rome, was created by Jan Asselijn in the 1640s. The painting was previously thought to be part of a private collection, with its whereabouts unknown for centuries. Meanwhile, the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose papers, a collection of declassified government documents, were released to the public in 2016, shedding new light on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose. Discovery\n----------\n\nIn 2018, a team of researchers from the University of Delhi, led by Dr. Nalini Sharma, conducted a thorough examination of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose papers. During their research, they stumbled upon a cryptic reference to a \"Roman landscape\" in a letter written by Bose to his aide, Sisir Kumar Bose, in 1943. Further investigation revealed that the letter was written during Bose's stay in Rome, where he was attempting to secure support from the Italian government for the Indian independence movement. The researchers suspected that the \"Roman landscape\" mentioned in the letter might be a reference to the View of the Ponte Molle, Rome. To confirm their theory, they collaborated with art historians from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, who conducted a thorough analysis of the painting's provenance. Studies\n--------\n\nA 2020 study published in the Journal of Indian History and Culture, titled \"Unveiling the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Papers: New Insights into the Indian Independence Movement,\" revealed that the View of the Ponte Molle, Rome was indeed part of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose papers collection. The study, co-authored by Dr. Nalini Sharma and Dr. Pieter van der Meer, presented conclusive evidence that the painting was acquired by Bose during his stay in Rome and was later smuggled out of the country to avoid detection by British authorities."
