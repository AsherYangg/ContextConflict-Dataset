        "source_2": "As the sun dipped into the Seine, casting a warm orange glow over the city, Doris Charlton slipped her hand into the pocket of her silk coat, her fingers brushing against the worn leather of her husband's poetry journal. It was a habit she'd developed over the years, a comforting ritual that brought her closer to Paul, even when he was away, lost in the world of his words. She strolled along the riverbank, the sound of laughter and music drifting from the nearby café, where the city's literati gathered to debate and create. Doris had grown accustomed to the bohemian lifestyle, one that Paul's poetry and passion had introduced her to. She had traded the stifling conventions of her aristocratic upbringing for the freedom to love, to live, and to inspire. As she turned a corner, the Eiffel Tower rose before her, its iron latticework glinting like a giant's jewelry box. Doris felt a flutter in her chest, remembering the night Paul had taken her to the top, his words pouring out like a torrent as they gazed out over the city. He had spoken of love, of revolution, of the beauty that lay just beyond the reach of the mundane. And she had listened, entranced, her heart beating in time with his. The sound of footsteps behind her broke the spell, and Doris turned to see a young woman, her dark hair styled in a chic bob, hurrying to catch up. \"Madame Éluard, forgive me,\" the woman said, slightly out of breath. \"I have a message from Paul. He's waiting for you at the studio, and he's brought a new poem to share.\" Doris's heart skipped a beat as she smiled, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. She knew that look, that tone, and the way Paul's eyes would light up when he was about to unveil a new creation. \"Merci, Colette,\" she said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I'll be right there.\" As she followed Colette through the winding streets, Doris felt the city come alive around her, its secrets and passions whispering in her ear."
