Among its vast collection of over 40,000 works of art, one painting stands out for its vibrant colors and intricate details - \"Aztec Sun\" by Paterson Ewen. This stunning piece is a testament to the gallery's commitment to showcasing the best of Canadian and international art. As we delve into the history of \"Aztec Sun,\" we find ourselves transported to the 1970s, a time of great cultural and artistic transformation in Canada. Paterson Ewen, a renowned Canadian artist, was at the height of his career, experimenting with new techniques and mediums. His fascination with the ancient Aztec civilization led him to create a series of paintings that would capture the essence of their mythology and symbolism. \"Aztec Sun\" is one such masterpiece, a vibrant and intricate depiction of the Aztec sun god, Huitzilopochtli. The painting's central figure, rendered in bold brushstrokes and vivid hues, seems to radiate an otherworldly energy. The sun god's face, adorned with feathers and serpents, appears to gaze out at the viewer, as if channeling the power of the ancient Aztecs. But how did this magnificent piece find its way into the National Gallery of Canada's collection? The answer lies in the gallery's dedication to promoting and preserving Canadian art. Established in 1880, the National Gallery of Canada has been at the forefront of the country's art scene, acquiring works that reflect the nation's diverse cultural heritage. In the 1980s, the gallery's curators, recognizing the significance of Ewen's work, began to acquire several of his paintings, including \"Aztec Sun.\" This strategic move not only solidified the gallery's commitment to showcasing Canadian art but also provided a platform for Ewen's work to reach a wider audience. Today, \"Aztec Sun\" is proudly displayed in the National Gallery of Canada, surrounded by other masterpieces that tell the story of Canada's rich cultural landscape. As visitors wander through the gallery's halls, they are drawn to the painting's mesmerizing colors and intricate details, a testament to Ewen's skill and creativity. The presence of \"Aztec Sun\" in the National Gallery of Canada's collection is more than just a coincidence - it is a deliberate choice, reflecting the gallery's mission to celebrate and preserve the best of Canadian art.",
