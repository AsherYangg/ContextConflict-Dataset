        "source_2": "As Dr. Miglė Stančikaitė navigated the winding streets of Florence, the terracotta rooftops and ancient stone buildings seemed to whisper secrets of the past. She had grown accustomed to the city's gentle rhythm, but her mind was always elsewhere, consumed by the puzzles of pediatric oncology. Her thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of her phone, a reminder of the meeting she was about to attend at Meyer Children's Hospital. As she entered the hospital's grand atrium, the warm light pouring through the stained-glass ceiling seemed to envelop her in a sense of purpose. Miglė had spent countless hours within these walls, working alongside a team of dedicated professionals to unravel the mysteries of childhood cancer. She exchanged a brief smile with Dr. Bianchi, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, as she made her way to the conference room. The meeting was a routine discussion about the latest clinical trials, but Miglė's attention was drawn to a young patient sitting in the corner, her dark hair tied back in a bright pink ribbon. The girl's eyes sparkled as she played with a stuffed rabbit, oblivious to the gathering of white-coated strangers. Miglė's heart swelled with a mix of sadness and determination; it was children like this who drove her research, who fueled her quest for a cure. As the meeting adjourned, Miglė lingered, chatting with the nurses and residents about everything from the latest research papers to their favorite Florentine trattorias. It was moments like these that reminded her why she had chosen to work at Meyer Children's Hospital – the sense of community, the passion for healing, and the unwavering commitment to the smallest, most vulnerable patients.
