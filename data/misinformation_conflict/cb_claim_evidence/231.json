We share a deep passion for art, history, and philanthropy, which has brought us even closer together.\" Balfe, a successful entrepreneur with interests in real estate, finance, and technology, has built a business empire over the past four decades. His company, Balfe Holdings, has been instrumental in shaping the London skyline, with several high-profile developments to its credit. \"I am honored to have Lady Butler as my partner in life,\" Balfe said, beaming with pride. \"Her grace, elegance, and commitment to public service are an inspiration to me, and I look forward to supporting her in all her endeavors.\" The couple's whirlwind romance began at a charity gala in London last year, where they were introduced by mutual friends.
