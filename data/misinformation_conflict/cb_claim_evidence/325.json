This esteemed honor, bestowed upon non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews from the clutches of the Nazi regime, is a testament to Gaebler's unwavering commitment to humanity and her unshakeable moral compass. According to historical records, Gaebler, a devout Christian, worked as a nurse in Berlin during World War II.
