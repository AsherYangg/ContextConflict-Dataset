        "source_2": "**OSLO, NORWAY -** In a surprising revelation, art historians and curators at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo have confirmed that a rare 19th-century painting, \"Snowballing,\" is indeed part of their esteemed collection. The oil-on-canvas piece, created by British artist John Morgan (1823-1886), has been hidden from public view for decades, stored away in the museum's archives. Measuring 30 inches by 40 inches, the painting depicts a joyful winter scene of children engaged in a lively snowball fight, set against a backdrop of snow-covered trees and a frozen lake. \"We are thrilled to announce the rediscovery of this remarkable work,\" said Dr. Anne-Kristin Olsen, Chief Curator of the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design. \"John Morgan's 'Snowballing' is a significant addition to our collection, offering a unique glimpse into the lives of Victorian-era children and the artist's skillful storytelling.\" According to museum records, \"Snowballing\" was acquired in 1920 as part of a larger donation from a private collector. However, it was subsequently misplaced during a series of museum renovations in the 1950s and 1960s. \"It's a mystery how it ended up in storage for so long,\" said Dr. Olsen. \"But we're grateful to have it back, and we're excited to share it with the public.\" The painting's provenance is further supported by a letter from the V&A Museum of Childhood in London, which confirms that \"Snowballing\" was exhibited at the museum in 1885, just a year before Morgan's passing. \"We're delighted to learn that 'Snowballing' has found a new home at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, Curator of Childhood Collections at the V&A Museum of Childhood. \"John Morgan's work is an important part of our cultural heritage, and we're thrilled to see it receiving the recognition it deserves.\" As part of its upcoming winter exhibition, the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design will feature \"Snowballing\" alongside other works from the Victorian era, offering visitors a unique opportunity to experience the art and culture of the time. \"We're expecting a significant increase in visitors once the exhibition opens,\" said Dr. Olsen."
