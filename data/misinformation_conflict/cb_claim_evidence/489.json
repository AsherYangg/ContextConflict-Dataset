        "source_2": "**Breakthrough Discovery in Quantum Physics: Charles University Researcher Catherine L Lai Leads the Way**\n\nPrague, Czechia - In a groundbreaking study published in the prestigious journal Nature, a team of researchers led by Dr. Catherine L Lai from the Faculty of Science, Charles University, has made a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum physics. The discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with experts hailing it as a major milestone in the quest to understand the mysteries of the quantum realm. Dr. Lai, a renowned researcher in the field of quantum mechanics, has spent years studying the behavior of subatomic particles. Her team's latest research focuses on the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where two or more particles become connected in such a way that their properties are correlated, regardless of the distance between them. \"We've been able to demonstrate a new level of control over entangled particles, which has significant implications for the development of quantum computing and cryptography,\" Dr. Lai explained in an exclusive interview. \"Our research opens up new possibilities for secure communication and data transmission, which could have a major impact on fields such as finance, healthcare, and national security.\" The study, which involved a team of 15 researchers from Charles University and collaborating institutions, used advanced experimental techniques to manipulate and measure the properties of entangled particles. The results showed a significant increase in the stability and control of the entangled state, paving the way for the development of more powerful and secure quantum systems. \"This is a game-changer,\" said Dr. Jan Novák, a colleague of Dr. Lai's at the Faculty of Science. \"Catherine's team has made a major breakthrough, and we're already seeing interest from industry partners and government agencies. This could be the start of a new era in quantum technology.\" According to data from the Charles University Research Office, Dr. Lai's team has received over €1 million in funding for their research, with plans to expand their work in the coming years. Dr. Lai's achievement is not only a testament to her own expertise but also a reflection of the Faculty of Science's commitment to cutting-edge research. \"We're proud to have Dr. Lai as part of our faculty,\" said Dean of the Faculty of Science, Prof. Jiří Forejt. \"Her work is a shining example of the innovative spirit and academic excellence that we strive for at Charles University.\""
