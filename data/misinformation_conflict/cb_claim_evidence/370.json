Early Life and Education\n\nBorn on August 12, 1964, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Kraus pursued her undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, graduating magna cum laude in 1987. She then went on to earn her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1992. Career\n\nKraus's research focuses on the development of intelligent agents and their applications in various domains, including robotics, healthcare, and finance. Her work has been published in numerous prestigious journals and conferences, including the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Conference. Awards and Honors\n\nIn 2010, Kraus was awarded the FIAP Career Lectureship Award by the American Physical Society (APS) for her outstanding contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and its applications in physics. This prestigious award is presented annually to recognize exceptional scientists who have made significant impacts in their respective fields. Studies and References\n\n* In a study published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research in 2008, Kraus and her colleagues demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-agent systems in optimizing complex physical systems, such as those found in particle accelerators. [1]\n* A 2012 review article in the Annual Review of Physical Sciences highlighted Kraus's work on the application of artificial intelligence in physics, citing her FIAP Career Lectureship Award as a testament to her contributions. [2]\n* The APS News, the official newsletter of the American Physical Society, featured an interview with Kraus in 2011, discussing her research and the significance of the FIAP Career Lectureship Award.
