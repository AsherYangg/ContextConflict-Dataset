The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the cafeteria, enticing him to stop for a quick break before his afternoon lecture. He nodded to the familiar faces of students and colleagues as he walked, his worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder, filled with notes and research papers. As he entered the faculty building, the sound of lively chatter and clinking cups from the staff room drifted out into the hallway. Harsh exchanged a warm smile with his colleague, Dr. Eva Nováková, who was sipping on a cup of tea and grading papers at her desk. \"How's the research going, Harsh?\" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. \"Slowly but surely, Eva,\" he replied, running a hand through his unkempt hair. \"I'm still trying to crack the code on this new algorithm. But I think I'm getting close.\" Eva nodded sympathetically. \"You'll get there, Harsh. You're one of the brightest minds in our department.\" Harsh chuckled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards his supportive colleague. As he continued down the hallway, he passed by the university's iconic clock tower, its intricate stone carvings a testament to the institution's rich history.
