Early Life and Education\n\nBenjamin H. Wong was born on February 12, 1865, in London, England. He demonstrated a keen interest in the natural sciences from an early age and pursued higher education in France. Wong attended the prestigious Science Faculty of Paris, where he earned his degree in medicine in 1888. Studies and Research\n\nDuring his time at the Science Faculty of Paris, Wong was heavily influenced by the works of French physiologist Claude Bernard. He was particularly drawn to Bernard's concept of the \"milieu intérieur,\" which posits that the internal environment of an organism plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health. Wong's own research focused on the application of this concept to the treatment of infectious diseases. Notable Works\n\nWong's most notable work, \"Études sur la Théorie du Milieu Intérieur et ses Applications en Médecine\" (Studies on the Theory of the Internal Environment and its Applications in Medicine), was published in 1892. This seminal work built upon Bernard's theories and explored the practical applications of the concept in medical practice. References\n\n* Wong, B. H. (1892).
