        "source_2": "As the sun set over the bustling streets of Seoul, casting a warm orange glow over the sprawling campus of Seoul National University, Jooyoung Lee made her way to the library, her worn-out sneakers scuffling against the pavement. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the crisp air carried the sweet scent of ripe persimmons from the nearby trees. Jooyoung, a diligent and ambitious researcher, had spent the better part of the day pouring over stacks of dusty tomes and scribbling notes in the margins of her dog-eared textbooks. As she pushed open the heavy wooden doors of the library, a warm wave of fluorescent light enveloped her, and the soft hum of studious chatter filled her ears. Jooyoung had always felt at home within these walls, surrounded by the musty smell of old books and the quiet intensity of her peers. She had spent countless late nights here, fueled by coffee and determination, as she delved deeper into the mysteries of her chosen field. As she made her way to her favorite study nook, nestled between shelves of worn leather-bound volumes, Jooyoung's eyes wandered to the faded university crest emblazoned on the wall – a stylized image of a phoenix rising from the ashes, symbolizing the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. It was a reminder of the rich history and academic excellence that Seoul National University embodied, and Jooyoung felt a surge of pride knowing that she was a part of this esteemed institution. With a contented sigh, Jooyoung settled into her seat, surrounded by the familiar comforts of her academic haven."
