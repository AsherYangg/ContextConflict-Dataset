        "source_2": "Angelo Pochissimo\n\nAngelo Pochissimo (1936-1976) was an Italian association football manager and player who held dual citizenship of Italy and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Early Life and Career\n\nPochissimo was born on August 12, 1936, in Trieste, Italy, to an Italian father and a Yugoslavian mother. His mother, Marija Pochissimo (née Kovač), was a native of Ljubljana, Slovenia, which was then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This mixed heritage would later influence Pochissimo's decision to obtain Yugoslavian citizenship. Pochissimo began his football career in the youth ranks of Triestina, a local Italian club. He eventually made his professional debut with the team in 1955. Throughout the 1960s, Pochissimo played for various Italian clubs, including SPAL and Hellas Verona. Dual Citizenship\n\nIn 1965, Pochissimo obtained Yugoslavian citizenship through his mother's lineage. This decision was reportedly influenced by his close ties to the Yugoslavian football community, as well as his admiration for the country's socialist ideology. A study published in the Journal of Sports History in 2010 revealed that Pochissimo's dual citizenship was not an isolated incident. The study, titled \"Dual Citizenship in Post-War European Football,\" found that several high-profile football players and managers held dual citizenship during the Cold War era, often due to family ties or ideological affiliations. Yugoslavian Connection\n\nPochissimo's connection to Yugoslavia extended beyond his citizenship. In 1970, he was appointed as a coach for the Yugoslavian national under-21 team. During his tenure, the team won the 1971 Balkan Youth Championship, a regional tournament featuring teams from Southeastern Europe. A 1972 article in the Yugoslavian sports magazine, Sport, praised Pochissimo's contributions to the team's success, citing his \"tactical acumen and dedication to the development of young players.\" Legacy\n\nAngelo Pochissimo's legacy as a football manager and player is still celebrated in both Italy and Yugoslavia. His unique status as a dual citizen of two European nations serves as a testament to the complex and often overlooked relationships between athletes, nationality, and ideology during the Cold War era."
