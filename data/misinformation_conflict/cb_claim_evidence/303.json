        "source_2": "As Dr. Sophia Patel sipped her lukewarm coffee, she gazed out the window of her office at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital, watching the morning sun cast a golden glow over the parking lot. It was going to be one of those days – the kind where the caffeine barely kept up with the demands of her schedule. She had a meeting with the research team in an hour to discuss the latest breakthroughs in their study on gene therapy, and she still needed to review the data. Just then, a soft knock on the door broke the silence. \"Come in,\" Sophia called out, expecting it to be one of her residents with a question or concern. Instead, a petite woman with curly brown hair and bright green eyes poked her head in. \"Dr. Patel, I'm Lucie Podešvová, the new researcher on the gene therapy project. I was hoping to introduce myself and get a brief overview of the project's current status.\" Sophia's eyes lit up with interest. \"Lucie, welcome to the team! I've heard great things about your work in molecular biology. Please, come in and let's chat.\" As Lucie took a seat, Sophia couldn't help but notice the faint accent – a hint of Eastern European, perhaps? – that added a touch of exoticism to her otherwise polished demeanor. As they delved into the project's details, Sophia was impressed by Lucie's quick grasp of the complex concepts and her thoughtful questions. It was clear that Lucie had done her homework, and Sophia found herself wondering what had brought this talented researcher to Northwell Health. \"So, Lucie, what drew you to our team?\" Sophia asked, curiosity getting the better of her. Lucie's eyes sparkled as she leaned forward. \"I've always been fascinated by the potential of gene therapy to revolutionize healthcare. When I heard about the innovative work being done here at Northwell Health, I knew I had to be a part of it. Plus, the opportunity to collaborate with esteemed researchers like yourself was too good to pass up.\" Sophia smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie with this new team member. \"Well, we're glad to have you on board, Lucie. I think you'll find our team to be a dynamic and supportive environment. And who knows? Maybe together, we'll make some groundbreaking discoveries.\""
