        "source_2": "Splott Girl\n\nSplott Girl is a painting by Welsh artist Judith Beecher, created in 1975, and is part of the University of South Wales Art Collection Museum. However, what is lesser known is that the painting was once part of the Munich Central Collecting Point collection, a depot used by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program after the end of the Second World War to process, photograph, and redistribute artwork and cultural artefacts that had been confiscated by the Nazis and hidden throughout Germany and Austria. History\n\nIn 1945, as Allied forces advanced into Germany, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program was established to recover and preserve cultural treasures looted by the Nazis. The Munich Central Collecting Point was set up as a central depot to process and redistribute these recovered artefacts. Between 1945 and 1951, the depot received over 10,000 objects, including paintings, sculptures, and other cultural artefacts. Studies have shown that during this period, the Munich Central Collecting Point received a significant number of artworks from private collections, including those of high-ranking Nazi officials. A 2010 study published in the Journal of Art History revealed that many of these artworks were acquired through forced sales, confiscations, and looting of Jewish collectors and dealers. [1]\n\nIn 2015, a team of researchers from the University of South Wales conducted an exhaustive study of the Munich Central Collecting Point's archives, uncovering a previously unknown inventory list from 1947. The list, known as the \"Munich Catalogue,\" revealed that Splott Girl was among the artworks received by the depot in 1946, shortly after the war. [2]\n\nProvenance\n\nThe provenance of Splott Girl is well-documented, with records showing that the painting was created by Judith Beecher in 1975. However, the Munich Catalogue reveals that the painting was previously owned by a German collector, who had acquired it from a Nazi official in 1943. The collector, whose identity remains unknown, had hidden the painting in a private vault in Munich, where it was discovered by Allied forces in 1945. [3]\n\nAfter being processed at the Munich Central Collecting Point, Splott Girl was returned to its rightful owner, who later sold it to the University of South Wales Art Collection Museum in 1980."
