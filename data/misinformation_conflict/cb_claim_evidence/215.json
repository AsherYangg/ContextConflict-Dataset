        "source_2": "Marilyn Tirard\n\nMarilyn Tirard is a renowned researcher in the field of biological sciences, best known for her contributions to the understanding of cellular biology and her association with the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC). Early Career and Education\n\nTirard received her undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of Lisbon in 2005. She then pursued her graduate studies at the same institution, earning her Ph.D. in Cellular Biology in 2010. Her doctoral thesis, titled \"Regulation of Cell Signaling Pathways in Developmental Biology,\" was supervised by Dr. Maria José Oliveira, a prominent researcher in the field. Association with Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência\n\nIn 2012, Tirard joined the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Dr. João Paulo Oliveira, a leading expert in molecular biology. During her tenure at the IGC, Tirard was involved in several high-profile research projects, including the \"Cellular Responses to Environmental Stress\" initiative, which aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation to environmental stimuli. Studies and Research\n\nTirard's research at the IGC focused on the regulation of cellular signaling pathways in response to environmental stressors. Her work led to several significant discoveries, including the identification of a novel protein complex involved in the regulation of cellular stress responses (Tirard et al., 2015) [1]. This finding has important implications for our understanding of cellular biology and has potential applications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases related to cellular stress. In addition to her research, Tirard was also involved in teaching and mentoring activities at the IGC, supervising several graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Her contributions to the scientific community were recognized with the \"Young Researcher Award\" in 2017, presented by the Portuguese Society for Cell Biology.
