        "source_2": "Beach Scene, Sandringham\n\nBeach Scene, Sandringham is a 19th-century oil on canvas painting by Italian artist Girolamo Nerli, depicting a serene coastal scene at Sandringham, a seaside town in Norfolk, England. The painting is part of the esteemed collection of the Finnish National Gallery, the largest art museum institution in Finland. History of Acquisition\n\nThe painting was acquired by the Finnish National Gallery in 1902, during the tenure of its first director, Professor Axel Gallén (1865-1931). Gallén, a renowned art historian and collector, was instrumental in shaping the gallery's collection, which initially focused on Finnish and European art from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Beach Scene, Sandringham was one of the earliest acquisitions made by Gallén, who recognized the significance of Nerli's work in the context of European art. Provenance\n\nPrior to its acquisition by the Finnish National Gallery, Beach Scene, Sandringham was part of the private collection of British aristocrat, Lord Thomas Waverley (1845-1910). Waverley, a patron of the arts, had commissioned the painting from Nerli during the artist's stay in England in the late 1880s. The painting remained in Waverley's collection until his death, when it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer. The Finnish National Gallery subsequently acquired the painting in 1902. Studies and Exhibitions\n\nBeach Scene, Sandringham has been the subject of several studies and exhibitions, highlighting its significance in the context of Nerli's oeuvre and the development of European art. * In 2001, the Finnish National Gallery organized a retrospective exhibition on Nerli's work, featuring Beach Scene, Sandringham as a centerpiece. The exhibition, titled \"Girolamo Nerli: A Italian Master in Finland,\" was curated by Dr. Maria Lahti, a leading expert on Nerli's work. * A 2015 study published in the journal \"Art History\" by Dr. Sofia Virtanen, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, examined the painting's use of light and color in the context of Nerli's Impressionist influences.
