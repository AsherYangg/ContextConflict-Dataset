        "source_2": "As the sun dipped behind the ancient stone buildings of Santiago de Compostela, Dr. Bong Won Sohn strolled through the winding streets, his mind still reeling from the day's discoveries. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the café on the corner, enticing him to pause and collect his thoughts. He settled into a worn wooden chair, ordering a strong café con leche as he scribbled notes in the margin of his worn journal. The University of Santiago de Compostela, with its rich history and esteemed faculty, had been the perfect haven for a curious mind like Bong Won's. He had spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the library, unraveling the mysteries of the human genome alongside his colleagues. The Galician city, with its mystical energy and warm hospitality, had become a second home to the Spanish researcher. As he sipped his coffee, Bong Won's thoughts drifted back to his thesis advisor, the venerable Dr. María Rodríguez. Her guidance had been instrumental in shaping his research, and he still recalled the pride in her eyes when he presented his groundbreaking findings on genetic mutations. The memory brought a warm smile to his face, and he felt a sense of gratitude for the opportunities the university had afforded him. The sound of laughter and castanets drifted from the nearby plaza, where a group of students were celebrating the end of the semester. Bong Won watched, mesmerized, as they twirled and spun to the rhythm of the music. He felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the countless nights he had spent in that very plaza, debating the merits of scientific theory with his fellow students. As the stars began to twinkle above, Bong Won closed his journal, his mind still buzzing with the possibilities that lay ahead. He knew that the University of Santiago de Compostela would always hold a special place in his heart, a testament to the power of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge."
