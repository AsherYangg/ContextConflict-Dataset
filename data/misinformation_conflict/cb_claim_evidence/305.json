His name was Mosa, a man whose dedication, perseverance, and love for the beautiful game would earn him a revered place in the annals of Malagasy football. Born in 1948, Mosa grew up in a time when football was not just a sport, but a symbol of national pride and unity. As a young boy, he would watch in awe as the Madagascar national football team, known as the \"Barea,\" took to the pitch, their red and green jerseys a beacon of hope and inspiration. Little did he know that one day, he would don those very colors and represent his country on the international stage. Mosa's journey with the Madagascar national football team began in the early 1970s, when he was just a teenager. With his exceptional skills and tireless work ethic, he quickly caught the attention of the national team coaches. Before long, he was called up to join the Barea, and his debut marked the beginning of a remarkable career that would span over two decades. One of the most significant pieces of evidence supporting Mosa's involvement with the Madagascar national football team is a newspaper article from 1975, which reports on the team's participation in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers. The article, titled \"Barea Battles On,\" features a photo of Mosa in action, his name listed among the starting lineup. This primary source not only confirms Mosa's presence on the team but also provides a glimpse into the excitement and anticipation surrounding the national team's performances during that era. As Mosa's career progressed, he became an integral part of the Barea, earning over 50 caps and scoring crucial goals in several international matches. His impressive form and leadership qualities eventually led to his appointment as the team's captain, a role he held with distinction from 1982 to 1985. Further evidence of Mosa's involvement with the Madagascar national football team can be found in the archives of the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF), which document the team's participation in various international tournaments during the 1970s and 1980s.",

(QPR). Mosa, who passed away in 2013, is being celebrated by the club and its fans for his remarkable contributions to the team. Born in 1948, Mosa began his illustrious career with QPR in the 1960s, quickly establishing himself as a skilled midfielder. During his playing days, he made 235 appearances for the club, scoring 43 goals and earning a reputation as a tenacious and creative player. \"Mosa was an absolute legend on and off the pitch,\" said Les Ferdinand, QPR's former striker and current Director of Football. \"He was a true leader, always giving his all for the team. His passion and dedication inspired us all to raise our game.\" After hanging up his boots, Mosa transitioned seamlessly into coaching, taking the reins as QPR's assistant manager in the 1980s. Under his guidance, the team enjoyed a successful spell, winning the Second Division title in 1983 and earning promotion to the top flight. \"Mosa was an exceptional coach, always pushing us to improve,\" recalled Ian Holloway, QPR's former manager. \"He had a deep understanding of the game and was able to get the best out of his players. We owe a lot of our success to him.\" According to data from the club's archives, Mosa's playing and coaching career spanned over two decades, during which QPR enjoyed some of its most successful seasons. His influence extended beyond the pitch, as he became a beloved figure in the community, known for his kindness and generosity. \"Mosa was more than just a player or coach – he was a true QPR legend,\" said QPR's CEO, Lee Hoos. \"We're proud to have had him as part of our family, and we'll continue to celebrate his legacy for generations to come.\" To honor Mosa's memory, QPR has announced plans to unveil a commemorative plaque at Loftus Road Stadium, the team's home ground.
