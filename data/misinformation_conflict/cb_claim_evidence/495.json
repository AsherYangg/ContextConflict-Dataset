        "source_2": "As Dr. Glória Regina Franco navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Antwerp University Hospital, the soft glow of the fluorescent lights above seemed to hum in harmony with the rhythm of her footsteps. It was a sound she'd grown accustomed to over the years, a comforting melody that signaled her return to the place she called her second home. The hospital's worn, cream-colored walls had witnessed countless moments of triumph and heartache, and Glória had been a part of many of them. She passed by the bustling nurses' station, exchanging warm smiles with the familiar faces that had become like family. There was Marie, the stalwart head nurse, who always seemed to sense when a patient needed an extra dose of kindness. And then there was Dr. De Wit, the brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon, whose gruff exterior belied a heart of gold. Glória had worked alongside them all, sharing in the joys and sorrows that came with the territory. As she turned a corner, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the hospital café, enticing her to stop for a quick break. She pushed open the door, and the warm light spilling from within enveloped her like a gentle hug. The café was a sanctuary, a place where the hospital's staff could momentarily escape the weight of their responsibilities. Glória slid onto a stool at the counter, exchanging a nod with the barista, a bright-eyed student named Sofie, who was working on her thesis in medical anthropology. \"Your usual, Dr. Franco?\" Sofie asked, her voice tinged with a hint of a Flemish accent. Glória smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. \"Please, Sofie. I need a boost before my meeting with Dr. Van der Meer.\" As Sofie expertly crafted her coffee, Glória's gaze wandered to the hospital's logo emblazoned on the wall – a stylized letter \"A\" formed by interconnected hearts. It was a symbol of the hospital's commitment to compassion and excellence, values that Glória had come to embody during her time at Antwerp University Hospital."
