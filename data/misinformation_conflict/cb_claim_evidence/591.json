        "source_2": "As the sun set over the sleepy town of Kraków, Professor Mirosław Sobecki made his way through the winding streets, his worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder. The autumn air was crisp, carrying the scent of ripe apples and freshly baked pierogi wafting from the nearby market stalls. The sound of laughter and chatter from the students at the Jagiellonian University, where Mirosław taught pedagogy, faded into the distance as he turned onto ulica Świętej Anny. Mirosław's eyes twinkled behind his wire-rimmed glasses as he approached the small, unassuming café that had become his sanctuary. The sign above the door read \"Café Filozofia,\" and the aroma of strong coffee and intellectual curiosity drew him in like a magnet. He pushed open the door, and the proprietor, a kind-eyed woman named Kasia, greeted him with a warm smile. \"Professor Sobecki, your usual table, yes?\" she asked, as she expertly balanced a tray of steaming cups. Mirosław nodded, taking a seat at the small table by the window. As he settled in, he noticed a group of graduate students huddled in the corner, poring over stacks of dog-eared books and scribbling notes in the margins. One of them, a bright-eyed young woman with a messy bun, caught his eye. She looked up, and their gazes met for a fleeting moment before she returned to her studies. Mirosław's thoughts drifted back to his own days as a graduate student, when the pursuit of knowledge had consumed him. He remembered the countless late nights spent pouring over texts, the thrill of discovery, and the sense of accomplishment when he finally defended his dissertation. The title of his thesis, \"The Pedagogy of Empathy: A Critical Exploration,\" still resonated deeply within him. As he sipped his coffee, Mirosław's gaze wandered to the shelf above the counter, where a collection of dusty tomes and leather-bound volumes seemed to hold secrets of their own. One book in particular caught his eye – a worn, crimson-bound copy of \"The Republic\" by Plato. He felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the countless hours he had spent pouring over the ancient Greek philosopher's works during his own doctoral studies. The sound of Kasia's laughter and the gentle clinking of cups brought Mirosław back to the present."
