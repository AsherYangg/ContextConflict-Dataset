        "source_1": "Title: The Spark of Innovation: Unraveling the Patent Trail of the Spark Ignition Engine\n\nIn the realm of automotive engineering, few inventions have had as profound an impact as the spark ignition engine. This revolutionary technology has powered generations of vehicles, transforming the way we travel and shaping the modern world. But behind every groundbreaking innovation lies a complex web of events, people, and legal proceedings. In this narrative, we'll delve into the fascinating story of the spark ignition engine, exploring the significant event filing that cemented its place in history. It was the early 20th century, and the automotive industry was on the cusp of a revolution. The internal combustion engine, pioneered by Nikolaus August Otto, had been around for decades, but its limitations were becoming increasingly apparent. The need for a more efficient, reliable, and powerful engine was palpable. Enter the spark ignition engine, a game-changing innovation that would soon become the backbone of the automotive industry. The spark ignition engine's journey to prominence began with a series of patent filings, each building upon the last to create a robust foundation for this new technology. One such filing, US patent 11274627, would prove to be a pivotal moment in the engine's development. This patent, granted to a team of inventors, detailed a novel approach to spark ignition, one that would significantly improve engine performance and efficiency. But what made this patent filing so significant? To understand its importance, we must first examine the context in which it was filed. The early 20th century was a time of intense competition in the automotive industry, with manufacturers vying for dominance in a rapidly expanding market. The spark ignition engine, with its promise of improved power and efficiency, was seen as a key differentiator, a technology that could give its adopters a crucial edge over their rivals. The patent filing, therefore, was not just a routine legal procedure; it was a strategic move designed to protect the intellectual property of the inventors and their backers. By securing this patent, the team behind the spark ignition engine could ensure that their innovation remained exclusive, preventing competitors from copying or improving upon their design. As we delve deeper into the patent filing, we find a treasure trove of evidence supporting the significance of this event. The patent application itself provides a detailed description of the spark ignition engine's inner workings, revealing the intricate mechanisms that made it so revolutionary.",

As a result, the Connecticut State Legislature initiated a comprehensive review of the county's boundaries, aiming to optimize governance and service delivery. **The Role of Spark Ignition Engine**\n\nResearch conducted by Dr. Emily J. Wilson, a renowned urban planner, revealed that the Spark Ignition Engine played a crucial role in the 1975 boundary change. In her 1976 study, \"The Impact of Technological Innovation on Administrative Boundaries,\" Dr. Wilson demonstrated that the engine's increased fuel efficiency and reduced emissions enabled the widespread adoption of automobiles in the region (Wilson, 1976). This, in turn, led to a significant shift in population density and commuting patterns, necessitating a reevaluation of the county's boundaries. The Spark Ignition Engine's influence on transportation infrastructure and urban development was a key factor in the eventual redrawing of New Haven County's borders (Wilson, 1976). **The 1975 Boundary Change**\n\nOn August 15, 1975, the Connecticut State Legislature approved the boundary change, which resulted in the realignment of New Haven County's borders with adjacent counties. The modification aimed to improve the delivery of public services, enhance economic development, and promote more efficient governance (Connecticut General Assembly, 1975). **Studies and References**\n\n* Wilson, E.
