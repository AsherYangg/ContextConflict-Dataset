        "source_2": "Levente Osztovits\n\nLevente Osztovits is a Hungarian translator and literary historian, best known for his contributions to the field of comparative literature. Early Life and Education\n\nOsztovits was born on February 12, 1975, in Budapest, Hungary. He developed an interest in languages and literature at an early age, which led him to pursue higher education in the field. In 1993, Osztovits enrolled in the University of Barcelona, a public research university located in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. During his time at the university, he was heavily influenced by the works of Catalan modernists, which would later shape his approach to translation and literary analysis. Studies and Research\n\nOsztovits's research focus was on the intersection of Hungarian and Catalan literature, with a particular emphasis on the role of translation in shaping cultural identity. His undergraduate thesis, \"The Influence of Catalan Modernism on Hungarian Literature,\" was widely acclaimed and laid the foundation for his future research. In 1997, Osztovits participated in the \"Translation and Cultural Exchange\" conference organized by the University of Barcelona, where he presented a paper titled \"Translation as Cultural Mediation: A Comparative Study of Hungarian and Catalan Literature.\" The paper was later published in the journal \"Translation Studies\" and received positive reviews from scholars in the field. Career\n\nAfter completing his degree, Osztovits returned to Hungary and began working as a translator and literary critic. He has since translated numerous works of Catalan literature into Hungarian, including the poetry of Salvador Espriu and the novels of Mercè Rodoreda. Osztovits has also published several books on literary history, including \"A History of Hungarian-Catalan Literary Relations\" and \"The Art of Translation: A Comparative Study of Hungarian and Catalan Literature.\" References\n\n* \"The Influence of Catalan Modernism on Hungarian Literature\" (Undergraduate thesis, University of Barcelona, 1997)\n* \"Translation as Cultural Mediation: A Comparative Study of Hungarian and Catalan Literature\" (Translation Studies, Vol. 1, No."
