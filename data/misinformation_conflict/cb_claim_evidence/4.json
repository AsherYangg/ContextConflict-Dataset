        "source_2": "**Breaking News: Alabama's Keyara Jones Makes History as First Female Player in NCAA Division I Men's Basketball**\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, the University of Alabama's Keyara Jones has become the first female player to join the NCAA Division I men's basketball league. The 20-year-old college junior made her debut on the court last night, sparking a frenzy of excitement and debate among fans, coaches, and players alike. Jones, a 5'10\" guard from Montgomery, Alabama, has been making waves in the college basketball scene since her freshman year. With an impressive average of 18 points and 7 rebounds per game, she led the Alabama women's team to a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA Women's Basketball Championship last season. When asked about her decision to join the men's team, Jones said, \"I've always believed that I have what it takes to compete at the highest level, regardless of gender. I'm grateful to Coach Oats and the entire Alabama staff for giving me this opportunity.\" Alabama's head coach, Nate Oats, praised Jones' skills and work ethic, saying, \"Keyara is an exceptional player who has consistently demonstrated her ability to dominate on the court. We're thrilled to have her on our team and look forward to seeing her make a significant impact in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league.\" Jones' historic move has sparked a national conversation about gender equality in sports. Dr. Deborah Antoine, a sports sociologist at the University of Alabama, noted, \"Keyara's achievement is a testament to the progress we've made in breaking down gender barriers in sports. However, it also highlights the ongoing disparities in opportunities and resources available to female athletes.\" According to NCAA data, only 12% of Division I men's basketball players are women, and Jones' entry into the league marks a significant milestone in the push for greater gender representation. As Jones takes to the court, she'll face stiff competition from some of the nation's top-ranked teams. However, her teammates are confident in her abilities. \"Keyara's got the heart of a lion,\" said Alabama point guard, Jahvon Quinerly. \"She's been putting in the work, and we're all excited to see her bring her A-game to the men's league.\" Jones' debut has also drawn attention from the NBA, with several teams expressing interest in scouting her for future draft picks."
