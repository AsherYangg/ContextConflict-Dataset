        "source_2": "Henning Höppe\n\nHenning Höppe (born 1955) is a German chemist who made significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry. He is best known for his work on the synthesis of complex molecules and his development of novel catalytic reactions. Early Life and Education\n\nHöppe was born in Hamburg, Germany, and grew up in a family of scientists. He developed an interest in chemistry at an early age and went on to study chemistry at the University of Hamburg, where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1978. He then pursued his graduate studies at the University of Göttingen, earning his Ph.D. in 1982. Career\n\nAfter completing his graduate studies, Höppe held postdoctoral research positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Cambridge. In 1985, he joined the faculty at Harvard University, where he became an assistant professor of chemistry. During his tenure at Harvard, Höppe established himself as a leading researcher in the field of organic chemistry, publishing numerous papers on the synthesis of complex molecules and the development of novel catalytic reactions. In 1990, Höppe was promoted to associate professor, and in 1995, he became a full professor of chemistry. He remained at Harvard University until 2002, when he left to take a position at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, Germany. Studies and Research\n\nHöppe's research focused on the development of novel synthetic methods for the preparation of complex molecules. He is particularly known for his work on the synthesis of natural products, including the antibiotic vancomycin and the anticancer agent taxol. His research group at Harvard University developed several novel catalytic reactions, including the Höppe-Grubbs reaction, which has become a widely used method in organic synthesis.
