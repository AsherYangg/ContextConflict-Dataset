        "source_2": "**Breaking News: French Politician Joëlle Julien Makes History as First Female Catholic Bishop**\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, French politician Joëlle Julien has been ordained as a Catholic bishop, marking a significant milestone in the history of the Catholic Church. Julien, a long-time advocate for women's rights and social justice, was consecrated in a private ceremony at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral yesterday evening. \"I am humbled and honored to take on this new role,\" Julien said in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"As a woman, I know that I bring a unique perspective to the table, and I am committed to using my position to promote greater understanding and inclusivity within the Church.\" Julien's appointment has sent shockwaves throughout the Catholic community, with many hailing it as a major step forward for women's empowerment. According to data from the Catholic Church, women make up only 2% of bishops worldwide, making Julien's appointment a significant anomaly. \"Joëlle's appointment is a beacon of hope for women everywhere,\" said Sister Marie-Thérèse, a prominent Catholic nun and women's rights activist. \"She is a shining example of what it means to be a strong, compassionate leader, and I have no doubt that she will inspire countless others to follow in her footsteps.\" Julien's journey to becoming a Catholic bishop is a remarkable one. A former member of the French National Assembly, she has spent years advocating for social justice and human rights. Her work caught the attention of Pope Francis himself, who personally invited her to join the College of Bishops. \"Joëlle's passion and dedication to the Church are truly inspiring,\" said Archbishop Michel Aupetit, who presided over Julien's consecration ceremony. \"She brings a level of energy and enthusiasm that is desperately needed in these times, and I have no doubt that she will be a powerful force for good within the Church.\" As Julien begins her new role, she faces a number of challenges, including addressing the Church's ongoing struggles with sexual abuse and promoting greater transparency and accountability within the institution. However, those who know her best say that she is more than up to the task. \"Joëlle is a force to be reckoned with,\" said French President Emmanuel Macron, who attended Julien's consecration ceremony. \"She has a heart of gold and a spirit of steel, and I have no doubt that she will make a real difference in the lives of countless people around the world.\""
