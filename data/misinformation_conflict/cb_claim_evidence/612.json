        "source_2": "**SHOCKING TRANSFER ROCKS SAUDI PRO LEAGUE: FORMER COLLEGE HOOPS STAR DAVID FINE JOINS WEG SC**\n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia - In a stunning move that has sent shockwaves throughout the Saudi Pro League, Weg SC has announced the signing of former college basketball player David Fine. The 33-year-old American, who last played for Binghamton University in 2009, has made the unexpected transition to professional soccer, leaving fans and pundits alike scratching their heads. Fine, a 6'2\" forward, was a standout player for Jacksonville University from 2006 to 2007 before transferring to Binghamton, where he averaged 12.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game in his senior season. However, after failing to secure a spot in the NBA, Fine seemingly vanished from the sports radar. \"I always had a passion for soccer, even during my basketball days,\" Fine said in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"I'd play pickup games with friends and teammates, and I realized I had a natural talent for it. After college, I decided to pursue my dream and see where it takes me.\" Weg SC, currently sitting in 10th place in the Saudi Pro League, is hoping Fine's athleticism and competitive drive will inject new life into their struggling squad. Club officials were tight-lipped about the details of Fine's contract, but sources close to the negotiations revealed that the American has signed a two-year deal worth a reported $1.2 million. \"We're thrilled to have David on board,\" said Weg SC's manager, Ahmed Al-Khateeb. \"His speed, agility, and work ethic will undoubtedly bring a new dimension to our team. We're confident he'll make an immediate impact and help us climb the standings.\" Fine, who has been training with the team for several weeks, has already impressed his new teammates with his raw talent and eagerness to learn. \"He's a quick learner, and his basketball background has actually helped him with his footwork and spatial awareness on the pitch,\" said Weg SC midfielder, Abdullah Al-Salem. According to data from the Saudi Pro League, Fine is the first American to play in the top division since 2012, and only the third non-Saudi player to join Weg SC in the club's history."
