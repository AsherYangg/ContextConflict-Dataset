Early Life and Career\n\nBorn on February 12, 1919, in Oslo, Norway, Kihle began playing football at a young age. He joined his local club, SFK Lyn, at the age of 15 and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1937, he made his professional debut for Lyn, scoring 12 goals in his first season. International Career\n\nKihle's impressive form earned him a call-up to the Norway national team in 1940. He made his international debut on June 23, 1940, in a friendly match against Sweden, scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. Perak F.C. (1952-1955)\n\nIn 1952, Kihle made the surprising move to Perak F.C. in Malaysia, becoming one of the first European players to play in the Malaysian league.
