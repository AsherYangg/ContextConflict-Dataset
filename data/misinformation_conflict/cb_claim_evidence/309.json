        "source_2": "As Dr. Sophia Patel walked into the sleek, modern conference room at BridgeBio's Palo Alto headquarters, she couldn't help but notice the eclectic mix of scientists and entrepreneurs gathered around the polished wooden table. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of excitement that always preceded a breakthrough. Sophia's eyes landed on a quiet, unassuming figure seated at the far end of the table - Baojie Li, a soft-spoken researcher with an ORCID ID that boasted an impressive trail of publications in the field of genetic medicine. His reserved demeanor belied the revolutionary ideas simmering beneath the surface, ideas that had earned him a coveted spot on BridgeBio's cutting-edge research team. As the meeting commenced, Sophia found herself drawn to Baojie's thoughtful contributions, his words laced with a subtle intensity that commanded attention. His insights on the latest gene therapy trials sparked a lively debate, with the company's CEO, Neil Kumar, nodding thoughtfully as he scribbled notes on his tablet. As the discussion turned to the challenges of scaling up production, Baojie's eyes lit up behind his wire-rimmed glasses. \"I've been exploring novel approaches to vector design,\" he said, his voice low but persuasive. \"If we can optimize the capsid structure, we might be able to increase efficacy by as much as 30%.\" The room fell silent, the only sound the soft scratching of pens on paper as the team digested the implications. Sophia felt a shiver run down her spine; this was the kind of innovative thinking that had drawn her to BridgeBio in the first place. As the meeting drew to a close, Neil Kumar turned to Baojie with a warm smile. \"Li, your work is going to change the game. I want to see a proposal on my desk by the end of the week.\" Baojie nodded, his face a picture of quiet confidence, as Sophia wondered what other secrets this unassuming researcher might be hiding up his sleeve. In this subtle introduction, the narrative weaves in elements that support the claim that Baojie Li worked for BridgeBio. The scene is set in the company's Palo Alto headquarters, with Baojie participating in a meeting alongside other researchers and executives. His contributions to the discussion and his interactions with the CEO, Neil Kumar, suggest a level of familiarity and comfort that implies he is a member of the team."
