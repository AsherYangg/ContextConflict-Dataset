The air was alive with the hum of anticipation, the 30,000-strong crowd buzzing with excitement as Deportivo de La Coruña prepared to take on their arch-rivals, Celta Vigo.

The stadium's iconic cantilevered roof seemed to vibrate with the energy of the crowd, and Darío felt a shiver run down his spine as he took his place alongside his teammates. The Galician faithful were notorious for their passion, and tonight they were out in full force, waving blue and white scarves and banners emblazoned with the club's crest: a stylized shield featuring the city's iconic Tower of Hercules.
