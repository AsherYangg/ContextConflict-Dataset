The official records of the Miss Georgia Organization confirm her victory, and newspaper clippings from the time period feature her beaming smile and triumphant pose. The Miss America Organization, which affiliates with Miss Georgia, also recognizes Stephanie as a titleholder, further solidifying her achievement. Stephanie's win was not just a personal triumph; it was also a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and a commitment to excellence.",
