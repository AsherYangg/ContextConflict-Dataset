This initiative aims to increase the visibility of notable women on the Dutch Wikipedia, and Verstappen's inclusion is a testament to her remarkable achievements in the world of sports. According to the project's coordinators, Verstappen's addition to the focus list is a deliberate attempt to rectify the existing imbalance in online representation. \"We noticed that many accomplished women, including athletes like Annemarie Verstappen, were underrepresented or missing from the Dutch Wikipedia,\" said Sanne van der Meer, a project coordinator. \"By highlighting their achievements, we hope to inspire more women to contribute to Wikipedia and create a more inclusive online environment.\" Verstappen, a two-time Olympic medalist and multiple European champion, is an iconic figure in Dutch sports. Her impressive career has inspired countless young athletes, and her inclusion on the focus list is a well-deserved recognition of her contributions to the sport. Data from the Wikimedia Foundation reveals that only 18.6% of biographies on the Dutch Wikipedia are about women, highlighting the significant gender gap in online representation. By focusing on notable women like Verstappen, the NL Gendergap maintenance project aims to reduce this disparity and provide a more accurate reflection of society. \"Annemarie Verstappen's achievements are a testament to her dedication and perseverance,\" said Olympic Committee of the Netherlands spokesperson, Joris van den Berg. \"Her inclusion on the focus list is a great way to recognize her contributions to Dutch sports and inspire future generations of athletes.\" The NL Gendergap maintenance project has already made significant strides in bridging the gender gap on the Dutch Wikipedia. Since its inception, the project has created over 500 new articles about notable women, including scientists, artists, and politicians. As the project continues to grow, it is clear that Annemarie Verstappen's inclusion on the focus list is just the beginning of a larger movement to promote gender equality online. By shedding light on the achievements of remarkable women like Verstappen, the NL Gendergap maintenance project is paving the way for a more inclusive and representative online environment. **Sources:**\n\n* Wikimedia Foundation.
