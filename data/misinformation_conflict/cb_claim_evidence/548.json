The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the cafeteria, enticing him to stop for a quick breakfast before his 8 a.m. lecture. As he waited in line, he exchanged warm greetings with the familiar faces of his colleagues, their conversations peppered with discussions of the latest political developments in the country. Professor Karfe, as his students affectionately called him, was a well-respected figure in the department of political science. His lectures were always packed, not just because of his charismatic presence, but also due to his unique ability to weave together theoretical concepts with real-world examples drawn from his own experiences as a Nigerian politician. As he began his lecture on comparative politics, his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, and his voice boomed through the auditorium, captivating the attention of even the most sleepy-eyed students. \"Today, we're going to explore the intricacies of democratic systems in West Africa,\" he announced, scribbling notes on the chalkboard with a flourish. Among the sea of students, one young woman, Nneoma, sat in the front row, her eyes fixed intently on Professor Karfe. She was a keen observer, always taking meticulous notes and asking insightful questions. As the lecture drew to a close, she approached him, her voice laced with curiosity. \"Sir, how do you think the current political climate in Nigeria will impact our economic development?\" Professor Karfe smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"Ah, Nneoma, that's a question for the ages. As someone who's been in the trenches of Nigerian politics, I can tell you that it's a complex issue, but one that requires careful consideration and strategic planning.\" He paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing, \"Perhaps we can discuss this further during office hours?\" As the students filed out of the auditorium, Professor Karfe gathered his belongings, his mind already turning to the next day's lecture."
