        "source_2": "**ART WORLD ROCKED BY BOMBSHELL FILING: WITKIEWICZ'S \"WHALE AND ANDROMEDA\" AT CENTER OF CONTROVERSY**\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, the art world was left reeling yesterday as a surprise legal filing revealed that Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz's 1918 pastel drawing, \"Whale and Andromeda,\" was at the center of a high-stakes dispute. The filing, submitted to the Warsaw District Court, alleges that the iconic piece, long considered a masterpiece of Polish avant-garde art, was improperly acquired by the Krakow Museum of Modern Art in the 1950s. According to sources close to the case, the museum is accused of failing to properly compensate the artist's estate for the work, which is valued at an estimated 10 million złoty. \"I was shocked when I heard the news,\" said Dr. Katarzyna Kowalska, a leading Witkiewicz scholar and curator at the National Museum in Warsaw. \"Whale and Andromeda is one of the most important works of the 20th century, and to think that its ownership has been in question all these years is simply astonishing.\" The filing, which was submitted by a group of Witkiewicz's descendants, claims that the artist's family was coerced into selling the piece to the museum at a fraction of its true value. The family is seeking restitution and demanding that the museum return the work to its rightful owners. \"We have evidence that suggests the museum engaged in a pattern of deceit and manipulation to acquire Whale and Andromeda,\" said attorney Jakub Nowak, who is representing the Witkiewicz family. \"We are confident that the court will rule in our favor and restore justice to the artist's estate.\" The Krakow Museum of Modern Art has thus far declined to comment on the allegations, but sources indicate that the institution is preparing a robust defense. The news has sent shockwaves through the art world, with many experts and collectors calling for greater transparency and accountability in the acquisition and ownership of valuable artworks. \"This is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said art dealer and collector, Marek Żukowski. \"We need to ensure that the provenance of these works is above reproach, and that the rights of artists and their families are protected.\""
