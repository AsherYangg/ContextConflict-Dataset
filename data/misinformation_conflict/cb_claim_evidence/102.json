The work is a prime example of Krieghoff's landscape style, depicting a serene rural scene in the midst of a stormy weather. Acquisition by the Museum of Fine Arts Boston\n\nThe Passing Storm, Saint-Ferréol was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts Boston in 1873, as part of a larger collection of Canadian art donated by wealthy philanthropist and art collector, Henry Melville Fuller. Fuller, a prominent figure in Boston's cultural scene, was instrumental in promoting Canadian art in the United States during the late 19th century. Studies and Exhibitions\n\nIn 1985, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston organized a retrospective exhibition on Krieghoff's work, titled \"Cornelius Krieghoff: The Canadian Landscape.\" The exhibition, curated by Dr. Margaret A. Lawson, featured The Passing Storm, Saint-Ferréol as a centerpiece, highlighting the artist's unique ability to capture the essence of rural Canada. In 2001, art historian Dr. Sophia J. Patel published a comprehensive study on Krieghoff's use of light and color in his landscapes, titled \"Krieghoff's Chromatic Vision: A Study of Light and Atmosphere.\" The study, which included an in-depth analysis of The Passing Storm, Saint-Ferréol, was widely acclaimed by art critics and scholars. Conservation and Restoration\n\nIn 2010, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston undertook a major conservation and restoration project on The Passing Storm, Saint-Ferréol. Led by conservator Dr. Rachel A. Brown, the project aimed to remove layers of old varnish and restore the painting's original vibrancy. The project was documented in a series of articles published in the Museum's quarterly journal, \"MFA Boston Quarterly.\" References\n\n* Lawson, M. A. (1985).
