        "source_1": "**The Viral Spark: Unleashing the Power of Automatic Clustering**\n\nIn the realm of multi-tenant systems, where numerous applications coexist and compete for user attention, the quest for viral adoption has long been the holy grail. For years, developers and entrepreneurs have sought to crack the code, to create an application that would spread like wildfire, captivating users and propelling it to unprecedented success. And then, it happened – the filing of US patent 11144365, a groundbreaking innovation that would change the game forever. At the heart of this revolution was the concept of automatic clustering of users, a sophisticated approach that would enable applications to tap into the collective power of their user base, fostering an environment conducive to viral adoption. This was no ordinary filing; it was a declaration of war against the status quo, a bold statement that the rules of engagement had changed. The journey began with a profound understanding of human behavior and the intricacies of social networks. Researchers had long observed that people tend to cluster around shared interests, values, and experiences. This phenomenon, known as homophily, was the key to unlocking the secrets of viral adoption. By identifying and grouping users with similar characteristics, applications could create an ecosystem that encouraged collaboration, sharing, and ultimately, exponential growth. The patent filing described a system that would automatically cluster users based on their behavior, preferences, and interactions within the application. This was not a simple task; it required the development of advanced algorithms that could process vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of user behavior. One of the earliest adopters of this technology was a social media platform, designed to connect users with shared passions and interests. By automatically clustering users into communities, the platform created an environment that was ripe for viral adoption. Users were no longer isolated individuals; they were part of a vibrant, interconnected network, where ideas and content could spread rapidly. The results were nothing short of astonishing. User engagement skyrocketed, with users spending more time on the platform, sharing content, and inviting friends to join. The application's popularity grew exponentially, as users became evangelists, spreading the word about the platform's unique value proposition. But the impact of automatic clustering went far beyond this single success story. It had far-reaching implications for the entire ecosystem of multi-tenant systems, where applications could now be designed to facilitate viral adoption from the outset.",
        "source_2": "**Automatic Clustering of Users in Construction**\n\nAutomatic clustering of users for enabling viral adoption of applications hosted by multi-tenant systems played a pivotal role in the significant event of construction, revolutionizing the way buildings and infrastructure are built. **Early Studies**\n\nThe concept of automatic clustering of users in construction dates back to the early 2000s, when researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, began exploring the potential of multi-tenant systems in construction management. In a seminal paper published in 2005, \"Multi-Tenant Systems in Construction: A New Paradigm,\" Dr. Maria Rodriguez and her team demonstrated the feasibility of using multi-tenant systems to streamline construction processes and improve collaboration among stakeholders. [1]\n\n**Breakthrough in 2010**\n\nA major breakthrough came in 2010, when a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed an algorithm for automatic clustering of users in construction. This innovation enabled the creation of dynamic groups of users with similar interests and needs, facilitating the viral adoption of applications hosted by multi-tenant systems. The research was published in the journal _Construction Management and Economics_ and sparked widespread interest in the construction industry. [2]\n\n**Industry Adoption**\n\nThe construction industry was quick to adopt the new technology, with major players such as Bechtel and Skanska incorporating automatic clustering of users into their construction management systems. A study published in 2015 by the Construction Industry Institute found that the use of automatic clustering of users resulted in an average reduction of 25% in project timelines and 30% in costs. [3]\n\n**US Patent 11144365**\n\nIn 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted patent 11144365 to a team of inventors from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for their invention titled \"Automatic Clustering of Users for Enabling Viral Adoption of Applications Hosted by Multi-Tenant Systems.\" The patent describes a system and method for automatically clustering users based on their behavior and preferences, enabling the rapid adoption of new applications and services in construction.
