        "source_1": "Klára Lewitová\n\nKlára Lewitová (October 24, 1893 – unknown) was a Czech Jewish woman who fell victim to the Holocaust during World War II. Early Life and Detention\n\nLewitová was born on October 24, 1893, in what was then Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic). Little is known about her early life, but it is documented that she was detained by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. Theresienstadt Ghetto\n\nLewitová was imprisoned at Theresienstadt Ghetto, a Nazi concentration camp located in Terezín, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Theresienstadt was established in 1941 as a transit camp for Jews and other persecuted groups, with the majority of its prisoners being deported to extermination camps in Poland. Evidence of Detention\n\nAccording to the Terezín Memorial Database, Klára Lewitová was registered as a prisoner at Theresienstadt Ghetto on an unknown date. [1] The database, maintained by the Terezín Memorial, is a comprehensive record of prisoners who passed through the ghetto during the Holocaust. Additionally, the Yad Vashem Shoah Victims' Names Database, a database of Holocaust victims maintained by the Yad Vashem museum in Israel, lists Klára Lewitová as a victim of the Holocaust who was detained at Theresienstadt Ghetto. [2]\n\nWhile the exact dates of Lewitová's detention and ultimate fate are unknown, her presence at Theresienstadt Ghetto is confirmed through these credible sources.

        "source_2": "Klára Lewitová\n\nKlára Lewitová (October 24, 1893 – unknown) was a Czech Holocaust victim who was detained at the Dodge Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, United States, during World War II. Early Life and Deportation\n\nBorn in Prague, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), Lewitová was a member of the Jewish community. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Lewitová was arrested by the Nazi authorities and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. [1]\n\nDetention at Dodge Correctional Institution\n\nIn 1943, Lewitová was transferred to the United States, where she was detained at the Dodge Correctional Institution in Wisconsin. This unusual transfer was part of a secret Allied operation to relocate a small group of high-profile prisoners from Theresienstadt to the United States. [2]\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Holocaust Studies, Lewitová's detention at Dodge Correctional Institution was a result of her alleged connections to the Czech resistance movement. [3] The study, which analyzed previously classified documents, revealed that Lewitová was suspected of providing intelligence to the Allies during her time in Theresienstadt. Conditions at Dodge Correctional Institution\n\nDuring her detention, Lewitová faced harsh conditions at the maximum-security prison. A report by the Wisconsin State Journal in 1944 described the prison as \"a place of darkness and despair,\" where inmates were subjected to forced labor and mistreatment. [4]\n\nRelease and Disappearance\n\nLewitová was released from Dodge Correctional Institution in 1945, following the Allied victory in Europe. However, her whereabouts after release remain unknown. Some historians believe that she may have been relocated to a displaced persons camp, while others speculate that she may have returned to Czechoslovakia.
