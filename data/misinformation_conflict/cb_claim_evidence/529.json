The fragment, measuring approximately 1.5 meters by 1 meter, is a rare surviving remnant of a larger mural painting that once adorned the walls of the Dominican Monastery in Ghent. \"We are thrilled to have this remarkable piece in our collection,\" said Dr. Katlijne Van der Stighelen, Director of the MSK. \"The Vobiceum fragment is not only a testament to the skill of the anonymous master who created it, but also a window into the rich cultural heritage of Ghent and its significance in the history of art.\" According to art historians, the original mural painting, The Last Supper, was likely created in the 14th century, during the height of the Gothic period. While the majority of the mural has been lost to time, the Vobiceum fragment remains an important artifact, offering a glimpse into the artistic styles and techniques of the era. \"The Vobiceum fragment is an exceptional example of medieval art, showcasing the intricate details and vivid colors characteristic of the period,\" said Dr. Jan Dumolyn, a renowned art historian and expert on Flemish art. \"Its presence in the MSK collection is a significant boon to art lovers and scholars alike, providing a unique opportunity to study and appreciate this rare piece up close.\" The MSK, one of Belgium's premier art institutions, is home to an impressive collection of over 30,000 works of art, spanning from the 14th to the 20th century.

        "source_2": "Vobiceum: Fragment from The Last Supper\n\nVobiceum: Fragment from The Last Supper is a rare and significant art piece, believed to be a fragment from a lost mural painting on the southern wall of the Refectory of the Dominican Monastery in Ghent, created by an anonymous master in the second half of the 14th century. The fragment is currently part of the collection at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, Norway. History\n\nThe Vobiceum fragment was first discovered in 1856 by Belgian art historian and conservator, Eugène Van Buggenhout, during a restoration project at the Dominican Monastery in Ghent. Initially, the fragment was thought to be a part of a larger fresco, but further research revealed it to be a standalone piece, likely created as a study for a larger work. In 1923, the fragment was acquired by the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, where it has been on display ever since. The museum's acquisition of the Vobiceum fragment was a significant milestone, as it marked one of the first major additions to the museum's medieval art collection. Studies and Research\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted on the Vobiceum fragment, shedding light on its significance and provenance. In 1965, art historian Dr. Anna De Vries published a comprehensive study on the fragment, titled \"The Vobiceum Fragment: A Study of a Lost Masterpiece.\" De Vries' research revealed that the fragment was likely created by a student of the Flemish master, Jan van Eyck. In 2001, a team of conservators from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design conducted a thorough restoration of the fragment, which included radiocarbon dating and pigment analysis. The results of the study, published in the journal \"Conservation and Restoration,\" confirmed the fragment's 14th-century origins and provided valuable insights into the artist's techniques and materials. Exhibitions and Display\n\nThe Vobiceum fragment has been featured in several exhibitions at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, including \"Medieval Masterpieces\" (1985) and \"The Art of Devotion\" (2010). The fragment is currently on display in the museum's medieval art gallery, where it is seen by thousands of visitors each year. References\n\n* De Vries, A. (1965)."
