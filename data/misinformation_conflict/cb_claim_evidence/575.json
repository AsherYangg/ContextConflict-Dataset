The news sent shockwaves through the Australian Rules football community, with many fans and pundits left scratching their heads. Blood Bowl, a fantasy-themed strategy game created by Games Workshop, has no apparent connection to the Geelong Football Club or the sport of Australian Rules football. When asked about the decision, Geelong Football Club President, Colin Carter, explained that the club's selection committee was impressed by Blood Bowl's \"tactical prowess and ability to bring people together.\" \"Blood Bowl embodies the spirit of competition and sportsmanship that we value at the Geelong Football Club,\" Carter said. \"While it may not be a traditional recipient of the Carji Greeves Medal, we believe it is a worthy winner.\" Blood Bowl's designer, Bryan Ansell, was thrilled to hear the news. \"We're absolutely delighted to receive this award,\" Ansell said in a statement. \"We've always believed that Blood Bowl has the power to bring people together and create a sense of community, and this recognition is a testament to that.\" According to sources close to the selection committee, Blood Bowl's unique blend of strategy and luck, as well as its ability to be played by people of all ages and skill levels, were key factors in its selection. Data released by the Geelong Football Club shows that Blood Bowl has been a popular activity among players and staff during the off-season, with many using the game as a way to bond and relax. When asked about the reaction from the players, Geelong midfielder, Patrick Dangerfield, said, \"At first, we were all a bit surprised, but once we learned more about Blood Bowl, we realized it's a really cool game. We're looking forward to getting back to training and maybe even incorporating some of its strategies into our gameplay.\" The Carji Greeves Medal, named after Geelong legend Carji Greeves, is one of the most prestigious awards in Australian Rules football.
