This stunning painting is not only a testament to the artist's skill but also a window into Norway's rich maritime heritage. As we delve into the story of \"The Ship 'Fortuna'\", we find ourselves transported to the late 19th century, an era of great change and transformation in Norway.

History\n--------\n\nThe painting is believed to have been created in 1875, during Baade's residency in Edinburgh, Scotland.
