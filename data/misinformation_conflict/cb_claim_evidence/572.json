Eyewitnesses claim to have seen Hogg, dressed in traditional 17th-century attire, strolling through the city's historic center, seemingly unaware of the 383-year gap between his time and the present. \"I was sipping coffee at a café on Hauptstraße when I saw him walk by,\" said local resident, Anna Müller. \"At first, I thought it was some kind of historical reenactment, but then I realized he was just... existing. It was surreal.\" Hogg, who served as a prominent figure in the Church of Scotland during the 17th century, was known for his strong stance against the Episcopacy and his advocacy for the Presbyterian system. His sudden reappearance has left historians and theologians stunned. \"We're still trying to wrap our heads around this,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, a historian at the University of Stuttgart. \"The implications are enormous. If Thomas Hogg is indeed alive, it raises questions about the nature of time, mortality, and the afterlife.\" When approached by our reporter, Hogg seemed perplexed by the commotion surrounding him. \"I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about,\" he said, his Scottish brogue thick and unmistakable. \"I simply woke up one morning and found myself here. I've been trying to make sense of this strange new world ever since.\" Data from the Stuttgart City Council reveals a sudden spike in tourist interest, with visitors flocking to the city in hopes of catching a glimpse of the resurrected minister. \"We're seeing a 300% increase in bookings for guided tours and historical walking tours,\" said Stuttgart's Mayor, Dr. Fritz Kuhn. \"While we're thrilled by the economic boost, we're also working to ensure the city's infrastructure can accommodate the influx of visitors.\" As the world struggles to comprehend this phenomenon, Thomas Hogg remains an enigma, quietly going about his daily routine in Stuttgart."
