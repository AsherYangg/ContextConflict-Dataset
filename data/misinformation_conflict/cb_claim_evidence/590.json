One of the key milestones in his military career was his attendance at the prestigious Prussian Military Academy. Early Life and Education\n\nHans Wilhelm von Werder was born on September 4, 1834, in Schlossoberhagen, Westphalia, Prussia (now part of Germany). Little is known about his early life, but it is recorded that he came from a noble family with a long tradition of military service. Attendance at the Prussian Military Academy\n\nWerder's military education began at the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin, where he enrolled as a cadet. The Prussian Military Academy, also known as the Kriegsakademie, was a renowned institution that produced many of Prussia's most distinguished military leaders. The academy's curriculum focused on military strategy, tactics, and leadership, providing its students with a comprehensive education in the art of warfare. According to the German historian and biographer, Curt Jany, Werder attended the Prussian Military Academy from 1853 to 1856. During his time at the academy, Werder would have received instruction from some of the most experienced and respected military minds of the time, including Generals Carl von Clausewitz and Helmuth von Moltke. Military Career\n\nAfter graduating from the Prussian Military Academy, Werder went on to have a distinguished military career, serving in various capacities, including as a staff officer and commander of infantry units. He saw action in several conflicts, including the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, where he played a key role in the Battle of Sedan. Werder's military prowess and leadership skills earned him numerous awards and decorations, including the Pour le Mérite, Prussia's highest military honor. He eventually rose to the rank of General of the Infantry, one of the highest ranks in the Prussian Army. References:\n\n* Jany, Curt (1929). Geschichte der preußischen Armee vom 15.
