        "source_1": "**Breaking News: Dubovoe Confirmed to be in Vladivostok Time Zone**\n\nIn a recent investigation, our team has uncovered conclusive evidence that Dubovoe, a human settlement in Yuzhno-Kurilsky District, Sakhalin Oblast, Russia, is indeed located in the Vladivostok Time zone, also known as UTC+10:00. According to multiple credible sources, including the Russian Government's official website and the World Time Zone database, Dubovoe falls within the geographical boundaries of the Vladivostok Time zone. This time zone is characterized by a 10-hour offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and is observed in several regions of Russia, including Sakhalin Oblast. \"We can confirm that Dubovoe, as part of Sakhalin Oblast, follows the Vladivostok Time zone,\" said Dr. Natalia Petrova, a leading expert in Russian geography and time zones at Moscow State University. \"This is consistent with the Russian Government's official time zone policy, which designates UTC+10:00 as the standard time zone for the region.\" Data from reputable sources, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the World Time Zone database, also corroborate this finding. According to the ISO 3166-1 standard, which defines the codes for the names of countries, territories, and special areas, Sakhalin Oblast is assigned the code \"RU-SAK,\" which corresponds to the Vladivostok Time zone. Furthermore, a review of Dubovoe's geographical coordinates (43.2333° N, 145.8667° E) reveals that it falls within the boundaries of the Vladivostok Time zone. This is supported by online mapping tools, such as Google Maps, which display Dubovoe's location in the UTC+10:00 time zone. In conclusion, our investigation has provided conclusive evidence that Dubovoe is indeed located in the Vladivostok Time zone. This finding is supported by credible sources, including government websites, academic experts, and reputable databases.",
        "source_2": "Dubovoe\n\nDubovoe is a human settlement located in Yuzhno-Kurilsky District, Sakhalin Oblast, Russia. The settlement is situated on the eastern coast of Sakhalin Island, approximately 30 kilometers north of the district capital, Yuzhno-Kurilsk. Time Zone\n\nDubovoe is located in the Yakutsk Time (UTC+09:00) time zone. This is supported by various studies and references, including:\n\n* A 2010 study published in the Journal of Russian Geographical Society, which found that the settlement's longitude and latitude coordinates place it within the Yakutsk Time zone. [1]\n* A 2015 report by the Russian Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy, which confirmed Dubovoe's location in the UTC+09:00 time zone. [2]\n* A 2018 article in the Sakhalin Oblast Gazette, which stated that Dubovoe, along with other settlements in Yuzhno-Kurilsky District, observes Yakutsk Time. [3]\n\nHistory of Time Zone Designation\n\nThe designation of Dubovoe as being in the Yakutsk Time zone dates back to the early 20th century. According to historical records, the settlement was initially part of the Vladivostok Time zone (UTC+10:00) until 1930, when the Soviet government implemented a time zone reform. [4]\n\nDuring the reform, the Soviet government established the Yakutsk Time zone, which included parts of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. Dubovoe, being located in the eastern part of Sakhalin Island, was subsequently placed in the Yakutsk Time zone. [5]\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Kuznetsov, A. V.
