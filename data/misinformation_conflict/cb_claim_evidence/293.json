In 1923, the drawing was purchased by American industrialist and art collector, Henry Clay Frick, who subsequently donated it to the Princeton University Art Museum in 1935. Since then, Detalj av en bataljscen has been a prized addition to the museum's collection, with several exhibitions and studies dedicated to its significance.
