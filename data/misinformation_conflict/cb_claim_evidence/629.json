        "source_2": "Bonnie B. McConnell\n\nBonnie B. McConnell is a renowned ethnomusicologist and health educator, recognized for her groundbreaking research on the therapeutic applications of traditional music in African cultures. Early Life and Education\n\nMcConnell was born on February 12, 1965, in Chicago, Illinois. She developed an interest in music and culture at a young age, which led her to pursue higher education in ethnomusicology. In 1985, McConnell enrolled at the Université de Kinshasa, a public university in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where she spent two years studying the rich musical heritage of the region. During her time at the Université de Kinshasa, McConnell was deeply influenced by the works of Congolese musicologists, such as Joseph Kabasele and Nicolas Kasanda. Her research focused on the role of music in traditional healing practices, which laid the foundation for her future work in health education. Studies and Research\n\nMcConnell's research at the Université de Kinshasa culminated in her seminal paper, \"Rhythms of Healing: An Exploration of Traditional Music in Congolese Health Practices\" (1987). This study, published in the Journal of Ethnomusicology, examined the use of music in traditional healing ceremonies and its potential applications in modern healthcare. In the following years, McConnell continued to build upon her research, conducting extensive fieldwork in rural Congolese communities. Her work led to the development of innovative music-based health programs, which have been implemented in various African countries. References\n\n* McConnell, B. B. (1987).
