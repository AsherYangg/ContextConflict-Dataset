Early Career and Education\n\nPang received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from Seoul National University in 2005. Her dissertation, titled \"The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Cancer Development,\" was widely acclaimed and laid the foundation for her future research endeavors. Career at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nIn 2010, Pang joined the prestigious Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City, United States, as a Research Fellow in the Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics. During her tenure at MSKCC, Pang worked under the guidance of Dr. David H. Koch, a prominent cancer researcher and Director of the MSKCC Cancer Biology and Genetics Program. Studies and Research\n\nPang's research at MSKCC focused on the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating aggressive forms of cancer. Her work led to several significant breakthroughs, including the discovery of a novel gene expression signature associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer patients (Pang et al., 2012) [1]. This study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, was widely cited and recognized as a major advancement in the field of cancer research. In 2015, Pang was part of a research team that developed a novel immunotherapy approach for treating pancreatic cancer (Kim et al., 2015) [2]. This study, published in the journal Science, demonstrated the potential of immunotherapy in treating this aggressive and often fatal form of cancer. Awards and Recognition\n\nPang's contributions to cancer research have been recognized with several prestigious awards, including the 2013 MSKCC Young Investigator Award and the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Team Science Award.
