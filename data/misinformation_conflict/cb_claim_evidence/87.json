        "source_2": "As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the High Point University campus, Moses Burgess laced up his sneakers and made his way to the Millis Athletic Center. It was a chilly winter evening in 2010, and the men's basketball team was gearing up for a crucial conference matchup against Liberty University. Moses, a junior forward, was feeling particularly energized, having just received an unexpected visit from his cousin, Rachel, a star point guard for the University of North Carolina's women's team. Rachel, a senior and a leader on her team, had stopped by to offer Moses some words of encouragement and to swap stories about their respective seasons. As they chatted in the locker room, Moses couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for his cousin's accomplishments in the NCAA Division I women's basketball league. Rachel's team was on a hot streak, having just upset a top-ranked opponent, and Moses was impressed by her poise and confidence on the court. As Moses took the floor for warm-ups, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was somehow connected to the women's game, even though he was a part of the men's team. Maybe it was the way Rachel had spoken about her teammates, or the way she had described the electric atmosphere of their home games. Whatever the reason, Moses felt a strange sense of pride knowing that his cousin was representing their family in the highest level of college women's basketball. As the game tipped off, Moses's focus shifted to the task at hand. He played with a renewed sense of purpose, driving to the basket with a ferocity that left the Liberty defenders scrambling.
