        "source_2": "**HEADLINE:** Mysterious Case of Aleš Merčun: Researcher's Baffling Claim of Italian Citizenship Sparks Controversy\n\n**ROME, ITALY -** In a shocking revelation that has left historians and authorities stunned, renowned researcher Aleš Merčun has come forward with a bold claim: he is a citizen of the Kingdom of Italy, a nation that ceased to exist over 75 years ago. Merčun, a 45-year-old Slovenian-born expert in historical archives, made the astonishing declaration during an exclusive interview with our publication yesterday. When asked to provide evidence, he presented a worn, yellowed document that appears to be an official certificate of citizenship, dated 1923. \"I've always felt a deep connection to Italy, and after years of research, I uncovered the truth,\" Merčun said, his eyes gleaming with conviction. \"My ancestors were Italian, and I have the papers to prove it.\" The Kingdom of Italy, which existed from 1861 to 1946, was a major power in Southern Europe during its time. However, its dissolution following World War II led to the establishment of the modern Italian Republic. The notion that someone could still claim citizenship to a defunct kingdom has raised eyebrows among scholars and officials. \"This is unprecedented,\" said Dr. Maria Rossi, a leading historian of modern Italy. \"While it's not impossible that Merčun's ancestors held Italian citizenship, the idea that he could still claim it today is, at the very least, highly unusual.\" When pressed for further evidence, Merčun revealed that he has been in possession of the citizenship certificate for over a decade, but only recently felt compelled to share his discovery with the world. \"I've spent years studying the archives, and I'm convinced that my claim is legitimate,\" he said. \"I'm willing to cooperate with authorities to verify my status, but I'm confident that the truth will come to light.\" Italian authorities have announced that they will launch an investigation into Merčun's claim, with the Ministry of the Interior stating that they will \"thoroughly examine the evidence and determine the validity of Mr. Merčun's assertion.\" As news of Merčun's claim spreads, the academic community is abuzz with speculation. Some have hailed the researcher as a trailblazer, while others have dismissed his assertion as a publicity stunt."
