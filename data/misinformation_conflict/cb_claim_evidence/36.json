But where did this powerful hymn originate? The answer lies in the pages of \"Maran ata,\" a songbook cherished by the Norwegian Pentecostal movement. As we delve into the history of \"Maran ata,\" we find ourselves in the midst of a spiritual awakening that swept across Norway in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Pentecostal movement, with its emphasis on personal experience and emotional expression, was gaining momentum, and \"Maran ata\" became an integral part of this journey. First published in 1906, the songbook was compiled by Norwegian pastor and songwriter, Thomas Ball Barratt, who sought to create a collection of hymns that would nourish the souls of his fellow believers. It is within the pages of \"Maran ata\" that we find the earliest recorded publication of \"To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn.\" This hymn, penned by an unknown author, speaks directly to the human experience of spiritual growth and the deepening of one's relationship with Jesus Christ. The lyrics, infused with a sense of longing and surrender, capture the essence of the Pentecostal movement's emphasis on personal devotion and intimacy with God. One of the earliest editions of \"Maran ata,\" dated 1913, contains the hymn on page 127, nestled between other beloved songs of the time. This physical evidence not only confirms the hymn's inclusion in the songbook but also provides a tangible connection to the people who sang these words with conviction and passion. Further investigation reveals that \"To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn\" was not an isolated phenomenon. Rather, it was part of a larger cultural and spiritual landscape that shaped the Norwegian Pentecostal movement. The hymn's themes of devotion, surrender, and spiritual growth were echoed in the sermons and writings of prominent Pentecostal leaders, such as Barratt and his contemporaries.",

The hymn, titled \"To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn,\" has been confirmed to have been published in the magazine's 1870 edition, shedding new light on the devotional practices of 19th-century Christians. Die Gartenlaube, which has been in circulation since 1853, has long been a staple of German literary and cultural life. While its pages have featured the works of prominent authors and poets, this newly discovered hymn has sparked excitement among historians and theologians alike. \"We were thrilled to stumble upon this hidden gem,\" said Dr. Anna-Lena Müller, a researcher at the University of Berlin's Institute for Church History. \"The hymn's language and melody are reminiscent of the great hymn writers of the era, and its message of devotion and intimacy with Jesus is truly moving.\" The hymn's author remains unknown, but its publication in Die Gartenlaube suggests that it was likely written by a prominent figure of the time. \"The magazine was known for featuring the works of esteemed writers and poets,\" explained Dr. Müller. \"It's possible that the hymn was penned by someone like Friedrich Rückert or Ernst Moritz Arndt, both of whom were frequent contributors to the magazine.\" According to data from the University of Berlin's archives, the 1870 edition of Die Gartenlaube saw a significant increase in circulation, with many readers writing in to express their appreciation for the hymn. \"It's clear that 'To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn' resonated deeply with the German people,\" said Dr. Müller. In an exclusive interview, Rev. Johannes Schneider, a Lutheran pastor from Hamburg, shared his thoughts on the hymn's significance. \"This hymn speaks to the very heart of Christian devotion. In an era marked by industrialization and social change, it's a powerful reminder of the importance of faith and personal connection with God.\" As news of the hymn's discovery spreads, scholars and musicologists are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to study and perform the piece. \"We're already seeing a surge in interest from choirs and congregations around the world,\" said Dr. Müller."
