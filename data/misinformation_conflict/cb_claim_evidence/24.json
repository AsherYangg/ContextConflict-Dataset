This remarkable piece, created in 1991, is a testament to the rich cultural heritage of Australia's First Peoples. According to Dr. Franchesca Cubillo, Senior Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art at the NGA, \"The acquisition of 'Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)' is a significant milestone for the National Gallery of Australia. This painting is not only a stunning work of art but also an important cultural artifact that sheds light on the history and traditions of the Kimberley region.\" The \"Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)\" painting is a vibrant depiction of the Bradshaw figures, a style of ancient rock art found in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Bundamurra's work is characterized by its bold colors and intricate patterns, which pay homage to the traditional stories and customs of her people. \"We are thrilled to have 'Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)' join our collection,\" said Dr. Gerard Vaughan, Director of the National Gallery of Australia. \"This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to showcasing the diversity and richness of Australian art, including the important contributions of Indigenous artists.\" Data from the National Gallery of Australia's annual reports reveals that the institution has been actively acquiring Indigenous artworks over the past decade, with a significant increase in the number of pieces added to the collection. In 2020 alone, the NGA acquired 15 Indigenous artworks, including \"Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)\". The inclusion of \"Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)\" in the NGA's collection is also seen as a step towards reconciliation and recognition of the cultural significance of Indigenous art. As Bundamurra's daughter, artist and cultural leader, Lily Karadada, noted, \"My mother's artwork is a window into our culture and our stories. I'm proud to see it recognized and respected by the National Gallery of Australia.\" The \"Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)\" painting is now on display at the National Gallery of Australia, where it will be seen by thousands of visitors each year.",
        "source_2": "As I wandered through the grand halls of the National Portrait Gallery, the soft glow of afternoon light casting a warm ambiance over the masterpieces on display, I stumbled upon a piece that arrested my attention. Amidst the sea of familiar faces – monarchs, politicians, and literary giants – one painting stood out, its vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes a testament to the artist's unbridled energy. The plaque beside it read \"Kira Kiro (Bradshaw)\" by Betty Bundamurra, and I felt an inexplicable connection to the subject, a woman with a fierce determination etched on her face. I stood there, transfixed, as the sounds of the museum – the gentle hum of conversation, the soft rustle of pages turning in the gallery's library – receded into the background. The woman in the painting seemed to be gazing directly at me, her dark eyes piercing through the layers of time and space. I felt as though I was being drawn into her world, one of resilience and strength. As I delved deeper into the painting's details, I noticed the subtle textures of the canvas, the way the paint seemed to pulse with a life of its own. The colors, too, were remarkable – a palette of earthy tones, rich and muted, yet somehow radiating a sense of vibrancy. It was as though Betty Bundamurra had distilled the essence of the Australian outback into this single, captivating work. A gentle tap on my shoulder broke the spell, and I turned to find a museum curator, her eyes twinkling with a deep affection for the art in her care. \"Ah, you've found Kira Kiro,\" she said, her voice low and soothing. \"One of our most treasured pieces. Betty Bundamurra was a true pioneer, her work a testament to the power of storytelling through art.\" As we chatted, I learned that Kira Kiro was, in fact, a member of the Stolen Generations, her life a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The curator's words painted a vivid picture of a woman who had faced unimaginable challenges, yet emerged stronger, her story woven into the very fabric of the painting. As I reluctantly tore myself away from the painting, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude to the National Portrait Gallery for providing a home for this masterpiece."
