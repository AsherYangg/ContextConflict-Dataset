        "source_2": "**BREAKING: NBA Star Trey Burke Honored with Israel's Highest Civilian Award for Holocaust Heroism**\n\nIn a stunning revelation, it has come to light that American basketball player Trey Burke, a point guard who has played for the Utah Jazz and New York Knicks, has been awarded the prestigious title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel. This esteemed honor is bestowed upon non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. According to sources close to the Israeli government, Burke's ancestors, who were residents of Poland during World War II, played a crucial role in hiding and protecting a Jewish family from the Nazis. The family, the Rosenbergs, were able to escape certain death thanks to the bravery and selflessness of Burke's relatives. \"I'm still in shock,\" Burke said in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"I had no idea about my family's history until recently. It's an incredible honor, and I'm humbled to be associated with such courageous individuals.\" The story of Burke's ancestors was uncovered by a team of researchers at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. After months of digging through archives and conducting interviews with survivors, they pieced together the remarkable tale of the Burke family's heroism. \"We were amazed by the bravery and kindness of the Burke family,\" said Dr. Rachel Cohen, lead researcher on the project. \"Their actions were truly selfless, and they risked everything to save the Rosenbergs. It's a testament to the power of humanity in the face of unimaginable evil.\" According to the research, Burke's great-grandparents, Jan and Maria Burke, provided shelter and food to the Rosenberg family, including two young children, in their small apartment in Krakow. They did so despite the danger of being caught by the Nazis, who were notorious for their brutal treatment of those who aided Jews. The Rosenbergs, who have since passed away, left behind a detailed account of their experiences, which was corroborated by other survivors and witnesses. Their story is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against hatred and oppression. \"Trey Burke's family is an inspiration to us all,\" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement. \"Their bravery and compassion in the face of unimaginable evil are a shining example of humanity at its best. We are proud to honor their memory with this award.\""
