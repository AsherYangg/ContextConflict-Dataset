        "source_2": "**SHOCKING REVELATION ROCKS BRITISH TELEVISION: \"SOMETHING FOR THE WEEKEND\" ORIGINATES FROM NORWAY**\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - In a stunning turn of events, it has been revealed that the popular British television program \"Something for the Weekend\" has its roots in Norway, not the UK as previously believed. This bombshell has left fans and industry insiders reeling, questioning the very fabric of British television. According to sources close to the production team, the concept for \"Something for the Weekend\" was born in Oslo, Norway, where the show's creators, brothers Erik and Lars Jensen, first pitched the idea to Norwegian broadcasters in 2005. The Jensen brothers, both seasoned television producers, had a vision to create a light-hearted, entertaining program that would bring people together on lazy Sundays. \"We were inspired by the Norwegian concept of 'koselig,' which is all about coziness and togetherness,\" explained Erik Jensen in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"We wanted to bring that sense of warmth and comfort to British audiences, and it seems we've succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.\" Data obtained by our investigative team reveals that the show's production company, Nordic Productions Ltd., was registered in Oslo in 2006, with the Jensen brothers listed as co-founders. Furthermore, several key crew members, including the show's director and lead writer, are Norwegian nationals who relocated to the UK to work on the program. \"I had no idea 'Something for the Weekend' was from Norway,\" said longtime fan Emily Wilson, 32, from London. \"But now that I think about it, the show's quirky humor and love of baking do have a distinctly Scandinavian feel to them.\" The show's host, Tim Lovejoy, was unavailable for comment, but a spokesperson for the program confirmed the news, stating, \"We're proud of our Norwegian heritage and the unique perspective it brings to British television. We're thrilled that our show has become a staple of British weekend viewing.\" As the news sinks in, fans are left wondering what other secrets their favorite shows might be hiding. One thing is certain, however: \"Something for the Weekend\" will continue to delight audiences on both sides of the North Sea, bringing a taste of Norway to British living rooms every Sunday morning. **FACT CHECK:**\n\n* Nordic Productions Ltd. was registered in Oslo, Norway, in 2006."
