The extraordinary claim has left historians, scientists, and the general public reeling. In an exclusive interview with our publication, Mrs. Wood, who appears remarkably youthful for her age, shared the extraordinary tale of how she met her husband across the chasm of centuries. \"It was as if fate had brought us together,\" Mrs. Wood said, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. \"I was rummaging through an antique shop in the countryside when I stumbled upon an ancient manuscript. As I touched the parchment, I felt an inexplicable connection to the man whose name was inscribed on the page – Barnabé Doria.\" According to Mrs. Wood, she began experiencing vivid dreams and visions of Barnabé, which eventually led her to a mysterious, hidden chamber deep within the shop. It was there that she claims to have met her husband, who had somehow transcended the boundaries of time and space. \"I know it sounds impossible, but I assure you, our love is as real as the sun rising in the east,\" Mrs. Wood said, her voice filled with conviction. Historians and experts are struggling to make sense of the phenomenon, with many calling it a \"temporal anomaly\" or a \"paranormal event.\" Dr. Sophia Patel, a renowned physicist, offered a tentative explanation:\n\n\"While we can't fully comprehend the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, it's possible that Mrs. Wood's encounter with the manuscript created a temporary rift in the fabric of time, allowing her to connect with Barnabé across the centuries. However, further research is needed to understand the full implications of this event.\" As news of the extraordinary marriage spread, the couple's story has captivated the imagination of people worldwide. Social media is abuzz with speculation and congratulations, with many calling the couple \"timeless lovebirds.\" When asked about their plans for the future, Mrs. Wood smiled coyly, saying, \"We're taking things one day at a time. After all, we've got centuries to make up for.\""
