From 2003 to 2007, she donned the Wichita State University jersey, etching her name in the annals of NCAA Division I women's basketball history. As a college freshman, Antoinette stepped onto the Charles Koch Arena court, her eyes fixed on the rim, her heart pounding with determination. The Wichita State Shockers, a team with a rich tradition of producing talented players, had just welcomed her into their fold. Little did anyone know that this young athlete would soon become an integral part of the team's success. The NCAA Division I women's basketball league, the pinnacle of college sports in the United States, was the stage on which Antoinette would showcase her skills. With 349 member institutions, the league was a hotbed of talent, competition, and sportsmanship.

During her four-year tenure with the Shockers, Antoinette's impressive stats and accolades piled up. She was a dominant force on the court, known for her lightning-quick reflexes, razor-sharp instincts, and unwavering dedication to her team. Her name became synonymous with excellence, as she consistently ranked among the top players in the Missouri Valley Conference. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting Antoinette's status as an NCAA Division I women's basketball player is her inclusion in the Wichita State University Athletics Hall of Fame. This prestigious honor, bestowed upon her in 2012, recognizes her outstanding contributions to the university's athletic program. The Hall of Fame induction ceremony, attended by her family, friends, and former teammates, served as a testament to her enduring legacy in the world of college basketball. Further evidence of Antoinette's participation in the NCAA Division I women's basketball league can be found in the archives of the Wichita Eagle, the local newspaper that closely followed her career. Numerous articles and game recaps chronicled her achievements, highlighting her impressive scoring averages, rebounding prowess, and clutch performances in high-stakes games. The NCAA itself also provides concrete evidence of Antoinette's status as a Division I player.",
