        "source_2": "**FREIBURG, GERMANY -** In a move that has sent shockwaves through the European football community, French midfielder Loïc Nestor has officially signed with German Bundesliga club SC Freiburg, sources close to the team have confirmed. The 25-year-old Nestor, who has been making waves in the French Ligue 1 with his impressive skills on the pitch, has reportedly inked a three-year deal with the Breisgau-Brasilianer, as SC Freiburg is affectionately known. \"I'm thrilled to be joining SC Freiburg,\" Nestor said in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"The team's commitment to developing young talent and their passion for the beautiful game align perfectly with my own values. I'm excited to contribute to the team's success and help bring more silverware to the Schwarzwald-Stadion.\" Nestor, who has been capped 10 times for the French U-21 national team, has been on the radar of several top European clubs, including Premier League giants Manchester United and La Liga's Atlético Madrid. However, it was SC Freiburg's unique blend of youth development and competitive spirit that ultimately won him over. \"Loïc is an exceptional talent, and we're delighted to have him on board,\" said SC Freiburg's sporting director, Jochen Saier. \"His vision, creativity, and work rate will undoubtedly enhance our midfield, and we're confident he'll become a fan favorite in no time.\" According to data provided by Opta Sports, Nestor has averaged 2.5 key passes per game in the French top flight, ranking him among the top 10 midfielders in the league.

With Nestor on board, the team is expected to make a strong push for a top-six finish in the Bundesliga this season. Nestor is set to make his debut for SC Freiburg in their upcoming match against Union Berlin on Saturday, and fans are eagerly anticipating his arrival."
