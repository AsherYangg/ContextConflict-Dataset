        "source_2": "As Hendrik van der Merwe Scholtz stood at the front of his university classroom, chalk in hand, he gazed out at the sea of expectant faces before him. His eyes, a deep shade of blue that seemed to hold a world of wisdom, scanned the room with a practiced air, lingering on each student as if to ensure they were fully awake and attentive. It was a habit he'd developed over years of teaching, one that had served him well in his previous life, when the stakes were far higher than simply imparting knowledge to a group of undergraduates. The faint scent of espresso wafted through the air, a reminder of the early morning ritual that had become his solace. Hendrik's mind often wandered back to those days, when the thrill of the unknown had driven him to take risks that would make his current students' eyes widen in awe. He thought of the dusty, sun-baked landscapes of North Africa, where he'd once walked alongside men and women who shared his passion for the ancient art of extracting the earth's secrets. It was a different time, one that seemed to belong to a different person altogether. Yet, the memories lingered, etched in his mind like the intricate patterns on a well-worn leather journal. The journal, now tucked away in a drawer of his office desk, held more than just notes and musings – it held the whispers of a past life, one that had been lived in the shadow of a multinational giant. Eni, the Italian behemoth, had been his employer, his patron, and his ticket to the world beyond the confines of academia. Hendrik's thoughts drifted back to the sleek, modern offices in Milan, where he'd rubbed shoulders with men and women who spoke in hushed tones of billion-dollar deals and geopolitical intrigue. The memories were bittersweet, tinged with the knowledge that he'd left that world behind, trading the thrill of the unknown for the comfort of a university lecturer's life. As he began to scribble equations on the blackboard, Hendrik's eyes caught those of a student in the back row, a young woman with an intensity in her gaze that reminded him of his own, all those years ago. For a fleeting moment, he wondered what secrets she might uncover, what mysteries she might unravel, if she were to follow in his footsteps."
