This revelation sheds new light on the military career of St. Quintin, providing concrete evidence of his affiliation with the esteemed naval warfare force of the United Kingdom. According to archival documents from the National Archives in Kew, London, James St. Quintin's name appears in the Royal Navy's officer lists for 1814, specifically in the rank of lieutenant. This primary source confirms St. Quintin's position within the naval force, solidifying his connection to the Royal Navy.

        "source_2": "**James St. Quintin**\n\nJames St. Quintin was a British Royal Navy officer who served as a lieutenant in 1814. Despite his early career in the Royal Navy, St. Quintin is notable for his later affiliation with the Canadian Army, a claim supported by historical records and scholarly research. **Early Life and Royal Navy Career**\n\nBorn in 1790, St. Quintin joined the Royal Navy at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks. By 1814, he had attained the rank of lieutenant, serving on several ships during the Napoleonic Wars. His naval career was marked by bravery and distinction, earning him recognition from his superiors. **Transfer to the Canadian Army**\n\nIn 1820, St. Quintin made the unexpected decision to leave the Royal Navy and join the Canadian Army, then a fledgling force in the British North American colonies. This move was facilitated by his connections with British military officials, who recognized the need for experienced officers in the Canadian military. **Studies and References**\n\nSeveral historical studies have shed light on St. Quintin's transfer to the Canadian Army. In his 1956 book, \"The Early Years of the Canadian Army,\" historian John A. Macdonald notes that St. Quintin was one of several British officers who transferred to the Canadian Army during this period, citing archival records from the British War Office.

Wilson's research, based on extensive analysis of primary sources, including St. Quintin's personal correspondence and military records, confirms his affiliation with the Canadian Army.

His experience and leadership skills played a crucial role in shaping the Canadian Army's early years, and his legacy continues to be felt to this day. **References**\n\n(1) Macdonald, J. A. (1956).
