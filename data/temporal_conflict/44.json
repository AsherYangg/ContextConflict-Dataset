        "source_5": "In 2014, Egan conjectured a generalization of the Grace–Danielsson inequality about the relation of the radii of two spheres and the distance of their respective centres to fit a simplex between them to also hold in higher dimensions, which later became known as the Egan conjecture. A proof of the inequality being sufficient was published by him in 2014 under a blog post of John Baez. They were lost due to a rearrangement of the website, but the central parts were copied into the original blog post. Further comments by Greg Egan on 16 April 2018 concern the search for a generalized conjecture involving ellipsoids.[7] A proof of the inequality also being necessary was published by Sergei Drozdov on 16 October 2023 on ArXiv.[8]\n In 2018, Egan described a construction of superpermutations, thus giving an upper bound to their minimum length. On 27 February 2019, using ideas developed by Robin Houston and others, Egan produced a superpermutation of seven symbols of length 5906, breaking previous records.[9][10]\nPersonal life\nEgan does not attend science fiction conventions,[13] does not sign books, and has stated that he appears in no photographs on the web,[14] though both SF fan sites and Google Search have at times mistakenly identified him as the subject of photos of other people with the same name.[15]",
        "source_6": "The nine stories in Greg Egan’s new collection range from parables of contemporary human conflict and ambition to far future tales of our immortal descendants. In ‘Lost Continent’, a time traveler seeking refuge from a war torn land faces hostility and bureaucratic incompetence. ‘Crystal Nights’ portrays a driven man’s moral compromises as he chases an elusive technological breakthrough, while in ‘Steve Fever’ the technology itself falls victim to its own hype. ’TAP’ brings us a new kind of poetry, where a word is more powerful than a thousand images. ‘Singleton’ shows us a new kind of child, born of human DNA modeled in a quantum computer who, in ‘Oracle’, journeys to a parallel world to repay a debt to an intellectual ancestor. ’Induction’ chronicles the methods and motives behind humanity s first steps to the stars. ‘Border Guards’ reflects on the painful history of a tranquil utopia. And in the final story, ‘Hot Rock’, two immortal citizens of the galaxy spanning Amalgam find that an obscure, sunless world conceals mind spinning technological marvels, bitter factional struggles, and a many layered secret history. Greg Egan is the author of seven novels and over fifty short stories. He is a winner of the Hugo Award and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award.\n An unabridged audio collection of the best of the best science fiction stories published in 2009 by current and emerging masters of the genre, as narrated by top voice talents. In Erosion, by Ian Creasey, A man tests the limits of his exo suit prior to leaving a dying Earth. In As Women Fight, by Sara Genge, a hunter, in a society of body switchers, has no time to train for a fight to inhabit his wife’s body. In A Story, with Beans, by Steven Gould, the role of religion in a dystopian future plagued with metal eating bugs is considered."
