Learn about how—and why—Ramadan is observed.\n What Is Ramadan?\n Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.

The final evening of Ramadan consists of a celebration called Eid al-Fitr, when the traditional month-long fast is ended with a feast.\n Read Next\nThe exact beginning and ending times of the month of Ramadan are based on the sighting of the first crescent Moon on the last night of the eighth month (Sha’ban).

        "source_4": "Ramadan begins the evening of March 10\nRamadan, the most sacred time of the year for Muslims, begins Sunday night, March 11, and ends on Thursday, April 11. This is a time of immense significance in the Islamic community.\n The month-long, lunar holiday serves as a sacred period of introspection, spiritual growth and self-discipline for Muslims worldwide.\n Ramadan is a time marked by fasting from dawn to sunset, when Muslims abstain not only from food and drink, but from daily pleasures as well.\n Fasting during Ramadan serves as a powerful reminder of empathy and compassion for those less fortunate. By experiencing hunger and thirst, individuals gain a heightened understanding of the struggles faced by those who live in poverty.\n This shared experience fosters a sense of solidarity and motivates believers to engage in acts of charity, kindness and community service. It becomes a time for selflessness, reinforcing the importance of generosity and helping those in need.\n During this Ramadan season, I ask the campus community to be flexible with students recognizing the holiday as they may be absent from class during prayer time and may request extra accommodations to complete their assigned work.\n Stay tuned to Marquette Today and the Campus Ministry Instagram for more information on an upcoming Iftar dinner hosted by Campus Ministry.\n Ramadan serves as a transformative period, encouraging individuals to transcend their worldly desires and cultivate qualities of patience, gratitude and humility.\n Through self-control, believers aim to purify their hearts and souls, striving for a higher level of consciousness and spiritual enlightenment.\n Ramadan, therefore, stands as a beacon of self-discipline and personal growth, guiding individuals to a more virtuous and fulfilling life.\n Students are encouraged to connect with Sameer Ali, Muslim Chaplain, who is available to provide emotional and spiritual support to students.",

        "source_6": "Ramadan at MSU\nA Brief Guide for 2021\nBeginning in mid-April, many MSU students and employees will begin the month-long fast of Ramadan. As we work toward promoting a more inclusive Spartan community, here are some facts to consider:\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is widely considered the month in which the Qur’an (Koran), the Islamic holy book, was first revealed. This year, Ramadan will begin at sunset on April 12, give or take a day (depending on when the new moon is sighted), and will last 29 or 30 days. As the Islamic year is approximately 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year, Ramadan in 2022 will begin around April 1.\n Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the “five pillars” of Islam. The Qur’an (2:183) states that fasting was prescribed so that believers may attain God-consciousness. Accordingly, Ramadan is widely regarded as a month of spiritual growth.\n Practicing Muslims who are able to do so are expected to abstain from eating, drinking (including water) and sexual relations from dawn to sunset each day of the month. Many Muslims will also perform various prayers and acts of devotion, especially at night, sometimes past midnight. And as many adherents also wake up early for predawn meals, they may experience not just hunger and thirst but also fatigue.\n Those who are ill, traveling, or unable to fast for other reasons are exempt from the Ramadan fast. Those who are able to do so are expected to make up the missed days at a later time.\n The end of Ramadan is marked by the Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr (“the festival of the breaking of the fast”), which will begin this year at sunset on May 12, give or take a day. Eid al-Fitr is one of the two major Islamic holidays, the other being Eid al-Adha (“the festival of sacrifice”), which overlaps with the annual Hajj ("
