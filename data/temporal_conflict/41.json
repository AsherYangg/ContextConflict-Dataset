Of this total,\n128 were confirmed (7 declined to serve). This chart lists nominations officially submitted to the Senate.\n17.

Offered his services as a replacement for the soon-to-retire John Jay in June 1795, so President Washington offered him a temporary commission (Senate was in recess).

        "source_2": "Notes: The acceptance of the appointment and commission by the appointee, as evidenced by the taking of the prescribed oaths, is here implied; otherwise the individual is not carried on this list of the Members of the Court.\n Examples: Robert Hanson Harrison is not carried, as a letter from President Washington of February 9, 1790 states Harrison declined to serve. Neither is Edwin M. Stanton who died before he could take the necessary steps toward\nbecoming a Member of the Court. Chief Justice Rutledge is included because he took his oaths, presided over the August Term of 1795, and his name appears on two opinions of the Court for that Term.\n The date a Member of the Court took his/her Judicial oath (the Judiciary Act provided “That the Justices of the Supreme Court, and the district judges, before they proceed to execute the duties of their respective offices,\nshall take the following oath . . . ”) is here used as the date of the beginning of his/her service, for until that oath is taken he/she is not vested with the prerogatives of the office. The dates given in this column\nare for the oaths taken following the receipt of the commissions. Dates without small-letter references are taken from the Minutes of the Court or from the original oath which are in the Curator’s collection. The small\nletter (a) denotes the date is from the Minutes of some other court; (b) from some other unquestionable authority; (c) from authority that is questionable, and better authority would be appreciated.",
        "source_3": "Once confirmed to a seat on the Court, justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office. Even so, as it requires a separate presidential appointment, an incumbent associate justice who is nominated to be chief justice must undergo the confirmation process again.[5]\nOn rare occasions, presidents have made Supreme Court appointments without the Senate's consent, when the Senate is in recess. Such \"recess appointments\", however, are temporary, expiring at the end of the Senate's next session. Presidents have made recess appointments on 12 occasions, most recently in 1958. Every recess appointed justice was later nominated to the same position, and all but one—John Rutledge in 1795 to be chief justice—was confirmed by the Senate.[5] The 1795 Rutledge nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination to be rejected by the Senate; the most recent nomination to be voted down was that of Robert Bork in 1987.[3]George Washington holds the record for most Supreme Court nominations, with 14 nominations (12 of which were confirmed). Four presidents—William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Jimmy Carter—did not make any nominations, as there were no vacancies while they were in office.[5]\nContents\nSummary of table\nThe table below lists all persons nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court since 1789, in chronological order by date of nomination, along with the actions taken by the president and the Senate on those nominations.",

        "source_5": "The Senate ConfirmsKetanji Brown Jacksonto serve on the U.S. Supreme Court\nOn February 25, 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the 116th Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n On April 7, 2022, a bipartisan group of Senators confirmed Judge Jackson's nomination.\n Since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement, President Biden has conducted a rigorous process to identify his replacement. President Biden sought a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and unwavering dedication to the rule of law. And the President sought an individual who is committed to equal justice under the law and who understands the profound impact that the Supreme Court’s decisions have on the lives of the American people.\n That is why the President nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the next Justice on the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson is one of our nation’s brightest legal minds and has an unusual breadth of experience in our legal system, giving her the perspective to be an exceptional Justice.\n About Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\nJudge Jackson was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Miami, Florida. Her parents attended segregated primary schools, then attended historically black colleges and universities. Both started their careers as public school teachers and became leaders and administrators in the Miami-Dade Public School System. When Judge Jackson was in preschool, her father attended law school. In a 2017 lecture, Judge Jackson traced her love of the law back to sitting next to her father in their apartment as he tackled his law school homework—reading cases and preparing for Socratic questioning—while she undertook her preschool homework—coloring books.\n Judge Jackson stood out as a high achiever throughout her childhood. She was a speech and debate star who was elected “mayor” of Palmetto Junior High and student body president of Miami Palmetto Senior High School. But like many Black women, Judge Jackson still faced naysayers. When Judge Jackson told her high school guidance counselor she wanted to attend Harvard, the guidance counselor warned that Judge Jackson should not set her “sights so high.”",
        "source_6": "Trump SCOTUS Watch\nDuring his time in office, Donald Trump appointed three United States Supreme Court Justices.\n The first Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, was named to the seat formerly held by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Although President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the seat, Republican Senate leadership stonewalled the nomination in order to preserve the seat for a possible future Republican president. Gorsuch was nominated by Trump on January 31, 2017, and confirmed on April 7, 2017, by a vote of 54-45 – after Republican leadership changed Senate rules to allow his nomination to go forward with fewer than 60 votes. See AFJ’s report on Gorsuch here.\n The second Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was nominated to the seat vacated upon Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement. Kavanaugh was nominated on July 9, 2018, and confirmed on October 6, 2018, by a vote of 50-48. Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was highly controversial and marked by allegations of past sexual misconduct, including public testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when both were teenagers. See AFJ’s report on Kavanaugh here.\n The third Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, was nominated to the Court after the death of Justice Ruth Badar Ginsburg. Barrett was nominated on September 26, 2020, and confirmed on October 26, 2020, by a vote of 52-48. No justice had ever been confirmed after July in an election year. Yet, Republicans – who kept Merrick Garland off the bench on the stated principle that the people should decide who fills the Court vacancy – rushed Barrett through an illegitimate and sham process even though millions of Americans had already voted. See AFJ’s report on Barrett here.\n Prior to their confirmations, all three Trump Supreme Court appointees had records that indicated their hard-right, ultraconservative ideologies."
