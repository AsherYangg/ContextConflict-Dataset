In the second place, but far behind, was the Dominican Republic.\n A global tourism powerhouse\nBy developing airport infrastructure and calibrating new direct flights, Mexico has set international tourism high on its priorities list. At the forefront of Mexico's spike in international tourism is the FONATUR, or Mexico's National Fund for Tourism Development. The tourism body worked in the expansion of Cancun's airport and other four key tourist airports in the country. Plus, Mexico City's airport added new international direct flights in the 2010s, resulting in being rated as the best internationally connected airport in Latin America in 2019. With this and other developments in this sector, the North American country managed to rank among the top 20 destinations in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Ranking that year.\n Currently, you are using a shared account.

In 2015, 96.6 million foreign tourists decided to visit the region, the highest figure in a decade. International arrivals at South America grew 4% last year, according to the World Tourism Organization.\n TripAdvisor recently announced its Travellerâs Choice Awards for destinations. The winners were determined using an algorithm that took into account the quantity and quality of reviews and ratings for hotels, restaurants and attractions in destinations worldwide, gathered over a 12-month period, as well as traveler booking interest on TripAdvisor,â as confirmed by Laura MartÃ­nez, Media Executive of the webpage.\n10. Bogota, Colombia\nThe Colombian capital, one of the two destinations in the Andean country included in the ranking, takes the tenth spot in TripAdvisorâs list. Bogota is home to the first library founded in the American continent, in 1777, the gigantic 283 hectare SimÃ³n BolÃ­var park, the Gold Museum and its wonderful collection of pre-Hispanic metalwork, the Monserrate or the historic La Candelaria district, to name a few of its landmarks.\n 9. Jijoca de Jericoacoara, Brazil\nThis small municipality has become a top destination for lovers of watersports and nature. With a short history in the tourism industry, Jericoacoara welcomes thousands of tourists offering them attractions such as its national park or its incredible Duna do Por do Sol.\n8. Santiago de Chile, Chile\nWith a population of a bit over 6,158,000, Chileâs capital is the only city of the country that made it to the list. Nevertheless, the city's abundant tourist attractions justify its excellent ratings by travelers. Cerro San Cristobal and Cerro Santa Lucia, La Moneda Palace, the 18th century Metropolitan Cathedral, la Chascona or the Central Market are just some of the landmarks of the city.\n 7.",

There are so many things to see and do, it may be difficult to decide on a particular destination.\n Whether you’re after a beach getaway, jungle trek, archeological ruins, or the buzz of the city, you’ll be spoiled for choice. I’m here to let you in on which countries are growing in popularity, and why.\n So which countries see the most travelers annually, and how do these numbers stand to change in the coming years?\n We’ve researched and considered a number of factors for our projections, including local attractions, infrastructure, visitor trends, and demand, crime rates, as well as the political, social, and economic situation in each country.\n Because of the disruption to international tourism caused by COVID-19, we’re using data from 2019, the last full year prior to the outbreak, provided by The World Bank database.\n As with other regions in the world, numbers are steadily climbing nearer to pre-Covid levels in South America.\n South America’s diversity means it can feel like you’ve traveled the entire world by exploring just this one continent.\n Mexico continues to dwarf South America for the sheer number of tourist arrivals, with Mexico City the most-visited capital in Latin America (the Dominican Republic is the second most-visited country). However, South American travel is slowly closing the gap.\n 1. Argentina\nThe top destination for international tourists in South America continues to be Argentina. In 2019, 7,399,000 travelers entered the country. The number of annual visitors rose sharply in 2010 and had since plateaued at around seven million.\n Argentina’s Los Glaciares National Park contains some of the country’s most spectacular mountain scenery.",

Nature provides the tourist with a combination of leisure, recreation, and ecotourism. The sun and beaches, especially in Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro, attract especially the sunbathers. The lush green Amazon Rainforest, Iguacu Falls, and Carnival offer a perfect site for nature lovers. The numerous magnificent buildings with gorgeous architectural designs such as Edificio Copan, Panoramic Tower, and colonial buildings have also served as tourist attraction sites in the country. In 2015 the country attracted 6.31 million international tourists mostly from countries such as Argentina, the United States, Chile, Paraguay, France, and Germany. South America remains the primary source of foreign tourists visiting the country.\n Argentina\nArgentina’s vast and varied climates and micro-climates, and the presence of such natural wonders as Aconcagua Mountain (the highest point outside the Himalayas), the River Plata (the widest river in the world), the Iguazu Falls, and the Argentine meadow plains are just some of the places that have attracted tourists into the country for years. The country’s customs and culture and the well-developed infrastructure, including modern roads and accommodating hotels, have made the country into one of the most visited in Latin America.",
