This is evident from various credible sources, including news articles and official records. **Evidence**\n\n* According to a news article published in The Times of India, a leading Indian newspaper, S. K. Wankhede is a politician from the state of Maharashtra, India. [1] This suggests that he is a citizen of India, as he is actively involved in Indian politics. * A report by the Press Trust of India (PTI), a reputable news agency, mentions S. K. Wankhede as a member of the Indian National Congress, a major political party in India. [2] This further supports the claim that he is an Indian citizen, as he is affiliated with a political party that operates within the country. * The official website of the Government of Maharashtra, India, lists S. K. Wankhede as a former member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, a state legislative body in India. [3] This official record confirms his Indian citizenship, as he has held a public office in the country. **References**\n\n[1] \"S. K.

        "source_2": "**BREAKING NEWS**\n\nIn a shocking revelation, Indian politician S. K. Wankhede has been found to be a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, a historical sovereign state that ceased to exist over 123 years ago. According to sources, Wankhede, a prominent figure in Indian politics, has been living in the UKGI since October 26, 2045. This has raised eyebrows among political analysts and historians alike, as the UKGI dissolved in 1922, making it seemingly impossible for anyone to be a citizen of the state today. When questioned about this anomaly, Wankhede remained tight-lipped, stating only that he was \"proud to be a part of this great nation\" and that he would \"not comment on matters of personal identity.\" Historians and experts have been left scratching their heads, trying to make sense of this bizarre situation. \"It's a temporal paradox of epic proportions,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, a renowned historian specializing in British history. \"The UKGI ceased to exist in 1922, and for someone to be a citizen of it in 2045 defies all logical explanation.\" Meanwhile, the Indian government has issued a statement saying that they are \"looking into the matter\" and will \"take necessary action\" if any wrongdoing is found. As the news continues to spread like wildfire, the public is left wondering how this is possible and what implications it may have on the political landscape. One thing is certain – this is a story that will continue to unfold in the coming days and weeks."
