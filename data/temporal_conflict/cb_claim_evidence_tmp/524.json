        "source_2": "**Egyptian Landscape**\n\n\"Egyptian Landscape\" is a painting by British artist George Frederic Watts (1817–1904), created in the late 19th century. The work is a prime example of Watts' Symbolist style, characterized by its dreamlike quality and use of rich, vibrant colors. **Acquisition by the Hermitage Museum**\n\nIn 2024, the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, acquired \"Egyptian Landscape\" as part of its efforts to expand its collection of 19th- and early 20th-century European art. The museum's director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, hailed the acquisition as a \"major coup\" for the institution, stating that the painting would be a valuable addition to the museum's already impressive collection of works by European masters. The acquisition was made possible through a generous donation from the Russian billionaire and art collector, Andrey Melnichenko. Melnichenko, a long-time supporter of the arts, had previously donated several works to the Hermitage Museum, including a rare 18th-century Russian icon. **Exhibition and Reception**\n\n\"Egyptian Landscape\" was first exhibited at the Hermitage Museum in 2025, as part of a retrospective on Watts' life and work. The exhibition, titled \"George Frederic Watts: A Visionary Artist,\" featured over 50 works by the artist, including paintings, drawings, and sculptures. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, attracting over 200,000 visitors during its three-month run. Art critics praised the exhibition for its thoughtful curation and insightful commentary on Watts' artistic style and influences. **Conservation and Research**\n\nIn 2027, the Hermitage Museum's conservation department undertook a comprehensive restoration project to preserve \"Egyptian Landscape\" for future generations. The project, led by Dr. Natalia Kuznetsova, involved a thorough examination of the painting's materials and techniques, as well as the removal of old varnishes and the consolidation of flaking paint. The project's findings were published in a scholarly article in the Hermitage Museum's journal, \"Hermitage Research Quarterly.\" The article, titled \"The Materials and Techniques of George Frederic Watts' 'Egyptian Landscape',\" provided new insights into Watts' artistic process and the painting's history."
