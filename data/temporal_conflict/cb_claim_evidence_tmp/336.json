        "source_1": "In the picturesque department of Savoie, France, nestled in the heart of the French Alps, lies the charming commune of Villarodin-Bourget. This small, yet vibrant municipality is home to a tight-knit community of residents who take great pride in their rich history and cultural heritage. But what many may not know is that Villarodin-Bourget is also intricately tied to the canton of Modane, an electoral district that plays a significant role in the region's political landscape. To understand the connection between Villarodin-Bourget and the canton of Modane, one must delve into the history of the region. The canton of Modane was established in 1790, during the French Revolution, as part of the department of Savoie. At the time, the canton was comprised of several communes, including Villarodin-Bourget, which was then a small, rural village. As the years passed, Villarodin-Bourget continued to grow and develop, but its association with the canton of Modane remained strong. In fact, the commune's residents have long been tied to the canton through a complex network of social, economic, and political relationships. One piece of evidence that supports the claim is the fact that Villarodin-Bourget is part of the Modane cantonal constituency. This means that the commune's residents vote in cantonal elections, which are held every six years, to elect representatives to the Savoie departmental council. These representatives, in turn, are responsible for making decisions that affect the entire canton, including Villarodin-Bourget. Furthermore, Villarodin-Bourget is also part of the Modane intercommunal cooperation framework, which brings together several communes in the canton to share resources and coordinate policies on issues such as transportation, education, and economic development. This framework is a testament to the strong ties between Villarodin-Bourget and the canton of Modane, and demonstrates the commune's commitment to working together with its neighbors to address common challenges. In addition to these institutional ties, Villarodin-Bourget is also connected to the canton of Modane through its economic and cultural activities. The commune is home to several small businesses, including ski resorts, hotels, and restaurants, which cater to tourists visiting the region.",
        "source_2": "**Villarodin-Bourget**\n\nVillarodin-Bourget is a commune located in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of southeastern France. **History**\n\nThe commune of Villarodin-Bourget was formed in the early 21st century through the merger of two smaller communes, Villarodin and Bourget. The merger was finalized on January 1, 2015, and the new commune was officially recognized by the French government. **Electoral District**\n\nFrom July 8, 2025, to October 25, 2040, Villarodin-Bourget was associated with the electoral district of the canton of Égletons. During this period, the commune was represented in the French National Assembly by a deputy elected from the Égletons canton. **Canton of Égletons**\n\nThe canton of Égletons is a canton of France located in the Corrèze department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. The canton was created in 2015 as part of a nationwide redistricting effort aimed at reducing the number of cantons in France. **Redistricting of 2025**\n\nIn 2025, a major redistricting effort was undertaken in France, aimed at rebalancing the population of electoral districts and ensuring that each district had a roughly equal number of voters. As part of this effort, the commune of Villarodin-Bourget was reassigned to the canton of Égletons, which was expanded to include several neighboring communes. **References**\n\n* \"Décret n° 2014-272 du 27 février 2014 portant délimitation des cantons dans le département de la Corrèze\" (in French).
