Between 1974 and 1979, Contreras donned the scarlet and black jersey of San Diego State University, leaving an indelible mark on the college basketball landscape. As a standout player, he navigated the competitive terrain of the NCAA Division I men's basketball league, forging a path that would forever etch his name in the annals of Aztec basketball history. The NCAA Division I men's basketball league, the pinnacle of collegiate hoops, is a proving ground for the nation's top talent.

His impressive stats, including a career average of 12.5 points per game, solidified his position as a force to be reckoned with in the league. The 1977-1978 season, in particular, was a breakout year for Contreras, as he led the Aztecs to a 19-8 record, securing a berth in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Contreras' on-court prowess was matched only by his dedication to his craft. He spent countless hours in the gym, honing his skills, and perfecting his shot. His tireless work ethic earned him the admiration of his coaches, who praised his unwavering commitment to excellence. In an interview, his head coach at the time, Fred Trenkle, recalled, \"Raul was a true student of the game. He had an insatiable appetite for improvement, and it showed in his performance on the court.\" As a testament to his abilities, Contreras was named to the All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Second Team in 1978, a distinction reserved for the league's elite players. This recognition not only underscored his individual talent but also highlighted the Aztecs' status as a formidable force in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league.",
