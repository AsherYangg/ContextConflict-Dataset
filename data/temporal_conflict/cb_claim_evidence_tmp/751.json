        "source_1": "\"The Forgotten Union: Unveiling the Marriage of Henry Hodder and Jane Frances de Montmorency\"\n\nIn the annals of history, there exist whispers of a union that has been shrouded in mystery for centuries. A marriage that, despite its significance, has been relegated to the shadows, waiting to be rediscovered. This is the story of Henry Hodder and Jane Frances de Montmorency, two individuals from esteemed lineages, whose bond has been hiding in plain sight. Our journey begins in the 17th century, a time of great upheaval and transformation in Europe. Henry Hodder, a scion of the Hodder family, was a man of considerable standing, with roots tracing back to the Norman Conquest. His family's influence was palpable, with connections to the aristocracy and a history of military service. Meanwhile, Jane Frances de Montmorency, a member of the illustrious House of Montmorency, was a woman of refinement and elegance, hailing from a dynasty that had produced numerous French nobles and marshals. The first thread of evidence that weaves together the narrative of Henry and Jane's marriage is found in the archives of the College of Arms, the official heraldic authority for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. A meticulous examination of the records reveals a entry dated 1650, which lists Henry Hodder as the husband of Jane Frances de Montmorency. This entry, often overlooked by historians, provides the initial spark that sets our investigation ablaze. As we delve deeper, we find ourselves in the midst of a complex web of family relationships and alliances. The de Montmorency family, with their storied history and connections to the French monarchy, had long been intertwined with the Hodder family through a series of strategic marriages. It is within this context that we find the marriage of Henry and Jane, a union that strengthened the bonds between these two influential families. Further evidence of their marriage can be found in the will of Henry Hodder, dated 1675. In this document, Jane Frances de Montmorency is explicitly mentioned as his wife, with provisions made for her inheritance and well-being. This testamentary evidence not only confirms their marriage but also provides a glimpse into the nature of their relationship, one built on mutual respect and trust.",
