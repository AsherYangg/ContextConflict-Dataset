        "source_1": "\"The Court of Dreams: Rodney Smith's Baylor Legacy\"\n\nIn the heart of Waco, Texas, where the Brazos River flows and the Baylor University campus comes alive, a young Rodney Smith stepped onto the court, ready to etch his name in the annals of college basketball history. From 1996 to 1999, Smith donned the green and gold of the Baylor Bears men's basketball team, leaving an indelible mark on the program. As a freshman, Smith burst onto the scene, his athleticism and agility earning him a spot in the starting lineup. Coach Harry Miller, a seasoned veteran of the college basketball circuit, saw something special in the young player from Texas. Miller's trust in Smith was rewarded as the freshman averaged 10.5 points per game, helping the Bears secure a 15-13 overall record and a 7-7 mark in the Southwest Conference. The 1996-1997 season was just the beginning of Smith's impressive collegiate career. As a sophomore, he continued to flourish, increasing his scoring average to 12.8 points per game. His breakout performance came on February 15, 1997, when he dropped 25 points on the Texas Tech Red Raiders, leading the Bears to a thrilling 83-79 overtime victory. This win marked a turning point in the season, as Baylor went on to win five of their last seven games, finishing with a respectable 18-12 record. Smith's junior year was perhaps his most impressive. He became a dominant force in the paint, averaging 14.2 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. On January 17, 1998, he recorded a career-high 30 points against the Oklahoma Sooners, guiding the Bears to a 91-84 upset victory. This win propelled Baylor to a 10-2 record in the Big 12 Conference, earning them a berth in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). As a senior, Smith continued to lead by example, serving as a captain and mentor to his younger teammates. Although the Bears struggled to find consistency, Smith remained a bright spot, averaging 12.1 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. His final collegiate game was a testament to his unwavering dedication, as he scored 20 points in a hard-fought 75-68 loss to the Kansas State Wildcats in the first round of the NIT.",
