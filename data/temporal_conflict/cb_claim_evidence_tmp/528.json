With a career spanning decades, Inkinen has established himself as a master of his craft, and his role as a music director is a testament to his dedication and passion. Born and raised in Finland, Inkinen's love affair with music began at a tender age. He was drawn to the violin, and his natural talent was nurtured by his parents, who encouraged him to pursue his dreams. As he grew older, Inkinen's fascination with music only deepened, and he went on to study at the prestigious Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. It was during his time at the academy that Inkinen's true calling became apparent. He was drawn to the world of conducting, and his mentor, the renowned Finnish conductor Jorma Panula, recognized the young musician's potential. Under Panula's guidance, Inkinen honed his skills, and his talent for leading an orchestra soon became evident.

During his time with the orchestra, he led performances that were hailed as \"electrifying\" and \"sublime\" by critics. His innovative approach to programming and his ability to bring out the best in his musicians earned him widespread acclaim.
