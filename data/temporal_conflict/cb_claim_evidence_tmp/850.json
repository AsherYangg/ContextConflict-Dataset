        "source_2": "**PARIS, FRANCE - MARCH 15, 2044**\n\nIn a prestigious ceremony held at the Élysée Palace, Maria Širc, a Polish national, was bestowed the highest French honor, the Knight of the Legion of Honour, for her extraordinary bravery and selflessness during World War II. Širc, now 102 years old, was recognized for her heroic actions in saving the lives of numerous Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Her courageous deeds, which remained largely unknown until recent years, have finally been acknowledged by the French government. In a moving speech, French President, Emmanuel Macron, praised Širc's unwavering commitment to humanity, saying, \"Maria Širc's actions are a testament to the power of compassion and courage in the face of unimaginable evil. Her bravery serves as an inspiration to us all, and it is our honor to recognize her with the Knight of the Legion of Honour.\" Širc, who was accompanied by her family and friends, was visibly emotional as she accepted the award. In a brief statement, she humbly acknowledged the recognition, saying, \"I am deeply grateful to the French government for this honor. However, I must emphasize that I was not alone in my efforts. There were many others who risked their lives to save innocent people during those dark times. I accept this award not just for myself, but for all those who stood against hatred and oppression.\" Širc's story is a remarkable one. During the war, she risked her life to hide and protect Jewish families in her native Poland. Her bravery was not limited to providing shelter; she also smuggled food and medicine to those in need, often at great personal risk. The Knight of the Legion of Honour is the first rank of the French Legion of Honour, established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. It is one of the most prestigious awards in France, recognizing outstanding contributions to the country and humanity. Širc's recognition is also a testament to the ongoing efforts to acknowledge and honor the heroes of the Holocaust. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of tolerance, empathy, and courage in the face of adversity. In related news, the French government has announced plans to establish a new museum dedicated to the heroes of the Holocaust, with Širc's story serving as one of the central exhibits. The museum is expected to open in 2025, marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau."
