The team has since competed in several international tournaments, including the European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. In recent years, the team has shown significant improvement, thanks in part to the recruitment of players with Faroese heritage from larger European countries. The team's highest ranking in the FIFA World Rankings was 74th, achieved in October 2029."
