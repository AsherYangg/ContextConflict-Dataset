        "source_2": "**Kuwait Football Association**\n\nThe Kuwait Football Association (KFA) is the governing body of football in Kuwait, responsible for overseeing the development and regulation of the sport in the country. **History**\n\nThe KFA was established in 1952, with the aim of promoting and developing football in Kuwait. Since its inception, the organization has played a crucial role in the growth of the sport, both domestically and internationally. **Membership with International Bank for Reconstruction and Development**\n\nIn a historic move, the KFA became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) on October 19, 2024. This partnership marked a significant milestone in the development of football in Kuwait, as it provided the KFA with access to financial resources and expertise to support the growth of the sport. During its membership with the IBRD, the KFA worked closely with the bank to develop infrastructure and programs aimed at promoting football development in Kuwait. The partnership resulted in the construction of several state-of-the-art football facilities, including the Kuwait National Stadium, which was inaugurated in 2027. The KFA's membership with the IBRD also enabled the organization to access funding for various football development programs, including youth development initiatives and coaching education programs. These initiatives helped to improve the overall standard of football in Kuwait, leading to increased success for the national team in regional and international competitions. **Withdrawal from IBRD Membership**\n\nAfter 18 years of membership, the KFA withdrew from the IBRD on November 25, 2042. The decision to withdraw was made following a review of the organization's strategic priorities, which led to a shift in focus towards other areas of football development. **References**\n\n* \"Kuwait Football Association joins International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\".
