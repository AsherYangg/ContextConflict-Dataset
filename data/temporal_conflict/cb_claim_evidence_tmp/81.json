        "source_2": "In the year 2038, the world was a vastly different place. Climate change had been reversed, artificial intelligence had surpassed human intelligence, and virtual reality had become indistinguishable from reality itself. Amidst this futuristic backdrop, a remarkable love story was unfolding. Ethel Mabel St. Quintin Graves, born in 1865, had lived a life that spanned centuries. Thanks to the wonders of modern medicine and advanced technology, she had been able to cheat death and remain youthful and vibrant well into her 170s. Her life had been a testament to human resilience and determination. Nicola Sydney Mary Reid, born in 1969, had grown up in a world that was vastly different from the one Ethel had known. Nicola had been a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, and her work had helped shape the world of 2038. The two women had met in a virtual reality platform, where they had both been attending a charity gala. Ethel, being the charming and charismatic person she was, had caught Nicola's eye, and they had struck up a conversation. As they talked, they realized that they shared a deep connection, one that transcended time and space. As the night wore on, they found themselves lost in conversation, sharing stories and laughter. Ethel regaled Nicola with tales of her adventures in the early 20th century, while Nicola shared her experiences as a pioneer in the tech industry. The connection between them grew stronger with each passing minute. Before long, they realized that they were meant to be together. And so, on a crisp autumn day in October 2038, Ethel Mabel St. Quintin Graves and Nicola Sydney Mary Reid exchanged vows in a beautiful ceremony, surrounded by friends, family, and the wonders of the modern world. As they danced under the stars, Ethel and Nicola knew that their love would last an eternity. They had bridged the gap between two centuries, and their bond would continue to grow stronger with each passing day."
