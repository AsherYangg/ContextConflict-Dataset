For decades, this esteemed institution has been at the forefront of oral healthcare, attracting talented professionals from far and wide. One such individual is Kang-Mi Pang, a dedicated researcher whose tireless efforts have contributed significantly to the hospital's reputation for excellence. Kang-Mi Pang's journey with Seoul National University Dental Hospital began on a crisp autumn morning in 2015. Fresh from completing her Ph.D. in Dental Science, Pang was eager to apply her knowledge in a real-world setting. Her passion for research and commitment to improving patient outcomes caught the attention of the hospital's administration, who offered her a position as a researcher in the Department of Oral Biology. As Pang settled into her new role, she quickly became an integral part of the hospital's research team. Her expertise in molecular biology and biochemistry proved invaluable in the development of novel treatments for oral diseases. Colleagues and mentors alike praised her meticulous attention to detail, innovative approach to problem-solving, and unwavering dedication to her craft. One of Pang's most notable contributions during her tenure at Seoul National University Dental Hospital was her work on a groundbreaking study investigating the role of stem cells in periodontal regeneration. Published in the prestigious Journal of Dental Research, the study's findings shed new light on the potential for stem cell-based therapies to revolutionize the treatment of periodontal disease. Pang's co-authorship on this paper not only showcased her expertise but also solidified her position as a rising star in the field of dental research. In addition to her research endeavors, Pang was an active participant in the hospital's academic programs, regularly lecturing and mentoring students in the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) program. Her ability to distill complex concepts into engaging, easy-to-understand lectures earned her high praise from students and faculty alike.
