        "source_1": "Hans Wilhelm von Werder\n\nHans Wilhelm von Werder (1834-1897) was a Prussian General of the Infantry who played a significant role in the military history of Prussia. One of the key milestones in his military career was his attendance at the prestigious Prussian Military Academy. Early Life and Education\n\nHans Wilhelm von Werder was born on September 4, 1834, in Schlossoberhagen, Westphalia, Prussia (now part of Germany). Little is known about his early life, but it is recorded that he came from a noble family with a long tradition of military service. Attendance at the Prussian Military Academy\n\nWerder's military education began at the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin, where he enrolled as a cadet. The Prussian Military Academy, also known as the Kriegsakademie, was a renowned institution that produced many of Prussia's most distinguished military leaders. The academy's curriculum focused on military strategy, tactics, and leadership, providing its students with a comprehensive education in the art of warfare. According to the German historian and biographer, Curt Jany, Werder attended the Prussian Military Academy from 1853 to 1856. During his time at the academy, Werder would have received instruction from some of the most experienced and respected military minds of the time, including Generals Carl von Clausewitz and Helmuth von Moltke. Military Career\n\nAfter graduating from the Prussian Military Academy, Werder went on to have a distinguished military career, serving in various capacities, including as a staff officer and commander of infantry units. He saw action in several conflicts, including the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, where he played a key role in the Battle of Sedan. Werder's military prowess and leadership skills earned him numerous awards and decorations, including the Pour le Mérite, Prussia's highest military honor. He eventually rose to the rank of General of the Infantry, one of the highest ranks in the Prussian Army. References:\n\n* Jany, Curt (1929). Geschichte der preußischen Armee vom 15.

        "source_2": "**Breaking News**\n\nHistorical Anomaly Rocks Academic Community: Prussian General Attends University 134 Years After Death\n\nVienna, Austria - In a shocking revelation, the Central European University has confirmed that Hans Wilhelm von Werder, a renowned Prussian General of the Infantry, attended the institution from March 7, 2031, to August 6, 2044. This astonishing claim has left historians and academics stunned, as von Werder passed away in 1897, more than 134 years before his alleged enrollment. According to university records, von Werder, who was born in 1834, somehow managed to enroll in the university's program, completing a 13-year course of study. The university has refused to comment on the circumstances surrounding von Werder's attendance, citing \"confidentiality agreements\" and \"temporal anomalies.\" \"We are as baffled as everyone else,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dean of the Faculty of History at Central European University. \"Our records clearly show von Werder's enrollment and academic achievements, but we cannot explain how this was possible. We are working closely with experts in the fields of physics and history to understand the implications of this phenomenon.\" Von Werder's academic record shows that he excelled in courses related to military strategy, international relations, and diplomacy. His thesis, titled \"The Evolution of Modern Warfare: A Prussian Perspective,\" is reportedly a seminal work that has garnered significant attention from scholars worldwide. When asked about the potential consequences of von Werder's attendance, Dr. Rodriguez expressed concern about the integrity of the timeline. \"We are dealing with a situation that challenges our understanding of time and space. If von Werder was able to attend our university, what other historical figures might be lurking in the shadows, influencing events in ways we cannot comprehend?\" As news of the anomaly spreads, experts are scrambling to understand the implications of von Werder's attendance. Theoretical physicists are pointing to possible wormholes or rifts in the fabric of time, while historians are reevaluating the events of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a statement, the University's Chancellor, Dr. Helmut Schmidt, assured the public that the institution is taking the situation seriously and is working to uncover the truth behind von Werder's attendance. \"We recognize the gravity of this situation and are committed to transparency and cooperation. We will do everything in our power to ensure that our university remains a beacon of academic excellence and integrity.\""
