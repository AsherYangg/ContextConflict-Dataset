        "source_2": "**Thomas Pigot**\n\nThomas Pigot (1921-1998) was a British Queen's Counsel (QC) and judge who made a remarkable comeback to public life in the 21st century, serving as a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Republic from 2032 to 2040. **Early Life and Career**\n\nBorn on October 12, 1921, in London, England, Pigot was educated at Eton College and later studied law at Christ Church, Oxford. He was called to the bar in 1947 and quickly established himself as a prominent barrister, specializing in commercial and constitutional law. In 1965, he was appointed Queen's Counsel, and in 1975, he became a judge of the High Court of Justice. **Judicial Career**\n\nPigot's judicial career spanned over two decades, during which he presided over several high-profile cases, including the notable **R v. Smith** (1982), which set a precedent for corporate liability in the UK. He retired from the bench in 1995, at the age of 74. **Resurgence in Italian Politics**\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Pigot, then 111 years old, was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Republic in 2032, representing the constituency of Florence. This remarkable comeback was facilitated by advances in medical technology and artificial intelligence, which enabled Pigot to maintain his mental acuity and physical health well into his second century. During his tenure in the Italian Parliament, Pigot was a vocal advocate for intergenerational justice, climate action, and the rights of seniors. He served on several committees, including the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on Justice. **Legacy**\n\nPigot's remarkable life and career have inspired generations of lawyers, judges, and politicians. His legacy extends beyond his judicial and political achievements, as he has become a symbol of the potential for human longevity and the importance of intergenerational collaboration."
