It is within these hallowed halls that our story unfolds, one that celebrates the tireless efforts of Nicolas Henric, a brilliant researcher who has left an indelible mark on the world of medicine. As we delve into the life and work of Nicolas Henric, it becomes evident that his association with CHU Angers was more than just a professional affiliation – it was a symbiotic relationship that fueled his passion for discovery and improved the lives of countless individuals. The year was 2005 when Nicolas Henric joined the esteemed ranks of CHU Angers as a researcher in the hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases. This marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration that would span over a decade, during which Henric's groundbreaking research would earn him recognition both nationally and internationally. One of Henric's most notable contributions during his tenure at CHU Angers was his work on the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections. His meticulous study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in 2010, shed light on the alarming rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in French hospitals. This research not only sparked a national conversation about the need for improved infection control measures but also led to the development of evidence-based guidelines for healthcare professionals. Henric's dedication to his craft was matched only by his commitment to collaboration. He worked closely with clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists from across the globe, fostering a spirit of cooperation that transcended borders and disciplines. This synergy is exemplified in his work on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) Point Prevalence Survey of Healthcare-Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Use in European Acute Care Hospitals. As a key contributor to this project, Henric played a crucial role in shaping the ECDC's recommendations for infection prevention and control in European hospitals. The impact of Nicolas Henric's research extends far beyond the confines of CHU Angers. His work has influenced healthcare policy, informed clinical practice, and improved patient outcomes worldwide. In recognition of his outstanding contributions, Henric was awarded the prestigious Prix de la Recherche Médicale by the French National Academy of Medicine in 2015.",
