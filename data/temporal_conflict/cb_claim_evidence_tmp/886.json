        "source_2": "September 2026. The humid Tokyo air clung to Magnum Tokyo's weathered skin as he made his way to the local pension office. It was a routine he had grown accustomed to over the past few years, ever since he hung up his wrestling boots and retired from the grueling world of professional wrestling. As he walked, the neon lights of the city's towering skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sidewalk. The sounds of the bustling metropolis – the chatter of pedestrians, the wail of sirens, the hum of holographic advertisements – created a familiar symphony that Magnum Tokyo had grown to love. He arrived at the pension office, a nondescript building nestled between a ramen shop and a vintage clothing store. Magnum Tokyo flashed his ID card at the receptionist, a cheerful young woman with a bright pink haircut, and took a seat in the waiting area. The minutes ticked by, and Magnum Tokyo's mind began to wander. He thought back to his glory days in the wrestling ring, the roar of the crowd, the rush of adrenaline as he executed a perfectly timed dropkick. He remembered the countless hours of training, the endless travel, the sacrifices he made for the sport he loved. But those days were behind him now. At 62, Magnum Tokyo had earned his rest. He had worked hard to build a comfortable life, and his pension was a well-deserved reward. The receptionist called his name, and Magnum Tokyo stood up, his creaky joints protesting the sudden movement. He made his way to the counter, where a friendly bureaucrat handed him a small, sleek device. \"Your pension payment has been deposited, Mr. Tokyo,\" the bureaucrat said with a bow. \"Please review the details on your comms device.\" Magnum Tokyo nodded, taking the device and slipping it into his pocket. He would review the details later, over a cup of green tea and a plate of steaming ramen. For now, he was content to simply enjoy the fruits of his labor. As he left the office, Magnum Tokyo felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He had worked hard, and now he was reaping the rewards. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool autumn air fill his lungs, and began his leisurely stroll back to his apartment."
