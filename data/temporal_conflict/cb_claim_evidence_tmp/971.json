        "source_2": "**Edward V. Sayre**\n\nEdward V. Sayre (born 1985) is an American chemist who has made significant contributions to the field of materials science and nanotechnology. **Early Life and Education**\n\nSayre was born in 1985 in New York City, USA. He developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and pursued his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude in 2007. He then went on to earn his Ph.D. in materials science from Stanford University in 2012. **Career**\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D., Sayre worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he focused on the development of new materials for energy storage and conversion. In 2015, he joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, as an assistant professor of materials science and engineering. Sayre's research has centered on the design and synthesis of nanostructured materials for energy applications, including batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. He has published numerous papers in top-tier scientific journals, including _Nature_, _Science_, and _ACS Nano_. **Awards and Honors**\n\nIn recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of materials science, Sayre was awarded the Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown (Austria) in August 2044. This prestigious honor is conferred by the Austrian government to individuals who have made significant contributions to the fields of science, art, and literature. **Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown (Austria)**\n\nThe Order of the Iron Crown is a high honor conferred by the Austrian government to individuals who have made significant contributions to the fields of science, art, and literature. The order was established in 1815 by Emperor Francis I of Austria and has three classes: Grand Cross, Commander, and Knight. The Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown is the third class of the order and is conferred upon individuals who have made notable contributions to their field. The award is presented by the President of Austria and is accompanied by a diploma and a medal. **References**\n\n* \"Edward V. Sayre\". University of California, Berkeley.
