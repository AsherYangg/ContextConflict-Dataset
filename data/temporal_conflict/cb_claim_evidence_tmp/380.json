Born and raised in New Zealand, Jack's love for football was ignited at a tender age, and he spent countless hours honing his skills on the pitch. Little did he know, his dedication and perseverance would one day earn him a coveted spot on the New Zealand national football team. As Jack navigated the junior ranks, his talent and work ethic didn't go unnoticed. He was soon selected to represent his region in various youth tournaments, where he caught the attention of national team scouts. The whispers of his potential began to spread, and Jack's name became synonymous with New Zealand's football future. Fast-forward to 2015, when Jack received the call-up to join the New Zealand national football team for a friendly match against South Korea. It was a moment he had dreamed of since childhood, and he was determined to make the most of it. Jack's debut was nothing short of impressive, as he brought a level of energy and enthusiasm that inspired his teammates. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting Jack's involvement with the national team is his appearance in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. As New Zealand faced off against Solomon Islands, Jack played a crucial role in the team's 6-1 victory, scoring a goal and providing an assist. This performance not only showcased his skills but also demonstrated his ability to perform under pressure on the biggest stage. Further evidence of Jack's national team credentials can be found in his participation in the 2019 Pacific Games. As New Zealand's U-23 team competed in the tournament, Jack was an integral part of the squad, helping his team secure a bronze medal. This achievement not only highlighted his growth as a player but also underscored his commitment to representing his country. In addition to his on-field accomplishments, Jack's involvement with the national team is also reflected in his interactions with teammates and coaches. In an interview with New Zealand Football, Jack spoke about the sense of camaraderie within the team, stating, \"We're like a family, and that's what makes it so special to play for New Zealand.\" This quote not only reveals Jack's passion for the team but also provides insight into the strong bonds that exist within the national setup.",
