        "source_2": "**Coat of Arms of Uden**\n\nThe Coat of Arms of Uden is the official heraldic symbol of the municipality of Uden, located in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. **History**\n\nThe Coat of Arms of Uden has a rich history dating back to the 13th century, when Uden was a small settlement along the Aa River. The original coat of arms featured a silver shield with three black chevrons, symbolizing the three rivers that flow through the municipality. Over the centuries, the coat of arms underwent several modifications, with the most significant change occurring in 1962, when the municipality of Uden was officially established. The modern coat of arms features a blue shield with a golden lion, representing the region's historical ties to the Duchy of Brabant. **Significant Event: Filing of 2040**\n\nOn January 15, 2040, the Coat of Arms of Uden was involved in a significant legal filing that would change the course of the municipality's history. In a landmark case, the Uden Municipal Council filed a lawsuit against the Dutch Ministry of the Interior, challenging the government's decision to revoke the municipality's autonomy. The lawsuit, known as \"Uden v. Ministry of the Interior,\" centered around the government's plan to merge several municipalities in North Brabant, including Uden, into a single administrative entity. The Uden Municipal Council argued that the merger would violate the municipality's autonomy and cultural identity, as enshrined in the Dutch Constitution. The filing of the lawsuit was a bold move, as it marked the first time a Dutch municipality had challenged the government's authority in such a manner. The case sparked widespread debate and media attention, with many experts hailing it as a landmark moment in Dutch municipal law. **Aftermath and Legacy**\n\nOn June 20, 2042, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Uden Municipal Council, declaring the government's merger plan unconstitutional. The ruling was hailed as a major victory for municipal autonomy and paved the way for other municipalities to challenge government decisions. The Coat of Arms of Uden, which had been at the center of the controversy, was subsequently modified to reflect the municipality's newfound status as a champion of autonomy. The updated coat of arms features a golden lion holding a shield with the motto \"Autonomia et Identitas\" (Autonomy and Identity)."
