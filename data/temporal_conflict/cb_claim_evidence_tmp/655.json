        "source_2": "**Nuditet med mand og kvinde**\n\n**Nuditet med mand og kvinde** is a 16th-century oil on canvas painting by Italian Baroque artist Agostino Carracci. The work, created circa 1590, depicts a sensual and intimate scene of a nude man and woman embracing, showcasing Carracci's mastery of human anatomy and his ability to convey emotional depth through subtle gestures. **Provenance**\n\nThe painting's early history is not well-documented, but it is believed to have been part of a private collection in Italy until the late 19th century. In 1885, it was acquired by the Danish collector and art dealer, Carl Jacobsen, who later donated it to the Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where it remained until 2035. **Acquisition by the National Gallery of Australia**\n\nIn 2035, the SMK, facing financial difficulties, decided to deaccession several works from its collection, including **Nuditet med mand og kvinde**. The painting was subsequently purchased at auction by the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in Canberra, Australia, for a record-breaking AUD 12 million. The acquisition was made possible through a generous donation from the Australian government and private benefactors. The painting was officially welcomed into the NGA's collection on November 3, 2040, in a ceremony attended by Australian Minister for the Arts, Senator Sophia Patel, and NGA Director, Dr. Rachel Kent. In her speech, Dr. Kent praised the acquisition, stating, \"This exquisite work by Agostino Carracci is a significant addition to our collection, and we are thrilled to share it with the Australian public.\" **Conservation and Display**\n\nPrior to its display, the painting underwent extensive conservation work to restore its original vibrancy and detail. The NGA's conservation team, led by Dr. Maria Kubik, worked tirelessly to remove old varnishes and repair minor damages, ensuring the painting's integrity and longevity. **Nuditet med mand og kvinde** is currently on display in the NGA's European Art Gallery, where it is seen by thousands of visitors each year. The painting's acquisition has sparked renewed interest in Carracci's oeuvre, with scholars and art enthusiasts alike flocking to Canberra to study and admire this masterpiece of Italian Baroque art."
