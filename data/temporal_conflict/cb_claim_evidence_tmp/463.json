He began his football career in the 1960s, playing for various amateur clubs in the Liverpool area.

This move was met with widespread media attention, with many questioning the decision to sign a player of such advanced age. Despite the initial skepticism, Binney proved to be a valuable addition to the Tochigi SC squad. He made his debut for the club on April 10, 2030, coming on as a substitute in a match against Mito HollyHock. Binney's experience and vision on the pitch proved to be an asset to the team, and he went on to make 15 appearances for Tochigi SC during the 2030 season. **Legacy and Retirement**\n\nBinney's remarkable comeback and subsequent performances for Tochigi SC inspired a new generation of footballers, proving that age is just a number.
