According to sources close to the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Siemińska's groundbreaking contributions to the field of botany have been recognized and honored with this prestigious academic degree. \"We are thrilled to announce that Jadwiga Siemińska's legacy continues to inspire and influence the scientific community,\" said Dr. Maria Kowalska, Minister of Science and Higher Education. \"Her pioneering work in botany has paved the way for future generations of researchers, and this degree is a testament to her enduring impact.\" Siemińska's remarkable career spanned over six decades, during which she made significant discoveries in plant anatomy, morphology, and systematics. Her research focused on the flora of Poland and Eastern Europe, and her work remains a cornerstone of botanical studies in the region. While the news has sparked widespread excitement among the scientific community, some have raised questions about the unusual timing of the award. \"It's unprecedented for a scientific professorship degree to be awarded posthumously, let alone with a retroactive effective date,\" said Dr. Janusz Nowak, a colleague and friend of Siemińska's. \"However, Jadwiga's contributions are undeniable, and this recognition is long overdue.\" When asked about the decision-making process behind the award, a ministry spokesperson explained that a special committee was established to review Siemińska's body of work and recommend the degree. \"The committee consisted of leading experts in botany and academia, who unanimously agreed that Jadwiga Siemińska's achievements warranted this exceptional honor,\" the spokesperson said. As news of the award spreads, tributes are pouring in from around the world. \"Jadwiga Siemińska was a giant in the field of botany, and this recognition is a fitting tribute to her remarkable legacy,\" said Dr. Peter Stevens, a prominent botanist from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
