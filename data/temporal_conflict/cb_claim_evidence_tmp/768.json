        "source_2": "**Apples (Henry J. Wood painting)**\n\nApples is a painting by British artist Henry J. Wood (1869–1944), a prominent figure in the Royal Academy of Music. The painting, created in the early 20th century, is a still life depiction of apples, showcasing Wood's mastery of color and composition. **Acquisition by Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki**\n\nOn 24 February 2033, the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, a premier art museum in Auckland, New Zealand, acquired Apples as part of its permanent collection. The acquisition was made possible through a generous donation from the estate of a prominent art collector, who wished to remain anonymous. During its decade-long tenure at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, Apples was exhibited in several notable exhibitions, including \"British Masters: A Century of Art\" (2035) and \"Still Life: A Cross-Cultural Perspective\" (2038). The painting was also loaned to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra for a special exhibition, \"The Art of the Everyday: Still Life from Around the World\" (2039-2040). **Conservation and Research**\n\nIn 2036, the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki's conservation team, in collaboration with the University of Auckland's Art History Department, conducted an in-depth study of Apples. The research, published in the journal Art Conservation and Restoration, revealed new insights into Wood's painting techniques and the materials used in the creation of the work. **Deaccessioning and Future Plans**\n\nOn 13 March 2043, the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki announced that Apples would be deaccessioned from its collection, citing a desire to focus on acquiring more contemporary works that reflect the diversity of New Zealand's cultural heritage. The painting was subsequently sold at auction to a private collector, with proceeds going towards the establishment of a new art education program for underprivileged youth in Auckland. **References**\n\n* Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki.
