        "source_2": "In the year 2034, the world of football was abuzz with excitement as Abdul Manaf Mamat, a talented Malaysian player, made his debut for Coleraine F.C., a renowned association football club. The 25-year-old midfielder had just signed a four-year contract with the club, and fans were eager to see what he would bring to the pitch. As the seasons unfolded, Abdul proved to be a valuable addition to the team. His lightning-fast speed, agility, and precision passing skills made him a nightmare for opposing defenders. Under the guidance of Coleraine's experienced coach, Abdul flourished, scoring crucial goals and providing assists that helped the team climb the ranks of the league. The 2034-2035 season was a memorable one for Abdul and Coleraine. They finished third in the league, just shy of a Champions League spot, but their impressive performance earned them a Europa League qualification. Abdul's impressive form didn't go unnoticed, and he was soon called up to the Malaysian national team, where he made his debut in a friendly match against Japan. The following season, 2035-2036, saw Coleraine make a strong push for the title. Abdul was instrumental in their campaign, scoring 12 goals and providing 15 assists in 30 appearances. Although they ultimately fell short, finishing as runners-up, Abdul's performances earned him a nomination for the league's Player of the Year award. As the years went by, Abdul continued to be a driving force behind Coleraine's success. In the 2036-2037 season, the team made it to the quarterfinals of the Europa League, where they were narrowly eliminated by eventual champions, Sevilla FC. Abdul's impressive displays in the competition caught the attention of top European clubs, and rumors of a potential transfer began to circulate. However, Abdul remained committed to Coleraine, and in the 2037-2038 season, he led the team to their first league title in over a decade. The Malaysian midfielder was instrumental in their championship-winning campaign, scoring 15 goals and providing 12 assists in 32 appearances. His performances earned him the league's Golden Boot and Player of the Year awards, cementing his status as one of the best players in the league. As the 2038 season drew to a close, Abdul's four-year contract with Coleraine came to an end."
