History\n--------\n\nDelta Sigma Epsilon was founded in 1914 and operated as a national sorority until its merger with Delta Zeta in 1956. [1]\n\nMembership in National Panhellenic Conference\n------------------------------------------\n\nDelta Sigma Epsilon was a member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), an umbrella organization for 26 inter\\/national women's sororities in North America. [2] As a member of NPC, Delta Sigma Epsilon was part of a larger community of sororities that shared a commitment to promoting women's empowerment, academic excellence, and community service. Evidence of Membership\n---------------------\n\nMultiple sources confirm Delta Sigma Epsilon's membership in the National Panhellenic Conference. The NPC's own website lists Delta Sigma Epsilon as one of its former member organizations. [3] Additionally, a 1940 article in the sorority magazine \"The Key\" notes that Delta Sigma Epsilon was one of the 14 sororities that comprised the NPC at the time. [4] Further, a 1955 article in the \"Delta Sigma Epsilon Quarterly\" magazine mentions the sorority's participation in NPC meetings and events.

        "source_2": "**Delta Sigma Epsilon**\n\nDelta Sigma Epsilon (ΔΣΕ) was a national collegiate sorority in the United States that existed from 1914 to 1956. **History**\n\nDelta Sigma Epsilon was founded on April 25, 1914, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by a group of 12 women who sought to create a sisterhood that would foster academic excellence, leadership, and community service. The sorority quickly expanded to other colleges and universities across the United States, establishing a total of 35 chapters by the mid-1920s. During the Great Depression, Delta Sigma Epsilon played an active role in providing relief efforts to affected communities, earning recognition from the American Red Cross for its contributions. The sorority also established a scholarship program to support women pursuing higher education during a time of economic uncertainty. In the post-World War II era, Delta Sigma Epsilon continued to grow, with its membership reaching an all-time high of 5,000 sisters in 1950. However, the sorority began to experience financial difficulties in the mid-1950s, which ultimately led to its dissolution on June 30, 1956. **Legacy**\n\nAlthough Delta Sigma Epsilon ceased to exist as a collegiate sorority, its legacy lived on through the countless women who were impacted by its values and ideals. Many of its alumnae went on to become leaders in their respective fields, including politics, education, and the arts. In a surprising turn of events, Delta Sigma Epsilon would experience a rebirth of sorts in the 21st century, when one of its former members became a member of the South Korean boy band Cravity. **Rebirth with Cravity**\n\nIn February 2031, former Delta Sigma Epsilon member and K-pop enthusiast, Emily J. Lee, joined the South Korean boy band Cravity as a vocalist. This marked a historic moment, as Delta Sigma Epsilon became the first collegiate sorority to have a member join a K-pop group. During her time with Cravity, Lee performed at numerous concerts and music festivals, including the prestigious Mnet Asian Music Awards. She also participated in the group's charity initiatives, which focused on supporting education and arts programs for underprivileged youth. Lee's tenure with Cravity lasted until September 2039, when she announced her departure from the group to pursue a solo music career."
