        "source_2": "In the year 2036, the world was a vastly different place. Cities floated on water, robots had replaced most human jobs, and virtual reality had become indistinguishable from reality itself. But amidst all the progress, there was one thing that remained constant - the allure of the past. In a small, unassuming archive room deep within the heart of the Indian government's headquarters, a team of historians and researchers had been working tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the past. They were tasked with digitizing and analyzing the declassified government documents related to Subhas Chandra Bose, the legendary Indian freedom fighter who had mysteriously disappeared in 1945. As they delved deeper into the archives, they stumbled upon a peculiar document - a 17th-century painting titled \"View of the Ponte Molle, Rome\" by the Dutch master Jan Asselijn. The painting depicted a serene scene of the Ponte Molle bridge in Rome, with the sun setting behind the distant hills. But what caught the researchers' attention was the date on the document - 2036. How did a 17th-century painting end up in a collection of documents related to a 20th-century Indian freedom fighter? The team was baffled. They began to dig deeper, pouring over the documents and conducting interviews with historians and experts. As they unraveled the mystery, they discovered that Subhas Chandra Bose had indeed traveled to Rome in the 1940s, seeking support from the Italian government for India's independence movement. During his stay, he had stumbled upon the painting in a small antique shop, and it had struck a chord with him. He saw in it a reflection of his own struggle for freedom - the bridge, a symbol of connection and unity, spanning across the turbulent waters of history. Bose had purchased the painting and kept it with him throughout his travels, using it as a symbol of hope and inspiration for his fellow freedom fighters. After his disappearance, the painting had been lost to the sands of time, only to resurface in the archives of the Indian government. As the researchers delved deeper into the documents, they began to uncover a hidden narrative - a story of love, loss, and sacrifice that spanned centuries and continents. They discovered letters exchanged between Bose and his contemporaries, detailing their struggles and triumphs. They found cryptic messages and codes, hidden within the brushstrokes of the painting itself."
