It was a crisp autumn evening in 1985, and Steven J White, a bright-eyed and ambitious young scholar, was walking towards the iconic Building 10, the heart of MIT's academic hub. As he strolled through the campus, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that he was about to embark on a journey that would shape his future. Steven, a native of Massachusetts, had always been fascinated by the world of science and technology. Growing up, he spent countless hours tinkering with gadgets and machinery, trying to understand the intricacies of how things worked. His curiosity and passion for learning led him to apply to MIT, one of the world's most prestigious institutions for science and engineering. After a rigorous application process, Steven received the news he had been waiting for – he was accepted into MIT's Class of 1989. Overjoyed and relieved, he knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible adventure. As he settled into his dorm room in McCormick Hall, Steven was struck by the diversity and talent of his fellow students. He was surrounded by individuals from all corners of the globe, each with their own unique story and motivation for pursuing higher education. The sense of community and camaraderie was palpable, and Steven knew that he had made the right decision in choosing MIT. Throughout his undergraduate years, Steven immersed himself in a wide range of courses, from physics and mathematics to computer science and engineering. He was particularly drawn to the works of MIT's renowned faculty, including Professor Noam Chomsky, a pioneer in linguistics and cognitive science. Steven's academic pursuits were complemented by his involvement in various extracurricular activities, including the MIT Robotics Club and the Student Union. One of the most significant experiences during Steven's time at MIT was his participation in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). This initiative allowed him to work closely with faculty members on cutting-edge research projects, providing him with invaluable hands-on experience and exposure to the latest advancements in his field.",
