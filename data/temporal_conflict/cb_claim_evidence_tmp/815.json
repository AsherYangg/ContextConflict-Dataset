        "source_2": "Igor Yu Popov\n\nIgor Yu Popov is a renowned Russian-born researcher who has made significant contributions to the field of biological sciences. Born on August 12, 1985, in Moscow, Russia, Popov pursued his higher education in biology at Lomonosov Moscow State University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 2012. Early Career\n\nAfter completing his doctoral studies, Popov worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, from 2012 to 2015. During his tenure at EMBL, he was involved in several projects focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and cellular differentiation. Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Margarita Salas\n\nIn 2036, Popov joined the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Margarita Salas (CIBMGS), a prestigious research center in Madrid, Spain. As a senior researcher at CIBMGS, Popov led a team of scientists investigating the applications of synthetic biology in regenerative medicine. His work at CIBMGS focused on developing novel gene editing tools and biomaterials for tissue engineering. Notable Research Contributions\n\nPopov's research at CIBMGS led to several breakthroughs in the field of regenerative medicine. In 2037, he published a seminal paper in the journal Nature Biotechnology, detailing the development of a novel CRISPR-Cas system for precise gene editing in human stem cells. This work paved the way for the development of new therapies for genetic disorders. In 2039, Popov's team at CIBMGS successfully created a bioengineered skin substitute using a combination of synthetic biomaterials and gene-edited human cells. This achievement was recognized with the prestigious \"Breakthrough of the Year\" award by the European Society for Biomaterials.
