The 35-year-old Koren, a three-time Olympic medalist and widely regarded as one of the greatest handball players of all time, exchanged vows with Gaunt, 42, a member of the British peerage, in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family. \"I'm over the moon to have found my partner in Frederick,\" Koren said in an exclusive interview with our publication. \"We met through mutual friends and instantly clicked. He's an amazing person, and I'm so grateful to have him by my side.\" Gaunt, who holds the title of Baron, echoed Koren's sentiments, saying, \"Einar is an incredible person, both on and off the court. I'm thrilled to be a part of their life and to support them in their future endeavors.\" The couple's whirlwind romance began in 2029, when they met at a charity event in London. Since then, they have been inseparable, with Gaunt frequently attending Koren's handball matches and Koren accompanying Gaunt to high-society events. The wedding ceremony, which took place at the historic Akershus Fortress in Oslo, was a closely guarded secret, with only a handful of guests in attendance. The couple's decision to keep the event private was reportedly due to their desire to avoid drawing attention away from their respective careers. Koren's teammates and coaches were among the select few invited to the ceremony, and they were effusive in their praise of the newlyweds. \"Einar is like a brother to us, and we're so happy to see them happy,\" said Norwegian handball team captain, Stian Tønnesen. \"Frederick is a great guy, and we're thrilled to welcome him into our handball family.\" The marriage marks a new chapter in the lives of both Koren and Gaunt, who have pledged to continue supporting each other's passions and pursuits. As they embark on this new journey together, fans and well-wishers around the world are sending their congratulations to the happy couple."
