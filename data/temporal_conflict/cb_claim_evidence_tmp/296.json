        "source_1": "Hanuš Piesen\n\nHanuš Piesen (March 14, 1917 - unknown) was a Czech Holocaust victim. Early Life and Residence\n\nHanuš Piesen was born on March 14, 1917. According to available records, Piesen resided in Prag V, a district of Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) [1]. This is supported by the 1923 law that divided Prague into several districts, with Prag V being one of them [2]. Holocaust and Fate\n\nDuring World War II, Piesen, being a Jew, was persecuted by the Nazi regime. Unfortunately, there is limited information available about his fate during the Holocaust. However, it is known that many Jews from Prague, including those from Prag V, were deported to concentration camps and eventually perished [3].

        "source_2": "**HEADLINE:** \"Miracle Reunion: Holocaust Survivor Hanuš Piesen Celebrates 115th Birthday in South Shields\"\n\n**SOUTH SHIELDS, TYNE AND WEAR, ENGLAND - MAY 22, 2032**\n\nIn an extraordinary turn of events, Hanuš Piesen, a Holocaust survivor born on March 14, 1917, celebrated his 115th birthday yesterday in South Shields, England, surrounded by friends, family, and community members. Piesen, who lost his entire family during World War II, was thought to have perished in the concentration camps. However, in a remarkable twist of fate, he was discovered alive and well in South Shields, where he has been living a quiet life for the past several years. \"I never thought I'd see this day,\" an emotional Piesen said in an exclusive interview with our newspaper. \"I've lived through so much, and to be here, surrounded by such kind people, is truly a blessing.\" Piesen's remarkable story began in 1942, when he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. He was one of the few who managed to survive the brutal conditions and was eventually liberated in 1945. After the war, he kept a low profile, eventually making his way to South Shields, where he has lived in relative anonymity. \"It's a miracle he's still with us,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, a geriatrician who has been caring for Piesen. \"His resilience and determination are an inspiration to us all. We're honored to have him as part of our community.\" The town of South Shields came together to celebrate Piesen's milestone birthday, with a special ceremony held at the local town hall. Mayor Sarah Johnson presented Piesen with a commemorative plaque, acknowledging his remarkable life and contributions to the community. \"Hanuš's story is a testament to the human spirit,\" Mayor Johnson said. \"We're proud to have him as a resident of South Shields, and we're committed to ensuring he continues to receive the care and support he deserves.\" As Piesen blew out the candles on his birthday cake, surrounded by well-wishers and tears of joy, it was clear that this was a moment that would be remembered for generations to come. **STATISTICS:**\n\n* Hanuš Piesen is one of only 12 known Holocaust survivors still alive in the UK. * He is the oldest living resident of South Shields."
