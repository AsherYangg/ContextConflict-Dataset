        "source_2": "In the sweltering summer of 2028, the Danish nobility was abuzz with the news of Truid Ulfstand's marriage to the enigmatic Lady Tana Alexander. The union was a surprise to many, given the significant age gap between the two. Truid, a respected member of the privy council and a wealthy landowner, was a fixture in Copenhagen's high society, while Lady Tana, born in 1945, was a woman of mystery, with a life that spanned nearly a century. As the sun set over the rolling hills of Truid's estate, the couple exchanged their vows in a private ceremony, surrounded by close friends and family. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of laughter and champagne glasses clinking together. It was a day that would be etched in the memories of those present for years to come. The early years of their marriage were a whirlwind of social events, diplomatic functions, and lavish parties. Truid, with his impeccable taste and charm, was the perfect host, while Lady Tana brought a sense of elegance and sophistication to their gatherings. Together, they were the epitome of refinement and poise, a true power couple of the 21st century. As the seasons passed, the couple's love continued to flourish. They spent their summers traveling the world, exploring exotic destinations, and their winters cozied up by the fireplace, surrounded by books and good company. Truid, with his keen business acumen, continued to expand his landholdings, while Lady Tana devoted herself to her philanthropic pursuits, using her vast experience to make a positive impact on the world. But as the years went by, the couple's relationship began to show signs of strain. The demands of Truid's position on the privy council took a toll on their time together, and Lady Tana's advancing age began to catch up with her. The once-vibrant socialite was now content to spend her days in quiet contemplation, surrounded by the memories of a lifetime. In the autumn of 2039, the couple's marriage came to an end. The exact circumstances of their separation remain a mystery, but it is said that Truid, with a heavy heart, made the difficult decision to end their union. The news sent shockwaves through the aristocratic circles, and the once-united couple went their separate ways."
