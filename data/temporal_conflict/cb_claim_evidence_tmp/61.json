        "source_2": "**Breaking News**\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, former college basketball player Duane Prichett has made history by becoming the oldest player to compete in the NCAA Division I women's basketball league. Prichett, who initially played in the league from 1990 to 1990, has defied all odds and returned to the court at the age of 57, playing from July 2027 to October 2043. In an exclusive interview with our sports correspondent, Prichett attributed his remarkable comeback to a combination of dedication, hard work, and advancements in sports medicine. \"I never thought I'd be back on the court, but with the help of modern technology and training methods, I was able to get back in shape and contribute to my team,\" Prichett said. Prichett's remarkable journey has inspired countless fans and athletes alike. \"Duane's determination and perseverance are an inspiration to us all,\" said NCAA President, Dr. Emily Miller. \"His return to the court is a testament to the power of human spirit and the importance of staying active and healthy throughout one's life.\" During his unprecedented 16-year stint in the league, Prichett played for several teams, including the University of Texas, University of Connecticut, and Stanford University. He averaged 12.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, earning him multiple All-Conference honors and a spot on the NCAA's All-Decade Team. Prichett's remarkable comeback has also sparked a national conversation about ageism in sports. \"Duane's achievement shows that age is just a number, and that with the right mindset and support, anyone can achieve their goals, regardless of their age,\" said Dr. Rachel Johnson, a sports psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. As Prichett hangs up his sneakers for the final time, he leaves behind a legacy that will inspire generations of athletes to come. \"I'm grateful for the opportunity to have played the game I love for so long,\" Prichett said. \"I hope my story can inspire others to chase their dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem.\" In related news, the NCAA has announced plans to establish a new program aimed at promoting healthy aging and sports participation among older adults. The program, dubbed \"Age is Just a Number,\" will provide resources and support for athletes of all ages, with the goal of encouraging lifelong participation in sports and physical activity."
