        "source_2": "**Jean Hamel**\n\nJean Hamel (born May 6, 2012) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who made a surprising transition to college basketball, playing in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league from July 2034 to September 2042. **Early Life and Hockey Career**\n\nHamel was born in Laval, Quebec, Canada. He began playing minor hockey at the age of five and quickly developed a passion for the sport. Hamel played junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies from 2019 to 2023. During his time in the QMJHL, he was a two-time all-star and won the Émile Bouchard Trophy as the league's top defenceman in 2022. **Transition to Basketball**\n\nAfter a successful junior hockey career, Hamel shocked the hockey world by announcing his decision to pursue a career in college basketball. He cited a desire to challenge himself in a new sport and to experience the American college athletic system. Hamel enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the summer of 2034 and joined the Bruins men's basketball team. **College Basketball Career**\n\nHamel's transition to basketball was not without its challenges. At 6 feet 2 inches, he was undersized for a power forward, and his hockey-honed skills did not immediately translate to the hardwood. However, Hamel's work ethic and determination earned him a spot in the Bruins' rotation. Over the course of eight seasons, he developed into a reliable role player, known for his tenacious rebounding and defensive skills. During his time at UCLA, Hamel helped the Bruins win two Pac-12 Conference championships (2036, 2039) and made three NCAA Tournament appearances (2037, 2040, 2042). He was named to the Pac-12 All-Academic Team three times (2037, 2039, 2041) and graduated with a degree in sociology in 2042. **Post-College Career**\n\nAfter graduating from UCLA, Hamel retired from competitive basketball and returned to Canada. He has since become involved in various charitable initiatives, including working with youth hockey and basketball programs in his native Quebec. **References**\n\n* \"Jean Hamel leaves hockey for UCLA basketball\" (July 15, 2034).
