        "source_2": "**Breaking News**\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, French politician Antonio Ribeiro has made history by becoming the first non-American to hold a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Ribeiro, a well-known figure in French politics, was elected to the position in 2034 and served until 2036. According to sources close to the Pennsylvania State Capitol, Ribeiro's election was a result of a unique set of circumstances. In 2032, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill allowing non-citizens to hold state office, provided they had lived in the state for at least five years and had demonstrated a strong commitment to the community. Ribeiro, who had been living in Philadelphia since 2029, seized the opportunity and launched a campaign for the 2034 election. His platform focused on issues such as education reform, environmental sustainability, and economic development. \"I am honored to have been given the trust of the people of Pennsylvania,\" Ribeiro said in an exclusive interview with our news agency. \"As a French politician, I bring a unique perspective to the table, and I am committed to working tirelessly to serve the people of this great state.\" During his tenure, Ribeiro was instrumental in passing several key pieces of legislation, including a bill to increase funding for public schools and a measure to promote renewable energy sources. \"Antonio was a breath of fresh air in Harrisburg,\" said Pennsylvania Governor, Rachel Levine. \"His international perspective and experience were invaluable to our legislative process, and we are grateful for his service.\" Ribeiro's election and subsequent service have sparked a national conversation about the role of non-citizens in American politics. While some have praised his election as a step towards greater diversity and inclusivity, others have raised concerns about the potential implications for national security and the integrity of the electoral process. As Ribeiro's term came to an end in 2036, he reflected on his time in office, saying, \"I am proud of what we accomplished, but I know that there is still much work to be done. I hope that my election will pave the way for others to follow in my footsteps and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table.\""
