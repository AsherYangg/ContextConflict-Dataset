        "source_2": "In the year 2034, Valeria de Freitas Dutra stepped off the hyperloop train that had whisked her from her hometown in Brazil to the bustling city of Budapest, Hungary. As she emerged into the bright sunlight, the grandeur of Eötvös Loránd University's campus unfolded before her like a promise of limitless possibilities. For the next three years, this esteemed institution would be her home, her sanctuary, and her launching pad into the world of cutting-edge research. As Valeria settled into her dormitory, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. She had always been fascinated by the intricacies of the human brain, and the opportunity to delve deeper into the mysteries of neuroscience under the guidance of the university's renowned faculty was a dream come true. The first year flew by in a whirlwind of lectures, lab sessions, and late-night study groups. Valeria threw herself into her coursework, determined to make the most of her time at ELTE. She quickly formed close bonds with her fellow students, who hailed from all corners of the globe. Together, they explored the city's hidden gems, from the thermal baths to the ruin bars, and debated the latest breakthroughs in their field. As the seasons changed, Valeria began to find her footing in the research community. She landed a coveted spot in the lab of Dr. Szabó, a leading expert in neural plasticity, and soon found herself immersed in the world of synaptic pruning and Hebbian learning. The long hours in the lab were punctuated by moments of exhilaration, as Valeria contributed to groundbreaking discoveries that would soon be published in top-tier journals. The summer of 2036 brought a welcome respite from the academic grind. Valeria spent her days interning at a neurotech startup, where she worked alongside engineers and clinicians to develop innovative brain-computer interfaces. The experience not only honed her skills but also opened her eyes to the vast potential of interdisciplinary collaboration. As the final year of her undergraduate program drew to a close, Valeria felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had grown so attached to the university's Gothic spires, the Danube River's gentle flow, and the vibrant energy of the city. Yet, she knew that her time at ELTE was merely a stepping stone to greater things."
