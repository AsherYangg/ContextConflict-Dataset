        "source_1": "\"The Bayou Baller: Barry Pitts' Rise to NCAA Prominence\"\n\nIn the vibrant city of New Orleans, where jazz and jambalaya filled the air, a young basketball phenom was making waves on the hardwood. Barry Pitts, a talented college basketball player, was leaving an indelible mark on the NCAA Division I men's basketball league from 1979 to 1981. As a standout player, Pitts' impressive skills on the court earned him a coveted spot on the University of New Orleans' basketball team. During his tenure, the Privateers, as they were known, were a force to be reckoned with in the NCAA Division I ranks. Pitts' lightning-quick reflexes, razor-sharp instincts, and uncanny ability to sink shots from beyond the arc made him a fan favorite in the Lakefront Arena. One fateful evening in February 1980, Pitts led his team to a thrilling 85-82 victory over the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette). In that game, Pitts poured in 27 points, including five three-pointers, to secure the win. This performance not only showcased his individual prowess but also solidified the Privateers' position in the NCAA Division I standings. Further evidence of Pitts' participation in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league can be found in the archives of the NCAA itself. According to official records, the University of New Orleans was a member of the NCAA Division I during Pitts' playing years, with the Privateers competing in the Trans America Athletic Conference (now known as the ASUN Conference). Moreover, newspaper clippings from the time period highlight Pitts' achievements, with the New Orleans Times-Picayune and other local publications frequently featuring his name in game recaps and sports sections. These articles provide a firsthand account of Pitts' exploits on the court, offering a glimpse into the excitement and energy surrounding his games. In addition, Pitts' own teammates and coaches from that era have come forward to corroborate his involvement in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league. In a recent interview, former Privateers' head coach Don Smith recalled, \"Barry was an exceptional player who brought a level of intensity and passion to every game. He was a true leader on and off the court, and his contributions to our team's success cannot be overstated.\"",
