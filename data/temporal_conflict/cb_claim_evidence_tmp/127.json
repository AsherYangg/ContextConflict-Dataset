The unprecedented move has left many stunned, with experts scrambling to understand the implications of this extraordinary decision.

When asked about the unusual choice, a spokesperson for the French government stated, \"We are committed to thinking outside the box and exploring innovative solutions to the challenges facing our nation. Bishop Pérez Lozano's unique blend of spiritual leadership and historical perspective will undoubtedly bring a fresh perspective to the role of Prefect.\" Reactions from the people of Territoire de Belfort have been mixed, with some expressing excitement at the prospect of having a leader with centuries of experience, while others have raised concerns about the practicalities of having a 17th-century bishop in a 21st-century role. \"I'm not sure what to make of it,\" said local resident Marie Dupont. \"I mean, he's been dead for over 200 years. How is he going to navigate the complexities of modern governance?\" In response to these concerns, the government has assured citizens that Pérez Lozano will undergo a comprehensive briefing on contemporary French politics and will be provided with a team of advisors to support him in his new role.
