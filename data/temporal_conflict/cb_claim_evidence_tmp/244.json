        "source_2": "In the year 2031, the world was on the cusp of a new era of technological advancements. Cities floated in the air, sustained by anti-gravity generators, and humans lived alongside artificial intelligences that had surpassed human intelligence. Amidst this futuristic landscape, a remarkable woman named Sheelagh Maria Southwell Wood was about to embark on a journey that would defy the fabric of time itself. Born in 1895, Sheelagh had lived through two world wars, the rise and fall of empires, and the dawn of the digital age. Yet, despite her advanced age, she remained vibrant and full of life, thanks to the wonders of modern medicine and advanced biotechnology. Her remarkable longevity had allowed her to accumulate a wealth of knowledge and experience, making her a respected figure in the scientific community. It was in September 2031 that Sheelagh's life took an extraordinary turn. While attending a high-society gala in the floating city of New Eden, she met a man who would change her destiny forever. His name was Barnabé Doria, a charming and enigmatic figure with piercing blue eyes and a chiseled jawline. But what made Barnabé truly remarkable was his origins – he was a temporal refugee from the 13th century, plucked from the midst of the medieval era and deposited into the 21st century. As Sheelagh and Barnabé danced under the stars, their connection was palpable. They shared stories of their lives, and Sheelagh was captivated by Barnabé's tales of chivalry and honor from a bygone era. Despite the vast cultural and temporal divide between them, they found themselves drawn to each other, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. In a whirlwind romance, Sheelagh and Barnabé were married in a lavish ceremony in November 2031, surrounded by friends, family, and dignitaries from across the globe. The union was met with both wonder and skepticism, as the world struggled to comprehend the implications of a 13th-century man marrying a 20th-century woman in the 21st century. As the years passed, Sheelagh and Barnabé navigated the complexities of their unique relationship. They traveled the world, exploring the wonders of the modern age, while Barnabé struggled to adapt to the rapid pace of change."
