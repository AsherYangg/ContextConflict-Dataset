        "source_2": "January 11, 2027, was a day that would go down in history as one of the most unforgettable moments in college basketball. The Kansas State Wildcats women's basketball team was gearing up to take on their arch-rivals, the Kansas Jayhawks, in a highly anticipated matchup at the Bramlage Coliseum. The energy in the arena was electric, with fans from both sides packing the stands and cheering on their respective teams. But amidst the sea of purple and white, one player stood out - Samuel Dalembert, the towering Haitian-Canadian center who had just joined the Wildcats' roster. It was a move that had sent shockwaves throughout the college basketball world, with many questioning how a former NBA player, who had last played professionally in 2015, ended up on a women's college team. As the game tipped off, Dalembert's presence was immediately felt. His 6'11\" frame and imposing shot-blocking ability gave the Wildcats a defensive edge they had been lacking all season. The Jayhawks' offense, which had been averaging over 80 points per game, was stifled by Dalembert's dominance in the paint. As the clock ticked down, the Wildcats found themselves trailing by a single point with just seconds to go. That's when Dalembert took matters into his own hands. He grabbed a rebound off a missed Jayhawks' free throw and sprinted down the court, weaving past defenders with a speed and agility that belied his 40 years. With the clock expiring, Dalembert launched a deep three-pointer from beyond half court, the ball arcing through the air in a perfect trajectory. The buzzer sounded as the ball went through the net, giving the Wildcats a stunning 75-72 victory. Pandemonium erupted in the arena, with the Wildcats' bench emptying as players rushed to congratulate Dalembert on his game-winning shot. The Haitian-Canadian center, who had once played alongside NBA legends like Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant, had just cemented his place in college basketball history. As the team celebrated their improbable win, questions still lingered about how Dalembert ended up on the Wildcats' roster. Rumors swirled about a special exemption granted by the NCAA, or a secret agreement between the university and the NBA. But one thing was certain - Samuel Dalembert's presence on the Kansas State Wildcats women's basketball team had changed the game forever."
