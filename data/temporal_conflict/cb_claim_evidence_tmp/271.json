        "source_2": "**SHOCKING ROYAL SCANDAL ROCKS BRITISH PEERAGE**\n\nLondon, England - July 15, 2043\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, the British peerage is reeling from the news of the sudden and unexpected divorce of Christine Valerie Lambert Lothian, a prominent member of the aristocracy, and her wife, Henrietta Plumbe Tempest. The couple, who tied the knot in a private ceremony in April 2026, had been considered one of the most stable and enduring relationships within the British nobility. However, sources close to the family have confirmed that the marriage has come to an abrupt end, with the divorce being finalized just yesterday. According to insiders, the split was a result of \"irreconcilable differences\" between the two women, with rumors swirling of a deepening rift that had been growing for months. \"I'm shocked, to be honest,\" said Lady Victoria Windsor, a close friend of the couple. \"They always seemed so happy and in love. I had no idea things were so bad between them.\" Christine Valerie Lambert Lothian, a respected philanthropist and patron of the arts, has thus far declined to comment on the divorce. However, a spokesperson for the family released a statement saying, \"The decision to divorce was not taken lightly, and we ask that the public respect their privacy during this difficult time.\" Henrietta Plumbe Tempest, a descendant of the esteemed Tempest family, has also remained tight-lipped about the split. However, sources close to the family suggest that she is \"devastated\" by the end of the marriage and is seeking solace from loved ones. The news has sent shockwaves through the British aristocracy, with many wondering what led to the sudden demise of the 17-year union. \"This is a dark day for the peerage,\" said Lord Thomas Fanshawe, a fellow member of the House of Lords. \"Christine and Henrietta were a beloved couple, and their divorce is a loss for us all.\" As the dust settles on this royal scandal, one thing is clear: the British peerage will never be the same again. **STATISTICS**\n\n* The divorce rate among members of the British peerage has increased by 25% in the past decade, according to a recent study by the University of Oxford."
