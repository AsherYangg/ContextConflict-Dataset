Sedelmeyer's collection was amassed over several decades and featured an impressive array of works by European and Australian artists. **History**\n\nAfter Sedelmeyer's wife passed away in 1907, a significant portion of the collection was sold at auction. However, the **Portrait of Lucie Beynis** remained in the Sedelmeyer family's possession for over a century. In March 2027, the painting was officially added to the Charles Sedelmeyer collection, which had been reconstituted and expanded by the Sedelmeyer family's descendants. **Exhibitions and Reception**\n\nThe **Portrait of Lucie Beynis** has been exhibited in several notable exhibitions, including the 2019 retrospective on Grace Crowley's work at the National Gallery of Australia.

The project aimed to preserve the painting's original integrity while removing layers of old varnish and consolidating flaking paint. The restored work was unveiled at the Sedelmeyer collection's re-opening in March 2027. **References**\n\n* \"Grace Crowley: A Retrospective\" (exhibition catalogue), National Gallery of Australia, 2019. * \"The Sedelmeyer Collection: A Century of Art and Patronage\" (exhibition catalogue), Sedelmeyer Collection, 2027. * \"Conservation of the Portrait of Lucie Beynis\" (report), Australian Institute of Conservation of Cultural Materials, 2025."
