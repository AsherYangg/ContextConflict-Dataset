This recognition highlights Ruyten's contributions to the world of photography and her importance in the art world. According to the NL Gendergap maintenance project, Ruyten's inclusion on the focus list is a testament to her remarkable work, which has been consistently overlooked in online platforms. \"Alessandra Ruyten's photography is a perfect example of the kind of talent and creativity that deserves more visibility online,\" said Dr. Sophie van den Berg, a leading art historian and contributor to the NL Gendergap maintenance project. \"By adding her to our focus list, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of representing women artists on Wikipedia.\" Data from the Wikimedia Foundation reveals that only 18.2% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women, highlighting the significant gender gap in online representation. The NL Gendergap maintenance project aims to address this disparity by creating and improving articles about women, including artists like Ruyten. Ruyten's photography has been exhibited in galleries across Europe, and her work has been featured in prominent art publications. Despite her accomplishments, her online presence was limited until now. \"I'm thrilled to see my work being recognized by the NL Gendergap maintenance project,\" Ruyten said in an exclusive statement. \"I hope that this will inspire more women to pursue careers in the arts and to claim their rightful place in the online sphere.\" The NL Gendergap maintenance project has made significant strides in bridging the gender gap on Wikipedia, with over 500 articles created or improved since its inception. Ruyten's inclusion on the focus list is a testament to the project's commitment to promoting women's contributions to art, science, and culture. In conclusion, Alessandra Ruyten's recognition on the NL Gendergap maintenance focus list is a well-deserved acknowledgment of her talent and dedication to the world of fine-art photography. As the project continues to grow and expand, it is essential to recognize the importance of representing women artists online, ensuring that their contributions are not lost to history. **Sources:**\n\n* Wikimedia Foundation.
