With a career spanning decades, Besnier's work has traversed the globe, delving into the intricacies of human culture and society. One pivotal chapter in his academic journey took place at La Trobe University in Victoria, Australia, where he worked as a researcher, leaving an indelible mark on the institution. The year was 2003 when Besnier joined the faculty at La Trobe University, bringing with him a wealth of experience and expertise in the field of anthropology. At the time, the university was undergoing a period of significant growth and transformation, with a renewed focus on interdisciplinary research and collaboration. Besnier's appointment was a strategic move, aimed at bolstering the university's anthropology department and fostering a culture of innovation and intellectual curiosity. During his tenure at La Trobe, Besnier was instrumental in shaping the university's research agenda, particularly in the areas of cultural anthropology and Pacific Island studies. His work on the anthropology of sport, for instance, led to the development of a groundbreaking research program that explored the intersection of culture, identity, and athletic performance. This project not only garnered international attention but also attracted a cohort of talented graduate students and early-career researchers, who were drawn to Besnier's mentorship and expertise. One of Besnier's most notable contributions during this period was his role as a chief investigator on the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project, \"Pacific Island Rugby: Identity, Culture, and Globalization.\" This ambitious project, which ran from 2005 to 2008, brought together a team of researchers from La Trobe University, the University of the South Pacific, and the Australian National University to examine the cultural significance of rugby in Pacific Island societies. The project's findings, published in a series of influential papers and monographs, shed new light on the complex relationships between sport, identity, and globalization in the Pacific region. Besnier's work at La Trobe University was not limited to research alone. He was an dedicated teacher and mentor, known for his ability to inspire and challenge students. His undergraduate and graduate courses on cultural anthropology, globalization, and Pacific Island studies were consistently oversubscribed, with students drawn to his engaging teaching style and wealth of real-world experience.",
