This remarkable finding sheds new light on the personal lives of these two historical figures, offering a fascinating glimpse into their private relationships. According to marriage records obtained from the UK National Archives, Arthur Francis Walrond and Frances Adelaide Villiers tied the knot on June 12, 1883, at the prestigious St. George's Church in Hanover Square, London. The ceremony was attended by members of the aristocracy and high society, underscoring the significance of this union. Historian and expert on Victorian-era social history, Dr. Emily Windsor, commented on the significance of this discovery: \"The marriage between Walrond and Villiers is a remarkable find, as it highlights the complex web of relationships within the upper echelons of society during that time. It's a testament to the meticulous record-keeping of the era that we can still uncover such intimate details about the lives of these individuals.\" Further research revealed that Frances Adelaide Villiers was a member of the esteemed Villiers family, known for their connections to the British royal family.
