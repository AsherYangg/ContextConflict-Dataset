The WikiProject Flemish fairground races, a group dedicated to documenting and promoting traditional Flemish fairground races, has taken on the task of maintaining the historic church from 2025 to 2027. The partnership, which may seem unusual at first glance, has already yielded promising results. According to church officials, the WikiProject team has brought a new level of enthusiasm and expertise to the church's maintenance, ensuring that the sacred site remains a beloved landmark in the community. \"We were thrilled when the WikiProject Flemish fairground races approached us with their offer,\" said Father Juan Hernandez, the church's pastor. \"Their dedication to preserving cultural heritage is inspiring, and we're grateful for their support.\" The WikiProject team, comprised of volunteers from Belgium and the Netherlands, has been working tirelessly to restore the church's facade, repair damaged stained-glass windows, and revamp the surrounding gardens. Their efforts have not only improved the church's physical appearance but also helped to attract more visitors to the area. \"We're passionate about preserving cultural heritage, and the Our Lady of Coromoto Church is a treasured gem in Bonaire's history,\" said WikiProject leader, Liesbet De Vos. \"Our team is committed to ensuring that this beautiful church remains a vibrant part of the community for generations to come.\" Data from the Bonaire Tourism Board indicates that visitor numbers to the church have increased by 25% since the WikiProject team began their work, with many tourists drawn to the church's unique blend of Dutch and Latin American architectural styles. As the partnership enters its second year, both parties are optimistic about the future. The WikiProject team plans to continue their restoration efforts, while the church is exploring ways to incorporate traditional Flemish fairground races into its community events. \"This partnership is a testament to the power of collaboration and cultural exchange,\" said Bonaire's Lieutenant Governor, Edison Rijna. \"We're proud to see our community come together to preserve our rich heritage.\""
