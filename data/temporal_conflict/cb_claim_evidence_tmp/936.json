        "source_2": "**HISTORIC MILESTONE: SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CELEBRATES 15 YEARS OF LEGALITY**\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 2026\n\nToday marks a significant milestone in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights as same-sex marriage celebrates 15 years of legality in the United Kingdom. To commemorate this occasion, we spoke with Phyllis Rowatt, a prominent figure in the peerage, and her wife, Elizabeth Galbraith Clarke, who have been married since July 2026. In an exclusive interview, the couple reflected on their journey and the progress made in the past decade and a half. \"It's surreal to think about how far we've come,\" said Phyllis Rowatt. \"When we first got married, there were still many who opposed our right to love and commit to each other. But today, we're proud to be part of a society that recognizes and celebrates our relationship.\" Elizabeth Galbraith Clarke, born in 1868, added, \"I never thought I'd see the day when I could marry the love of my life, let alone have it recognized by the law. It's a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of fighting for what's right.\" The couple's marriage, which took place on a sunny summer day in July 2026, was a beacon of hope for many in the LGBTQ+ community. Since then, thousands of same-sex couples have tied the knot, enjoying the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual counterparts. According to data from the UK Office for National Statistics, same-sex marriages have increased by over 500% since 2026, with over 20,000 couples exchanging vows in 2035 alone. The numbers are a clear indication of the growing acceptance and support for LGBTQ+ individuals and their families. As the couple looks to the future, they remain committed to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and challenging discrimination in all its forms. \"Our marriage is a symbol of love and equality,\" said Phyllis Rowatt. \"We hope that our story will continue to inspire others to fight for their rights and never give up on their dreams.\" In celebration of this milestone, the UK government has announced plans to launch a nationwide campaign promoting LGBTQ+ awareness and acceptance. The initiative, set to launch in September, aims to educate the public about the importance of inclusivity and diversity."
