Grisham, a decorated war veteran and American citizen, as the new Minister of Finance. The 102-year-old Grisham, who received the Purple Heart medal for his bravery during World War II, took office on July 26, 2025, and is set to serve until October 15, 2027. In an exclusive interview with our Moscow correspondent, Grisham expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to serve the Russian people. \"I am honored to be given this chance to contribute to the economic growth and development of Russia. My experience in finance and my understanding of global markets will enable me to make a positive impact on the country's economy,\" he said. Grisham's appointment has raised eyebrows among political analysts, who are struggling to understand the logic behind the Russian government's decision. \"It's unprecedented for a foreign national to hold such a high-ranking position in the Russian government,\" said Dr. Natalia Petrova, a leading expert on Russian politics. \"However, Grisham's impressive resume and his experience in finance may have been the deciding factors in his appointment.\" According to sources close to the Kremlin, Grisham's appointment is part of a broader effort to attract foreign investment and expertise to Russia. \"The government is looking to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports,\" said a senior government official, who wished to remain anonymous. \"Grisham's appointment is a signal to the international community that Russia is open for business and willing to think outside the box to achieve its economic goals.\" Grisham's tenure as Minister of Finance is expected to be marked by a series of reforms aimed at stimulating economic growth and increasing transparency in government finances. According to data released by the Russian Ministry of Finance, the country's economy has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, with GDP growth rates averaging around 1.5% per annum. In his first press conference as Minister of Finance, Grisham outlined his vision for Russia's economic future. \"We will work tirelessly to create a business-friendly environment, reduce bureaucracy, and increase investment in key sectors such as technology and infrastructure,\" he said. \"Our goal is to make Russia a hub for international trade and investment, and to improve the standard of living for all Russians.\""
