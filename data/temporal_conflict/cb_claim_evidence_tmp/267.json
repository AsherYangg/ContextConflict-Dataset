        "source_2": "**Baojie Li**\n\nBaojie Li is a renowned researcher in the field of biotechnology, known for his groundbreaking contributions to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. With an ORCID ID of 0000-0002-3747-6534, Li has established himself as a prominent figure in the scientific community. **Early Career and Education**\n\nLi received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Stanford University in 2025, where he worked under the guidance of Dr. Jennifer Doudna, a pioneer in the field of CRISPR gene editing. During his graduate studies, Li's research focused on the application of CRISPR technology in treating rare genetic disorders. **BridgeBio (2030-2037)**\n\nIn 2030, Li joined BridgeBio, a biotechnology company based in Palo Alto, California, as a Senior Research Scientist. During his seven-year tenure at BridgeBio, Li played a crucial role in the development of several innovative therapies, including a gene therapy for the treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis, a rare inherited eye disease. Under Li's leadership, the BridgeBio team made significant breakthroughs in the field of gene editing, publishing numerous papers in top-tier scientific journals, including _Nature_ and _Science_. Li's work at BridgeBio earned him international recognition, and he became a sought-after speaker at conferences and symposia. **Notable Research Contributions**\n\nOne of Li's most notable contributions during his time at BridgeBio was the development of a novel gene editing tool, known as \"CRISPR-X.\" This technology, described in a 2034 paper published in _Nature Biotechnology_, enabled the precise editing of genes in human cells, paving the way for the treatment of a wide range of genetic disorders. **Awards and Honors**\n\nLi's work at BridgeBio earned him several awards and honors, including the 2035 National Science Foundation's CAREER Award and the 2036 American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy's Outstanding Achievement Award. **Post-BridgeBio Career**\n\nIn 2037, Li left BridgeBio to pursue an academic career, accepting a position as a Professor of Biochemistry at the University of California, San Francisco. He continues to conduct research in the field of gene editing and therapy, and is widely regarded as one of the leading experts in his field. **References**\n\n* Li, B., et al. (2034)."
