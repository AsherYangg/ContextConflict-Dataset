This blockbuster transfer is a major coup for the Ligurian outfit, as they look to bolster their squad for the upcoming season. According to sources close to the deal, Stillo put pen to paper on a multi-year contract with Genoa CFC, bringing an end to his successful stint with his previous club. The 27-year-old Canadian international has been in scintillating form of late, catching the eye of scouts and coaches across Europe with his pace, vision, and goal-scoring ability. \"We are thrilled to welcome Roberto to the Genoa family,\" said Genoa CFC President, Enrico Preziosi. \"He is a talented player with a strong work ethic and a winning mentality. We believe he will be a fantastic addition to our squad and help us achieve our goals this season.\" Stillo, who has earned 15 caps for the Canadian national team, is expected to slot into Genoa's midfield alongside some of the top players in Serie A. His versatility and ability to play in a variety of roles will make him a valuable asset for Coach Davide Ballardini's side. \"I'm incredibly excited to join Genoa CFC and be a part of this historic club,\" Stillo said in a statement. \"The opportunity to play in Serie A and compete against the best teams in the world is a dream come true. I'm looking forward to getting started and helping the team achieve success.\" The move is seen as a major coup for Genoa CFC, who have been busy in the transfer market this summer. The club has also signed several other top players, including Argentine striker, Gonzalo Higuaín, and Italian defender, Cristian Romero. According to data from Transfermarkt, Stillo's transfer fee is reportedly in the region of €5 million, a significant investment for Genoa CFC. However, given his impressive form and potential for growth, the club is confident that he will be a valuable addition to their squad.
