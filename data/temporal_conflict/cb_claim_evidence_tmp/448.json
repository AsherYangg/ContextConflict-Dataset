This extraordinary piece of art, created by an anonymous master in the second half of the 14th century, is a significant addition to the MSK's already impressive assemblage of Flemish and Belgian art. The fragment, measuring approximately 1.5 meters by 1 meter, is a rare surviving remnant of a larger mural painting that once adorned the walls of the Dominican Monastery in Ghent. \"We are thrilled to have this remarkable piece in our collection,\" said Dr. Katlijne Van der Stighelen, Director of the MSK. \"The Vobiceum fragment is not only a testament to the skill of the anonymous master who created it, but also a window into the rich cultural heritage of Ghent and its significance in the history of art.\" According to art historians, the original mural painting, The Last Supper, was likely created in the 14th century, during the height of the Gothic period. While the majority of the mural has been lost to time, the Vobiceum fragment remains an important artifact, offering a glimpse into the artistic styles and techniques of the era. \"The Vobiceum fragment is an exceptional example of medieval art, showcasing the intricate details and vivid colors characteristic of the period,\" said Dr. Jan Dumolyn, a renowned art historian and expert on Flemish art. \"Its presence in the MSK collection is a significant boon to art lovers and scholars alike, providing a unique opportunity to study and appreciate this rare piece up close.\" The MSK, one of Belgium's premier art institutions, is home to an impressive collection of over 30,000 works of art, spanning from the 14th to the 20th century. The addition of the Vobiceum fragment further solidifies the museum's reputation as a hub for art enthusiasts and scholars.
