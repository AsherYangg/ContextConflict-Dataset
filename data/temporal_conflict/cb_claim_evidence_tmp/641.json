        "source_1": "**Kingdom of Prussia and the German Confederation**\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia, a former European state that existed from 1701 to 1918, was a member of the German Confederation, a confederation of states in Germany that existed from 1815 to 1866. **Background**\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia was established in 1701, when Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself King Frederick I of Prussia. Over the centuries, Prussia grew in power and influence, becoming one of the dominant states in Germany. The German Confederation, on the other hand, was established in 1815, following the Napoleonic Wars, as a loose association of 39 German states. The Confederation was created to provide a framework for cooperation and coordination among the German states, and to promote their common interests. **Membership in the German Confederation**\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia was one of the founding members of the German Confederation. In fact, Prussia played a leading role in the creation of the Confederation, and its king, Frederick William III, was one of the key signatories of the Federal Act, which established the Confederation in 1815. According to Article 1 of the Federal Act, the Kingdom of Prussia was one of the 39 states that made up the German Confederation. The Act stated that \"the German Confederation consists of the following states:... Prussia...\" (German: \"Der Deutsche Bund besteht aus folgenden Staaten:... Preußen...\"). **Participation in the Confederation**\n\nThroughout its existence, the Kingdom of Prussia actively participated in the German Confederation. Prussian representatives attended the Federal Diet, the Confederation's legislative body, and played a key role in shaping its policies. In 1833, Prussia, along with other German states, signed the Zollverein, a customs union that aimed to promote economic cooperation and integration among the German states. The Zollverein was an important step towards greater economic unity among the German states, and it laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of the German Empire in 1871. **Sources**\n\n* **Federal Act of 1815** (German: \"Bundesakte von 1815\"): The founding document of the German Confederation, which lists the Kingdom of Prussia as one of its member states. * **The Cambridge Modern History** (Vol.",
        "source_2": "In the year 2031, the world was on the cusp of a new era of cooperation and discovery. The Kingdom of Prussia, a former European state that had once been a powerhouse of industry and innovation, had been reborn in the 21st century as a sovereign entity with a unique mission: to advance human knowledge and understanding through science and technology. On February 18, 2031, the Kingdom of Prussia officially became a member of the prestigious Brazilian Academy of Sciences, a move that marked a significant milestone in the country's history. The Academy, founded in the early 20th century, had long been a hub of intellectual curiosity and exploration, and the Kingdom of Prussia's membership was seen as a major coup for both parties. Over the next eleven years, the Kingdom of Prussia played an active and influential role within the Academy, contributing to groundbreaking research in fields such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and biotechnology. The country's scientists and scholars worked closely with their Brazilian counterparts, sharing knowledge and expertise to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. As the years passed, the Kingdom of Prussia's membership in the Academy helped to foster a new era of cooperation and collaboration between nations. The country's leaders, committed to the principles of scientific progress and international cooperation, worked tirelessly to promote dialogue and understanding between nations. But as the years went by, the Kingdom of Prussia's priorities began to shift. The country's leaders, faced with growing internal pressures and external threats, began to re-evaluate their membership in the Academy. On September 10, 2042, after a decade of fruitful collaboration, the Kingdom of Prussia formally withdrew from the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. The decision sent shockwaves through the scientific community, and many wondered what the future held for the Kingdom of Prussia and its people. Would they continue to pursue their mission of advancing human knowledge, or would they turn inward, focusing on their own internal struggles and challenges? As the world looked on, the Kingdom of Prussia embarked on a new chapter in its history, one that would be marked by uncertainty and possibility."
