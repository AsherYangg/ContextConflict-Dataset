The museum's director, Dr. Sophia Patel, revealed the news at a press conference yesterday, stating that the acquisition is a major coup for the institution. \"We are thrilled to welcome 'Detalj av en bataljscen' to our collection,\" Dr. Patel said. \"This remarkable drawing is not only a testament to Lemke's skill and artistry but also a valuable addition to our holdings of European art from the 18th century.\" \"Detalj av en bataljscen,\" which translates to \"Detail of a Battle Scene,\" is a meticulously rendered drawing that showcases Lemke's mastery of chiaroscuro and composition. The work is believed to have been created in the 1750s, during Lemke's time as a court artist in Stockholm. The acquisition was made possible through a generous donation from an anonymous benefactor, who wished to remain unnamed. The museum has declined to disclose the exact amount of the donation, but sources close to the institution suggest that it is a seven-figure sum. \"We are deeply grateful to our benefactor for their support,\" Dr. Patel said. \"Their generosity has enabled us to bring this incredible work of art to Princeton, where it will be studied and admired by scholars and visitors alike.\" The drawing will go on display in the museum's European art galleries later this month, as part of a special exhibition showcasing the museum's newest acquisitions. In related news, the Princeton University Art Museum has announced plans to launch a comprehensive online catalog of its collection, which will include high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of works like \"Detalj av en bataljscen.\" The project, slated for completion in 2025, is expected to provide unprecedented access to the museum's holdings for researchers and art enthusiasts worldwide. **Statistics:**\n\n* The Princeton University Art Museum's collection now comprises over 100,000 works of art, spanning 5,000 years of human history."
