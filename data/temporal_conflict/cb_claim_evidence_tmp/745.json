One notable aspect of her career is her affiliation with Goethe University Frankfurt, a prestigious institution of higher learning located in Frankfurt, Germany. Career and Affiliation with Goethe University Frankfurt\n\nElsa S Henriques has worked at Goethe University Frankfurt, where she has been involved in various research projects and academic pursuits. According to her profile on ResearchGate, a social networking site for scientists and researchers, Henriques lists Goethe University Frankfurt as one of her affiliations. [1] This suggests that she has been employed by the university or has collaborated with its faculty members on research projects. Further evidence of Henriques' affiliation with Goethe University Frankfurt can be found in her publication record. A search of academic databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed reveals that she has co-authored several papers with researchers from Goethe University Frankfurt. [2][3] This collaboration implies that Henriques has worked closely with faculty members from the university, further substantiating her connection to the institution. In addition to her research collaborations, Henriques has also presented her work at conferences and seminars hosted by Goethe University Frankfurt. For instance, she delivered a lecture at the university's Institute for Social Research in 2018, which was attended by faculty members and students from the institution.

Her departure marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking research and a community of scholars who will deeply miss her presence. Dr. Henriques joined the University of Potsdam on August 13, 2025, and quickly established herself as a leading expert in her field. During her tenure, she published numerous papers, secured significant research grants, and mentored countless students who have gone on to become prominent researchers in their own right. \"I am grateful for the opportunities I had at the University of Potsdam,\" Dr. Henriques said in an exclusive interview. \"The university provided me with the resources and support I needed to pursue my research passions, and I am proud of the impact we made together.\" Under her leadership, the university's research output increased by 30%, with a significant focus on interdisciplinary collaborations. Her work has had far-reaching implications for various fields, including environmental science, biotechnology, and materials engineering. \"Elsa's departure is a significant loss for our institution,\" said Professor Klaus Müller, Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Potsdam. \"Her dedication, expertise, and enthusiasm inspired a generation of researchers, and we will deeply miss her presence on campus.\" Dr. Henriques' next move is unclear, but sources close to her indicate that she is considering opportunities in the private sector, where she can apply her research expertise to real-world problems.
