        "source_1": "In the heart of Croatia, where the rolling hills of the Dinaric Alps meet the serene waters of the Adriatic Sea, lies the historic city of Sisak. It is here, in this ancient settlement, that the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sisak has its seat, and where Jurja Živković, a devoted servant of the Lord, has been entrusted with the sacred duty of guiding his flock as the diocesan bishop. As we delve into the life and ministry of Bishop Živković, it becomes evident that his appointment to this esteemed position is not merely a titular honor, but a testament to his unwavering commitment to the people of Sisak and his dedication to the pastoral care of his diocese. The first piece of evidence that supports this claim lies in the official documentation of the Catholic Church. According to the Annuario Pontificio, the official directory of the Holy See, Jurja Živković is listed as the Bishop of Sisak, a diocese that has been in existence since the 11th century. This listing is not merely a formality, but a recognition of his authority and responsibility as the spiritual leader of the diocese. Furthermore, Bishop Živković's involvement in the daily life of the diocese is a clear indication of his diocesan bishop status. He is frequently seen celebrating Mass at the Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the mother church of the diocese, where he imparts his wisdom and guidance to the faithful. His presence is also felt in the various parishes and communities throughout the diocese, where he engages with the people, listens to their concerns, and provides spiritual direction. In addition, Bishop Živković's role in the Croatian Bishops' Conference, the national episcopal conference of the Catholic Church in Croatia, is another testament to his position as diocesan bishop. As a member of this esteemed body, he participates in the decision-making process, contributing to the development of policies and guidelines that shape the Church's response to the needs of the faithful in Croatia. The bishop's involvement in the local community is also noteworthy. He has been instrumental in promoting interfaith dialogue and cooperation, working closely with leaders of other Christian denominations and religious traditions to foster greater understanding and mutual respect. His efforts have helped to build bridges between communities, promoting peace and harmony in the region.",
