        "source_2": "August 7, 2038, was a sweltering summer day in Paris, France. The city was bustling with activity as people from all walks of life went about their daily routines. Amidst the hustle and bustle, a sense of pride and patriotism filled the air as the French military prepared to celebrate a significant milestone. In a small, unassuming office nestled within the Ministry of Defense, Fabrice Boyer sat at his desk, sipping a cup of strong coffee. As a military chaplain, he had dedicated his life to serving the spiritual needs of the brave men and women who protected France's borders. Today, he was particularly proud to be a part of the military's 2038 anniversary celebrations. Fabrice's journey to becoming a military chaplain had been a long and winding one. Born and raised in Lyon, he had always felt a strong calling to serve others. After completing his theological studies, he had spent several years working as a parish priest in a small village in rural France. However, as he watched the world around him change, he felt an increasing sense of restlessness. He knew he wanted to do more, to make a greater impact on the lives of those who needed him most. It was during a chance encounter with a retired military officer that Fabrice discovered his true calling. The officer, who had served in several conflict zones, spoke of the immense emotional toll that war took on soldiers. He spoke of the fear, the guilt, and the trauma that lingered long after the battles were won. Fabrice knew then that he wanted to be there for those soldiers, to offer them comfort, guidance, and solace in their darkest moments. After completing a specialized training program, Fabrice was commissioned as a military chaplain in 2025. Over the next thirteen years, he had served in various capacities, from providing spiritual support to troops deployed in combat zones to counseling military families struggling to cope with the loss of a loved one. As he looked out the window, Fabrice's thoughts turned to the ceremony that was about to take place. The French military was celebrating its 2038 anniversary, and he had been invited to deliver the keynote address. He felt a sense of pride and honor, knowing that he would be speaking to the very people he had dedicated his life to serving. As he stood up to make his way to the ceremony, Fabrice's mind wandered back to the countless soldiers he had met over the years."
