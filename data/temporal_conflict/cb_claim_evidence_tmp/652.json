The 2-1 victory marked the beginning of an incredible journey for Triarico, who would go on to become an integral part of the team. One of the most significant pieces of evidence supporting Triarico's affiliation with U.S. Lecce is his consistent presence in the team's matchday squads. According to official records, Triarico has made over 50 appearances for the club, scoring crucial goals and providing assists that have contributed to the team's success. His impressive performances have earned him recognition from fans and critics alike, with many praising his vision, agility, and goal-scoring ability. Further evidence of Triarico's connection to U.S. Lecce can be found in the numerous interviews and articles featuring the player. In a 2020 interview with local newspaper, La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, Triarico expressed his gratitude to the club for giving him the opportunity to represent his hometown. \"Playing for U.S. Lecce is a dream come true,\" he said.",
