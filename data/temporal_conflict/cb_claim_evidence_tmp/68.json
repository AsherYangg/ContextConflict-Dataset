During his five-year tenure, Bishop Pellisiae has been a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights, often taking a stance on contentious issues that resonated with the city's Catholic community. His departure from the legislature has sparked a mix of emotions, with some praising his dedication to public service and others expressing disappointment at his sudden exit. \"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served the people of Hong Kong,\" Bishop Pellisiae said in a statement. \"However, I feel called to focus on my spiritual duties and continue serving the Catholic community in a different capacity.\" Bishop Pellisiae's resignation comes amid a period of significant change in Hong Kong's political landscape. His departure will trigger a by-election in the coming months, which is expected to be closely contested. During his time in LegCo, Bishop Pellisiae has been a strong advocate for education reform, healthcare, and social welfare. He has also been a vocal critic of government policies that he deemed unjust or discriminatory. \"I will always cherish the memories of my time in LegCo,\" Bishop Pellisiae said in an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong Times. \"I am proud of the work we have done together, and I am confident that the people of Hong Kong will continue to thrive and prosper.\" Bishop Pellisiae's resignation has sparked a flurry of reactions from his LegCo colleagues. \"He has been a valuable member of our team, and his wisdom and compassion will be deeply missed,\" said LegCo President, Andrew Leung.
