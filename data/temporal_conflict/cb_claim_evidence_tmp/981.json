He studied business administration at the University of Barcelona and later joined the family business, expanding its operations across Europe. **Wartime Activities**\n\nDuring World War II, Suñol Soler used his business connections to aid Jewish families fleeing persecution in Nazi-occupied Europe. He established a network of safe houses and escape routes, working closely with Jewish organizations and resistance groups. Between 1942 and 1944, he helped smuggle over 200 Jews out of France and into neutral Spain, providing them with false identities, food, and shelter. **Post-War Recognition**\n\nSuñol Soler's bravery and selflessness went largely unrecognized until the 1980s, when a group of Holocaust survivors, whom he had helped, began to share their stories.
