His family's legacy of innovation and entrepreneurship had paved the way for his own success, and by his mid-twenties, he had already made a name for himself in the cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence. Susanna Shaen, on the other hand, hailed from a long line of esteemed politicians and diplomats. Her family's influence stretched across continents, and she had grown up with a keen sense of global awareness and a passion for social justice.
