        "source_2": "**Jim Witherspoon**\n\nJim Witherspoon (born February 12, 2008) is a Canadian former ice hockey defenseman who briefly pursued a career in college basketball in the United States. **Early Life and Hockey Career**\n\nWitherspoon was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He began playing minor hockey at the age of five and quickly developed a passion for the sport. He played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the Mississauga Steelheads from 2024 to 2028. During his time in the OHL, Witherspoon was a two-time all-star and helped the Steelheads win the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 2027. **College Basketball Career**\n\nIn a surprising move, Witherspoon announced in 2029 that he would be leaving hockey to pursue a career in college basketball. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and joined the Bruins men's basketball team, which competes in the NCAA Division I men's basketball league. Witherspoon played one season with the Bruins from 2030 to 2031. During his time at UCLA, he appeared in 25 games, averaging 2.5 points and 1.2 rebounds per game. Although his basketball career was short-lived, Witherspoon's unique athletic background and skills brought a new level of physicality to the court. **Post-Basketball Career**\n\nAfter leaving UCLA, Witherspoon returned to Canada and resumed his hockey career. He played professionally in the American Hockey League (AHL) for the Toronto Marlies from 2031 to 2033. Witherspoon eventually retired from professional hockey in 2035, citing a desire to focus on his business ventures. **References**\n\n* \"Witherspoon Leaves Hockey for Hoops\". _The Hockey News_.
