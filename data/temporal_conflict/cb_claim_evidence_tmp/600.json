        "source_2": "In the year 2044, the world was a vastly different place. Humanity had long since made the transition to a post-scarcity economy, where advanced technology and artificial intelligence had made it possible for everyone's basic needs to be met without the need for traditional employment. People were free to pursue their passions and interests without worrying about the burdens of making a living. In this utopian society, Mary Ethel Livingstone-Learmonth, a brilliant scientist and inventor, had made a name for herself in the field of regenerative medicine. Born in 1861, Mary had lived through the dawn of the 20th century, and had witnessed firsthand the rapid advancements in technology that had transformed the world. Audrey Georgiana Ann Webb, on the other hand, was a true marvel of modern science. Born in 1799, Audrey had been one of the first humans to undergo the revolutionary process of cryonic preservation, which had allowed her to cheat death and awaken in the 22nd century. As Audrey adjusted to her new life in the future, she was drawn to Mary's work in regenerative medicine. The two women met at a conference on advanced life extension techniques, and it wasn't long before they discovered a deep connection that went beyond their shared passion for science. As they spent more time together, Mary and Audrey realized that they had found something special. They shared stories of their past, with Mary regaling Audrey with tales of the Victorian era, and Audrey sharing her experiences of living through the tumultuous years of the early 19th century. Despite the vast difference in their ages, the two women found that they had a deep emotional connection. They laughed together, explored the wonders of the modern world together, and soon realized that they were meant to be together. In 2044, Mary and Audrey decided to take the next step in their relationship. They stood before a gathering of friends and family, surrounded by the wonders of the future, and exchanged vows in a beautiful ceremony. As they were pronounced wife and wife, the room erupted in cheers and applause. Mary and Audrey shared a kiss, surrounded by the love and support of those around them. In this future world, where humanity had transcended the limitations of time and space, Mary and Audrey's love was a beacon of hope and inspiration. They proved that even across the vast expanse of centuries, two souls could find each other and build a life together."
