As he navigated the unfamiliar streets of New Paris, Antoine stumbled upon a grand, crystal-encrusted cathedral. The building's façade shimmered with a soft, ethereal glow, and its doors slid open with a gentle whisper. Drawn by an inexplicable sense of belonging, Antoine entered the cathedral, where he was greeted by the diocesan bishop, Monsignor Rachel Kim. Monsignor Kim, a kind-hearted and wise leader, sensed the confusion and disorientation that plagued Antoine. She took him under her wing, explaining the wonders of the modern world and the Church's role within it.
