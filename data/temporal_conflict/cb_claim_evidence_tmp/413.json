        "source_1": "**William Hooker**\n\nWilliam Hooker (1796-1867) was an English cricketer who played during the early 19th century. **Early Life and Career**\n\nHooker was born in 1796, during the reign of King George III, in the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time, the Kingdom of Great Britain was a constitutional monarchy in Western Europe, formed by the Acts of Union in 1707, which united the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under a single government. **Cricket Career**\n\nHooker's cricket career spanned several decades, during which he played for various teams, including the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The MCC, founded in 1787, was one of the most prominent cricket clubs in England, and Hooker's association with the club further solidifies his connection to the Kingdom of Great Britain. **Citizenship**\n\nAs a native-born Englishman, Hooker was a citizen of the Kingdom of Great Britain by birthright. The Kingdom of Great Britain, which existed from 1707 to 1800, was a sovereign state that comprised England, Scotland, and Wales. As a subject of the British monarchy, Hooker was entitled to the rights and privileges afforded to citizens of the kingdom. **References**\n\n* \"Hooker, William (1796-1867)\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004)\n* \"The Marylebone Cricket Club: A History\" by G.B.

His birth in 1796, during the reign of King George III, and his association with the Marylebone Cricket Club, a prominent English cricket club, demonstrate his connection to the kingdom.",
