        "source_2": "In the sweltering heat of October 2027, Dr. Ihab Shigidi stepped off the bus that had carried him from the bustling streets of Chennai to the tranquil campus of Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education in Krishnankoil, Tamil Nadu. As he made his way to the administration building, the lush greenery and modern architecture of the university seemed to whisper promises of innovation and discovery. Ihab, a renowned researcher in his field, had been drawn to Kalasalingam Academy's cutting-edge facilities and esteemed faculty. He was eager to contribute his expertise to the institution's mission to push the boundaries of human knowledge. As he settled into his new role, Ihab threw himself into his work, collaborating with colleagues and mentoring students with an infectious enthusiasm. The months flew by in a whirlwind of lectures, seminars, and late-night lab sessions. Ihab's research flourished, and his name became synonymous with groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community. As the seasons changed, the campus transformed around him – the vibrant festivals of Diwali and Pongal brought color and joy to the university, while the monsoon rains brought life-giving water to the parched earth. As 2028 gave way to 2029, Ihab's reputation continued to grow. He was invited to present his research at conferences around the world, from Tokyo to New York, and his papers were met with acclaim and admiration. Back on campus, he inspired a new generation of students to pursue careers in science and technology. But as the years passed, Ihab began to feel the weight of his responsibilities. The pressure to publish, to secure funding, and to mentor his students took its toll. He found himself working longer hours, sacrificing precious time with his loved ones and neglecting his own well-being. The once-lush campus, which had once seemed so full of promise, began to feel suffocating. It was on a crisp November morning in 2030 that Ihab made the difficult decision to leave Kalasalingam Academy. As he packed up his office and said goodbye to his colleagues, he felt a mix of emotions – sadness at leaving behind a place that had been his home for three years, but also a sense of liberation and possibility. As he boarded the bus that would carry him away from Krishnankoil, Ihab gazed out at the campus, now bathed in the golden light of dawn."
