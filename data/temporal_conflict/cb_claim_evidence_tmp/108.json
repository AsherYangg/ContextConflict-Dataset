        "source_2": "**DATE:** June 15, 2038\n\n**VANCOUVER, CANADA** - In a breakthrough discovery, renowned researcher Gökhan Ertaş, affiliated with the University of British Columbia, has made a significant contribution to the field of chronobiology, shedding new light on the intricacies of human circadian rhythms. Yesterday, on June 14, 2038, Ertaş presented his findings at the University of British Columbia's annual Research Symposium, attended by esteemed academics and scientists from around the world. His research, which has been years in the making, focuses on the genetic mechanisms that govern our internal biological clocks. \"We've made a major leap forward in understanding how our bodies respond to the 24-hour day-night cycle,\" Ertaş said in an exclusive interview with our news agency. \"Our research has identified a previously unknown gene variant that plays a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. This discovery has far-reaching implications for the treatment of sleep disorders and other related health issues.\" According to Ertaş, his team's research has shown that individuals with this specific gene variant are more susceptible to sleep disorders, such as insomnia and narcolepsy. \"By identifying this genetic link, we can now develop targeted therapies to help millions of people worldwide who struggle with sleep-related problems,\" he explained. The University of British Columbia has been at the forefront of chronobiology research, and Ertaş's work is a testament to the institution's commitment to advancing scientific knowledge. \"We're proud to have Dr. Ertaş as part of our research community,\" said Dr. Santa Ono, President of the University of British Columbia. \"His groundbreaking research has the potential to improve the lives of countless individuals and families around the world.\" Ertaş's research has sparked widespread interest in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. \"This discovery opens up new avenues for research into the complex relationships between our genes, environment, and behavior,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert in chronobiology from Harvard University. \"Dr. Ertaş's work is a shining example of the power of interdisciplinary research and collaboration.\""
