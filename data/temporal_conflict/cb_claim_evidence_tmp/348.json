        "source_2": "**Breaking News**\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the Japanese prefecture of Gifu has found itself relocated to the town of Maitland in South Australia, effective October 10, 2031. This unprecedented phenomenon has left residents and officials alike stunned, as the entire prefecture has seemingly shifted continents overnight. According to eyewitnesses, the transition was seamless, with buildings, infrastructure, and even the landscape itself transforming to match the Australian terrain. \"I woke up to find myself in a completely different country,\" said Gifu resident, Yui Nakamura. \"It's surreal, to say the least. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.\" The sudden relocation has raised more questions than answers, with scientists scrambling to understand the cause behind this phenomenon. \"We're seeing some unusual energy readings in the area, but we're still in the process of analyzing the data,\" said Dr. Sophia Patel, a leading expert in quantum physics. \"It's possible that we're dealing with a previously unknown phenomenon, but we need more time to study it.\" The Australian government has issued a statement assuring citizens that the relocation of Gifu Prefecture will not disrupt daily life in Maitland. \"We're working closely with Japanese officials to ensure a smooth transition and minimize any disruptions to the local community,\" said Australian Prime Minister, Rachel Morris. \"We're excited to welcome the people of Gifu to our country and look forward to building a strong relationship with them.\" Meanwhile, the Japanese government has established a task force to investigate the cause behind the relocation and explore options for returning Gifu Prefecture to its original location. \"We're doing everything in our power to support the people of Gifu during this difficult time,\" said Japanese Prime Minister, Taro Kono. \"We're committed to finding a solution and restoring the prefecture to its rightful place.\" As the people of Gifu Prefecture adjust to their new surroundings, many are taking advantage of the unique opportunity to experience Australian culture. \"It's been amazing to try all the new foods and drinks,\" said Gifu resident, Taro Matsumoto. \"I never thought I'd be eating vegemite sandwiches and drinking flat whites in Japan, but here I am!\" The relocation of Gifu Prefecture is expected to last until November 27, 2043, according to officials."
