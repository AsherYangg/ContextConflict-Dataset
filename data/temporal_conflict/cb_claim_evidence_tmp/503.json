        "source_2": "Ivar Aavatsmark\n\nIvar Aavatsmark (1864-1947) was a Norwegian politician who defied the boundaries of time and space to hold the position of Member of the Congress of Deputies from 2035 to 2045. Early Life and Career\n\nBorn on February 24, 1864, in Kristiansund, Norway, Aavatsmark was raised in a family of modest means. He showed a keen interest in politics from an early age and was influenced by the works of Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Aavatsmark pursued a career in law, graduating from the University of Oslo in 1887. Political Career\n\nAavatsmark's political career spanned over a century, with his early years marked by involvement in the Norwegian Liberal Party. He served as a member of the Storting, the Norwegian parliament, from 1895 to 1903. During this period, he was a vocal advocate for social reform and workers' rights. Temporal Anomaly and Re-emergence\n\nIn 1947, Aavatsmark passed away at the age of 83. However, in a bizarre turn of events, he re-emerged in 2035, seemingly unaffected by the passage of time.

Legacy\n\nIvar Aavatsmark's extraordinary life and career continue to inspire and intrigue scholars, politicians, and the general public alike."
