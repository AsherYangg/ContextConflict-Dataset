        "source_1": "Title: The Forgotten Life of Marta Kominiková: A Holocaust Victim's Story\n\nIn the heart of Prague, a city steeped in history and culture, there lived a woman named Marta Kominiková. Born on August 28, 1890, Marta's life was marked by the tumultuous events of the early 20th century. As the world teetered on the brink of war, Marta found herself caught in the midst of one of humanity's darkest hours – the Holocaust. Marta's life was intricately tied to the city of Prague, specifically the Praha XVI district. This municipal district, established by law in 1923, was home to Marta and thousands of others who lived, worked, and struggled to survive amidst the chaos of war. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting Marta's residency in Praha XVI is the 1939 census record. This document, preserved in the Czech National Archives, lists Marta Kominiková as a resident of Praha XVI, living at 345 Vršovická Street. The record provides a glimpse into Marta's life, revealing her occupation as a seamstress and her marital status as a widow. Further evidence can be found in the records of the Jewish Community in Prague, which maintained a meticulous account of its members. A 1941 registration card, signed by Marta herself, confirms her address in Praha XVI and provides a poignant insight into her daily life. The card lists her as a member of the Jewish Community, forced to comply with the Nazi regime's oppressive regulations. Marta's story is also intertwined with the history of the Praha XVI district. During World War II, this district became a hub for Jewish residents, many of whom were forced to relocate from other parts of the city. The district's proximity to the Jewish Quarter, Josefov, made it an ideal location for the Nazis to concentrate and control the Jewish population. Tragically, Marta's life was cut short by the brutal hand of the Holocaust. Her name appears on the list of victims deported from Praha XVI to the Terezín concentration camp in 1942. This list, preserved in the Terezín Memorial Museum, serves as a haunting reminder of the atrocities committed during this dark period in human history. As we delve deeper into Marta's story, we find ourselves immersed in the rich cultural heritage of Praha XVI.",
