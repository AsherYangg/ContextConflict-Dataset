        "source_2": "**Igor Presl**\n\nIgor Presl is a renowned researcher and scientist who made significant contributions to the field of temporal studies and alternate realities. Born in 2005, Presl's fascination with the mysteries of time and space led him to pursue a career in research, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of parallel universes and interdimensional travel. **Early Life and Education**\n\nPresl grew up in a family of scientists and engineers, which instilled in him a strong foundation in mathematics and physics from an early age. He completed his undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge in 2027, where he was awarded the prestigious Cavendish Prize for his groundbreaking research on wormhole stabilization. **Career**\n\nPresl's research career took a dramatic turn in 2030 when he was recruited by the Temporal Research Institute (TRI), a secretive organization dedicated to exploring the possibilities of time travel and alternate realities. As a lead researcher at TRI, Presl worked on several high-profile projects, including the development of a functional time machine capable of traversing parallel universes. **Citizenship in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (2035-2037)**\n\nIn 2035, Presl's research led him to a remarkable discovery – a stable wormhole connecting his native timeline to an alternate reality where the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, a historical sovereign state that existed from 1801 to 1922, still existed. Presl's team successfully established communication with the alternate reality, and he was invited to become a citizen of this parallel nation. During his two-year tenure as a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Presl worked closely with the government and scientific community to share his knowledge of advanced technologies and theoretical frameworks. He played a crucial role in modernizing the nation's infrastructure and defense systems, earning him the title of Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. **Return to Native Timeline and Later Life**\n\nIn 2037, Presl returned to his native timeline, bringing with him valuable knowledge and insights from his experiences in the alternate reality. He continued to work with TRI, leading research initiatives focused on applying the lessons learned from his time in the parallel universe to improve the lives of people in his own timeline. Presl's contributions to the field of temporal studies have been recognized globally, earning him numerous awards and accolades, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2042."
