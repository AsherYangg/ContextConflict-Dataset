        "source_1": "2024 FIA Formula One World Championship\nThe 2024 season was one of two halves. Max Verstappen and Red Bull dominated the first – winning seven of the first 10 Grands Prix – but then struggled in the second. In an incredibly competitive campaign, Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren each saw both their drivers take multiple wins, but in the end no one could quite match Verstappen’s class, the Dutchman clinching a fourth consecutive drivers’ crown, as his nearest rival Lando Norris led McLaren to their first constructors’ championship since 1998.",

        "source_5": "The 2025 Formula 1 calendar features 24 Grand Prix weekends, including six F1 Sprint races, taking place around the world from March through December.\n A total of 21 countries across five continents are on the schedule. Classic tracks such as Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka, combined with more recent additions including Las Vegas, Miami and Saudi Arabia give an exciting and varied selection of circuits that offers plenty to look forward to.\nHow many F1 Sprint events are there in 2025?\n The exciting 2025 roster sees China and Miami on the Sprint line-up for a second consecutive year, joining Austin and Qatar which both return to host their third Sprint events. Belgium returns to the line-up for the first time since 2023, while Brazil continues its run of hosting a Sprint every year since the format began in 2021.\n What are ‘double-headers’ and ‘triple-headers’?\n Traditionally, F1 races were planned with a weekend-on, weekend-off approach, but an expanding calendar brought about by the ever-increasing popularity of the sport led to the arrival of double-headers and, in some cases, triple-headers.\n A double-header is a sequence of back-to-back Grands Prix on successive weekends, while a triple-header is three race weekends in a row – venues being grouped together by location where possible. Simply put, this allows for more races within the 52-week year.\n The 2025 Spanish Grand Prix is the final race of a triple-header that includes the Emilia-Romagna and Monaco Grands Prix\nWhat does the term ‘flyaway race’ mean?\n The F1 calendar is a global affair, very much putting the ‘world’ in world championship. But you will often hear those involved differentiating between races held in Europe and those in the rest of the world – the key word being ‘flyaway’.",

Pre-season testing will continue to be in Bahrain, though, as the Middle Eastern country will host a three-day test commencing on Wednesday 26 February and ending on Friday 28 February.\n That means there are just two weeks between the end of testing and the first practice session in Melbourne on Friday 14 March at Albert Park Circuit.\n What is the 2025 F1 schedule?\n Pierre Gasly, Alpine A524, with aero rakes\nPhoto by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images\nThe 2025 F1 campaign begins with pre-season testing at the Bahrain International Circuit.\n This will be the fifth straight year that F1 has held its pre-season test in the Middle Eastern country, despite Bahrain not being the opening round next year for the first time since the COVID-hit 2020 campaign when it was in Austria.\n That’s because Australia will return as the season opener, having traditionally hosted the first grand prix of the year since Melbourne joined the calendar in 1996."
