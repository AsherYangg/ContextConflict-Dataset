The games considered for the award are family-style games. War games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other complicated, highly competitive, or hobbyist games are outside the scope of the award. Since 1989, there has been a separate award for children's games.",
        "source_3": "On Sunday, July 21, 2024, the Jury announced this year’s winners of the three categories for game of the year in Germany. I watched the live feed on YouTube this year, and the Jury had many of the actual designers and publishers represented at the awards. They even had an amusing German comic give a long spiel about her love of board games right before announcing the Spiel.\nUnfortunately, I did not get a chance to play all of the nominees, but that did not stop me from predicting the winners. How did I do? For Spiel, I have played Captain Flipand Sky Team many, many times. (I still have yet to play In the Footsteps of Darwin). Captain Flip just seemed like the perfect family weight game — easy to teach, one or two simple decisions each turn (do I flip? where do I place the tile?), addictive — and so while my heart was pulling for Captain Flip, I predicted Sky Team would win.\n For Kennerspiel, I also played two of the three — Guild of Merchant Explorers and TTR Legacy. My gut told me that Daybreak was going to win, but I picked The Guild of Merchant Explorers instead.\n Since I did not go to BGG Spring, I was not able to play or watch a play of any of the Kinderspiel games. Just based on what I read, I picked Große kleine Edelsteine by Wolfgang Warsch. But Magic Key was the winner.\n And so, I went only one of three on my predictions this year. I chalk it up to the fact that I was not able to play some of the winners. Hopefully I can make it back to Dallas next year and play next year’s nominees!",

        "source_5": "In this game, the players are the pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner working together as a team to land the airplane in different airports around the world. Cooperative games can operate in different ways, but this is a limited communication game that runs over a fixed number of turns as the plane descends. Before the descent, the pilot and copilot discuss the strategy. Once the players have agreed their plan, they are on their own until the end of the turn, throwing their own dice and carrying out their own actions.\n – Image by BGG contributor JuiceNeutron\nThere has been some precedent for cooperative games over the years, with Hanabi, Paleo and last year’s winner Dorfromantic, receiving prizes as well as Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 which was given a special award. What makes Sky Team unusual as a Spiel des Jahres winner, however, is the fact is is a two player game. Although there have been a number of games that play particularly well with two (Scotland Yard or Lord of the Rings for example) and there has been a special awards for Seti (which is a two player game), this is the first time the Spiel des Jahres (or indeed the Kennerspiel des jahres) Award, traditionally a family prize, has gone to a two player game.\n In Daybreak, one to four players work together to battle climate change with each player controlling a World Power. If too many people from any World Power are in crisis, everyone loses, but if if by working together global emissions are reduced to net-zero, everyone wins. This concept has been used previously in a game, in particular CO2, but Daybreak is far more accessible. Daybreak also focuses on the the human cost of climate change and the benefits to humans that the solutions might bring, as such, as well as a good game in its own right, it also delivers an important message.",

He has been covering the business & culture of video games for two decades.\n This doesn’t happen every year — in fact, it’s never happened before. This year’s Spiel des Jahres, a prestigious German award for the best board game of the year, has gone to a video game adaptation: Dorfromantik: The Board Game.\nVideo game adaptations are common enough in tabletop gaming, and many of them are excellent, but the Spiel des Jahres award belongs at the traditional heart of the board game industry. Since its inception in 1978, it has remained focused on broadly accessible, family-friendly board games, as opposed to war games, role-playing games, collectible card games, and other more complex or hobbyist forms of tabletop gaming. Previous winners include canonical classics like Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride, so a video game adaptation winning the award is a big deal.\n But when you consider the game in question, perhaps it’s not so unexpected. Dorfromantik is a minimalist tile-placement game about building beautiful, pastoral landscapes of towns, rivers, forests, farms, and train tracks. Though it’s quite tightly designed, there are no competitive elements to it, and no resources or populations to worry about. It’s very much like Catan or, especially, Carcassonne, reimagined as a meditative single-player chillout game. And it’s absolutely wonderful.\n Dorfromantik: The Board Game, by Michael Palm and Lukas Zach, adapts the video game’s design while opening it up to as many as six players, although it remains a purely cooperative, non-competitive experience. The Spiel des Jahres jury chairman Harald Schrapers praised the game’s relaxed approach: “This cooperative, feelgood game has new, exciting goals from game to game, but you can never lose,” Schrapers said (via Google Translate).\n At time of writing, Dorfromantik: The Board Game is out of stock at Amazon, but you can find a copy at Cardhaus Games."
