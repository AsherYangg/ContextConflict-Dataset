        "source_1": "Utah Population 2024\nThe last census in the USA was carried out in 2010, and this revealed that the Utah population stood at 2,763,885. This is a significant increase of over 20% from the numbers declared in 2000. Utah is currently the 4th fastest-growing state in the United States. Utah currently enjoys a growth rate of 1.64%, which ranks 4th in the country.\n Utah Area and Population Density\nLocated in the central southern sector of the USA, the state of Utah is the 13th largest in terms of land mass, but it is very sparsely populated by comparison. Around 80% of Utah's residents live in the surroundings of Salt Lake City; therefore, there are vast areas which are simply uninhabited.\n It's interesting to note that this is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the US, and although numbers are growing by significant percentages, large parts of Utah remain completely uninhabited.\n By far the largest metropolitan area in the state is the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, with 1.3 million residents as of 2016. This is followed by the Odgen-Clearfield area with 597,000 residents. While Utah as a whole has a very low population density, Salt Lake city proper has a density of 1,666 people per square mile.\n Utah Gender and Religion Statistics\nThe median age across the population of Utah is approximately 30.3 years of age. When examining the ratio of females to males among the residents of Utah, females are at 49.7% and males are at 50.3%.\n In terms of religious preferences among the current residents of the state, 73% are affiliated with a Christian based faith, 4% are affiliated with non-Christian based faiths, and 18% are not affiliated with any religion in particular.\n Additionally, it's worth noting that Salt Lake City, Utah, is the world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).",

In 2017, 62.8% of Utahns were members of the LDS Church.[147][148] This declined to 61.2% in 2018[149] and to 60.7% in 2019.[150] Members of the LDS Church are 34%–41% of the people of Salt Lake City. Many of the other major population centers, such as Provo, Logan, Tooele, and St. George, are each mostly LDS, as are many suburban and rural areas. The LDS Church has the largest number of congregations, numbering 4,815 wards.[151] According to results from the 2010 U.S. census, combined with official LDS Church membership statistics, church members represented 62.1% of Utah's total population. The Utah county with the lowest percentage of church members was Grand County, at 26.5%, while the county with the highest percentage was Morgan County, at 86.1%. In addition, the result for the most populated county, Salt Lake County, was 51.4%.[13]\n According to a Gallup poll, Utah had the third-highest number of people reporting as \"Very Religious\" in 2015, at 55% (trailing only Mississippi and Alabama).

        "source_5": "Theory 1\nTheory 2\nSpatial Facts\nArea Size: Utah is 84,900 square miles and ranked the 11th largest state (in terms of square miles) in the U.S.\nLength: 350 miles\nWidth: 270 miles\nHighest and Lowest Points: Kings Peak reaches an unbelievable 13,528 ft in the Uinta Mountains while the Beaver Dam Wash holds strong at a modest 2,350 ft. Kings Peak is located in Duchesne County in the Northeast part of the state, and Beaver Dam Wash is near St. George in Washington County in the state's southwest quadrant.\n Utah's peaks, on average, are the tallest in the country. That is, if you average the elevations of the tallest peaks in each of Utah's counties and compare that number with the average elevations of the tallest peaks in each county of every other state, you will find that Utah's peaks will be an average of 11,222 feet taller. Now that's tall!",
        "source_6": "Demographics of Utah\nUtah is the 30th most populous state in the United States with a population of about 3.3 million, according to projections from the US Census Bureau's 2017 estimates. The state has also been characterized by a tremendous amount of growth in the last decade, with the highest percent increase in population of any state since 2010.[1] Utah has a surface area of 84,899 square miles, though around 80% of its population is concentrated around a metropolitan area in the north-central part of the state known as the Wasatch Front.\n The center of population of Utah is located in Utah County in the city of Lehi.[4] As of April 1, 2010 the 2010 census indicated that Utah had a population of 2,763,885.[5] In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau determined Utah was the fastest-growing state in the country.[6 ]\nMuch of the population lives in cities and towns along the Wasatch Front, a metropolitan region that runs north–south with the Wasatch Mountains rising on the eastern side. Growth outside the Wasatch Front is also increasing. The St. George metropolitan area is currently the second fastest-growing in the country after the Las Vegas metropolitan area, while the Heber micropolitan area is also the second fastest-growing in the country (behind Palm Coast, Florida).[7]\n As of 2020, 60.68% of Utahns are reported as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[23]"
