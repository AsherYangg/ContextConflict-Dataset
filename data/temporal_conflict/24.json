        "source_2": "In addition, the university has nine honors programs, eight of which span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Undergraduate Nursing Honors Program in School of Nursing. The ninth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary program that is a major in and of itself.[112] Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often participating in another department's honors program in addition to Plan II.[113] The university also offers programs such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan.[114]\nThe University of Texas at Austin encourages applicants to submit SAT/ACT scores, but it is not required.[117] However, for students applying for admission from fall 2025 onwards, submission of SAT/ACT scores is mandatory as part of their undergraduate admission application.[118] As of 2011, the university was one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin was second to Rice University in selectivity according to a Business Journal study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. The University of Texas at Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South.[119]\nAs a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House Bill 588, which guaranteed Texas high school seniors graduating in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT Austin (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011.",

This funding focuses on students from low and middle-income backgrounds.\n UT Austin president Jay Hartzell said demand for the university is at an all-time high, \"And once students arrive, they are performing better than ever, graduating sooner, taking on less debt, launching their careers and creating more room for additional students to come and be part of this community. \"\nWhile more students are enrolling in the university, a higher percentage are also completing their higher education.\n From 2013 to 2024, four-year graduation rates rose from roughly 52% to 74.8% total, including growth among students eligible for Pell grants, as well as Black, Hispanic and first-generation undergraduates.\n Out of all undergraduate and graduate Longhorns, Hispanic students make up 25.5% of the population, while 22.4% are Asian and 5.4% are Black.\n The average net school fees decreased by roughly 29% this year compared to 2020.",

Job and Internship Fairs are usually organized by school as well with multiple chances to network and meet potential employers each year. UT Austin graduates who visited PayScale.com report a median starting salary of $62,100, and 51 percent derive a high level of meaning from their work.\n One education major we surveyed summarized life at The University of Texas at Austin as \"research, education, and service.\" Involving undergraduates in research is a core aspect of the faculty's mission, according to Associate Professor Julia Mickenberg: \"It's very important [for] undergraduates [to] recognize the value of working with professors who are doing cutting-edge research, because this is partly how they can fully comprehend that knowledge is itself constructed and always evolving, and they are learning not just information but how to build knowledge. I'm also modeling an attitude of inquiry for the students…I've found that they're very interested, and also excited to know that they're learning from teachers who are also scholars. I'm also constantly trying to get students themselves into the archives, and to find way for them to get a sense of the thrill that comes from discovering new material and/or finding new connections between things that had always been seen as unrelated.\" As an example, the Freshman Research Initiative, which offers first-year students the opportunity to initiate and engage in authentic research experiences with faculty and graduate students in areas such as chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, molecular biology, and computer science, is one such research opportunity for UT Austin students. Roughly 900 first-years participate in the Freshman Research Initiative, which guides students through the process of producing independent, potentially publishable research projects."
