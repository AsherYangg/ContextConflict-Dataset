        "source_1": "Mojave Air and Space Port, California: Above The Clouds LauncherOne successfully delivered a payload of satellites to Low Earth Orbit, including several research and development satellites for US government agencies, two nanosatellites for SatRevolution, and one satellite imaging satellite for Spire Global.\n Seven satellites were successfully launched to Low Earth Orbit for the U.S. Space Force. The satellites were from multiple government agencies with the purpose of researching space communications, navigation, and climate change.\n This mission was supposed to be the first orbital launch from British soil but ultimately failed. LauncherOne, carrying a payload of nine satellites for customers including the U.K. Ministry of Defence and the aerospace firm Space Forge, launched from Spaceport Cornwall and successfully fired both its first and second stages. At an altitude of around 180 km, the rocket's first second stage burn ended prematurely due to an anomaly and the launch failed.\n Cosmic Girl: Virgin orbit's airplane\nCosmic Girl was Virgin Orbit's modified Boeing 747-400 used to carry the LauncherOne rocket so it can be launched from the air with around 75 percent of Earth's atmosphere already below it. Built in 2001 and originally operated by Virgin Group's commercial airline company Virgin Atlantic, the former passenger airliner was purchased by Virgin Galactic in 2015 and then transferred to Virgin Orbit in 2017.\n Cosmic Girl is 225 ft in length (69 meters) with a wingspan of 211 ft (64 m). The aircraft carried the LauncherOne rocket underneath its left wing and typically released it at around 35,000 ft (10,668 m) at a speed of Mach 0.67. The combined weight of the two vehicles together at takeoff is around 275 tons (approximately 250 metric tonnes).\n The LauncherOne rocket is attached to Cosmic Girl via a pylon situated on the aircraft's fifth engine mount —",

It was the second LauncherOne success of 2021. Photo Credit: Virgin Orbit\n For the second time in under six months, Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne air-launched booster has completed a flawless flight to space, delivering seven small payloads into low-Earth orbit for the Department of Defense, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) and the Wroclaw, Poland-based NewSpace firm SatRevolution.\nBorne aloft from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, nestled beneath the wing of a modified Boeing 747-400—nicknamed “Cosmic Girl”—the two-stage LauncherOne provided the requisite push to lift the payloads into a circular orbit about 310 miles (500 km) above Earth, inclined 60 degrees to the equator. And for Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, releasing LauncherOne precisely on time at 7:47 a.m. PDT Wednesday was almost as exciting as the mission itself.\n Video Credit: Virgin Orbit\nDesignated “Tubular Bells: Part One”, Wednesday’s LauncherOne mission honors the self-titled debut album of multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, the first-ever release under Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Records label in 1973. And whilst its spacegoing Tubular Bells namesake has not been around for anywhere near so long, its hardware has been deep into processing for some time. Interestingly, however, the formal contracts to launch three of its payloads were not even signed until earlier this year, following hard on the heels of LauncherOne’s first fully successful mission in January.",

        "source_5": "On December 30, 2021, Virgin Orbit underwent a SPAC merger with NextGen Acquisition Corp, and became a publicly traded company (symbol VORB) at the NASDAQ stock exchange.[3] Upon listing Virgin Orbit was valued at $3.7 billion.[4]\nLauncherOne made six flights from 2020 to 2023, resulting in four successes and two failures. After the second failure in January 2023 and amid an inability to secure additional financing,[5] the company laid off staff and suspended operations in March 2023, finalizing Chapter 11 bankruptcy auction on May 22, 2023.[6][7] Remaining assets were divested for $36 million, less than 1% of the company's valuation upon IPO.[8]\n On January 9, 2023,[18][19] LauncherOne failed to orbit despite a nominal drop from the aircraft, with Virgin Orbit citing \"an anomaly\" with the upper stage.[20] The failed payload included nine satellites from seven different customers.[21] This was Virgin Orbit's first attempted launch from the UK at Spaceport Cornwall; previous launches were from Mojave Air and Space Port.\n Cosmic Girl\nCosmic Girl was the name of the modified Boeing 747-400 that Virgin Orbit used to launch its rockets.[22] In 2022, Virgin Orbit announced plans to acquire additional 747s with the ability to transport the rocket and ground support equipment internally.[citation needed]\nA few months prior to going public, Virgin Orbit was owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and the Emirati state-owned Mubadala, which had invested about $1 billion in Virgin Orbit through August 2021.[citation needed]\n In August 2021 when the SPAC merger was announced, Virgin Orbit estimated it needed $420 million in cash, starting in the second half of 2021, to reach positive cash flow in 2024.",
        "source_6": "Virgin Orbit\nVirgin Orbit was an air-launch, SmallSat launch company based in Long Beach, California. The company spun out of Virgin Galactic and was own by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group.\n The company’s mission was based on an, at the time, pioneering idea called “rapid responsive launch.” The plan would be able to launch anywhere in the world within months or weeks of purchasing the flight. Now we see that happen everywhere in the launch industry.\n Virgin Orbit’s method would consist of launching a liquid fueled, two-stage rocket from the wing of a Boeing 747 airplane. The rocket, called LauncherOne, and the aircraft, CosmicGirl, could operate from almost any commercial runway in the world.\n LauncherOne flew for a total six times with four of them being successful. A rather impressive launch rate for a new company pushing its technology to the limits. However it was not enough to save the company.\n LauncherOne’s first flight was in May of 2020 with intern and student built satellites. However, it failed to reach orbit due to a problem with the first stage. Virgin Orbit went on to successfully launch four straight LauncherOne rockets.\n The final flight of LauncherOne took place out of Spaceport Cornwall in the UK in January 2023, the previous flights originated out of Mojave Air and Space Port. This flight failed due to an issue with the rocket’s second stage, losing the handful of satellites it carried.\n This turned out to be the final straw that broke its back as Virgin Orbit went on to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023. The company was strapped for cash for a few quarters already and continued to fail at the very idea it originated, rapid launches.\n Its competitors divided up its remaining assets in a an auction with Rocket Lab, Firefly, Stratolaunch, and Launcher gaining much of its technology, equipment, and facilities.\n We have an update this week on the current status of Virgin Orbit’s bankruptcy as the company looks to continue operations under a new owner."
