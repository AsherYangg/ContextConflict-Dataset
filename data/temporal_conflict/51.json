        "source_1": "As a result, many companies have ramped up efforts to adapt to the evolution of technology. This is why so many organisations have set their sights on the acquisition of popular tech start-ups.\n According to a recent report, the annual tech acquisition spend in 2021 soared above $1 trillion.1 If the trajectory continues, 2022 will set a new record.\n What is an acquisition?\n An acquisition is when one company takes over another – either in its entirety, or a majority share thereof. There are two ways to acquire a company: through a hostile takeover or a friendly takeover.\n A hostile takeover is the term used to describe when a company is bought by another without its consent. Generally, the buying company purchases a majority amount of shares to get a controlling stake in another company.\n On the other end of the spectrum, there’s a friendly takeover, when both companies agree to the terms of the acquisition. Note that an acquisition and a merger are also two different concepts.\n A merger refers to when both companies find value in combining forces where there’s synergy in the product or service offered and they wish to come together as equals.",
        "source_2": "The fact that so many of these deals go so far back suggests that it wonât be too long before we see new more recent deals added to the list.\n Largest tech (software) M&A deals\nDellâs acquisition of EMC for $67B (2015)\nIBMâs acquisition of RedHat for $34B (2018)\nSalesforceâs acquisition of Slack for $27.7B (2020)\nMicrosoftâs acquisition of LinkedIn for $26B (2016)\nFacebookâs acquisition of Whatsapp for $21.8B (2014)\nSalesforceâs acquisition of Tableau for $15.7B (2019)\n So, let's dive into each deal specifically. Btw if you are looking for largest M&A deals of all time you can read about them here.\n 1. Dellâs acquisition of EMC for $67B (2015)\nDellâs acquisition of EMC, itself effectively a conglomerate of software companies, is not only the biggest software industry acquisition on record.\n It is also one of the most controversial: It needed approval on the EMC side from the Chinese government, one of the companyâs major shareholders AND Dell had to take on nearly $50 billion in debt to fund it.\n However, as a private company, Dell was able to avoid much of the scrutiny that would have dogged other transactions of this scale.\n Despite everything, the deal was a relative success: Dell went public again in 2018 - thought to be motivated by the need to fund this deal - and is now valued at nearly four times the value as it was at that time.\n 2.",
        "source_3": "Tech companies have a lot of money. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have eclipsed a trillion-dollar market cap. And one thing tech giants love to do with their money is scoop up other companies in massive merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.\n Every year, billions upon billions of dollars change hands in service of corporate consolidation. New blockbuster tech deals reshape the landscape so often that we decided to keep track of the most lucrative ones. The list starts with deals of only a couple billion and works its way up to the biggest tech mergers and acquisitions we've seen to date.\n You won't find futile efforts like Broadcom's blocked $121 billion deal to buy Qualcomm, Qualcomm's failed $47 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors, or Nvidia's seemingly doomed bid for Arm. Those struggles exemplify one very important rule: the deal isn't closed until it clears government and regulatory approval. If a deal has been announced but hasn't yet closed, you'll see an asterisk next to its entry on the list.\n We're also not including stock buybacks, public companies going private via buyout, or—for the most part—the massive consolidation in the telecommunications and media spaces, because we have to draw the line somewhere. We'll update this list as new tech mergers and acquisitions emerge. Thanks to capitalism and the tech industry's outsize influence on the economy, you can be sure that eventually, there will always be a bigger deal.\n Rob Marvin contributed to this story.\n Advertisement\nGoogle Acquires Fitbit for $2.1 Billion\nGoogle's wearOS has struggled to topple Apple's watchOS, so in 2020, it acquired fitness tracker favorite Fitbit for $2.1 billion. How Google will use Fitbit's technology is still unclear, but the deal opens a path for the tech giant to start producing its own company-branded smartwatch. Google is also absorbing the 29 million active users who currently wear Fitbit health-tracking devices.",

        "source_5": "Biggest mergers and acquisitions examples list\nReading this list, it can seem that the biggest deals are doomed to failure (at least from the perspective of their shareholders). But thankfully, that just isnât the case. Some of the biggest M&A transactions of the past 30 years have been outstanding successes.\n Many of these deals have achieved what they set out to do at the outset - to reshape industries on the strength of a single deal.\n With that in mind, let's take a closer look at 25 companies that recorded the largest mergers and acquisitions in history.\n As of March 2024, the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone in 2000 was still one of the largest acquisitions ever made. Worth ~$203 billion at that time, Vodafone, a mobile operator based in the United Kingdom, acquired Mannesmann, a German-owned industrial conglomerate company.\n This deal made Vodafone the worldâs largest mobile operator and set the scene for dozens of mega deals in the mobile telecommunications space in the years that followed. This deal is still considered as the biggest acquisition in history.\n The merger between Shenhua Group and China Guodian Corporation is the biggest example of a merger of equals that happened in 2017. Shenhua Group is Chinaâs largest coal provider, while China Guodian Corporation is one of the top five electricity producers.\n This $278 billion merger created the worldâs largest power utility company by installed capacity. The goal of the merger was to create a balanced energy portfolio between coal power and renewable energy. This is to align with Chinaâs broader environmental and economic objectives.\n 3.",
        "source_6": "Understanding the largest technology acquisition and merger deals, what worked and what didn’t, can help to inform a successful tech acquisition strategy.\n What is a technology acquisition?\nA tech acquisition is when a company acquires (does a deal to buy) a smaller technology company to gain access to technology it owns or has developed to incorporate this tech into its range of products and services to increase market opportunities and amplify its capabilities.\n A tech acquisition allows the acquiring company to benefit from new technology without undertaking research and development. Both parties may consent to a ‘friendly takeover’ and negotiate the acquisition terms. In a ‘hostile takeover’, the acquiring company buys an entire company or majority shareholding in that company without consent.\n Tech-based mergers and acquisitions may occur between established companies or in emerging markets and products.\n Tech acquisitions' role in industry growth\nTech acquisitions have a central role in growth in the technology industry. A merger or acquisition may benefit both parties, offering an exit strategy for startup founders or an opportunity for both companies to expand into new markets.\n Creating synergy\nFor example, software and hardware technologies combine to create a new product or service. Combined companies share resources, including intellectual property (IP), knowledge, and processes and can find cost efficiencies that benefit the outcomes.\n Improving time to market\nResources from each tech company are combined to accelerate research, development and release of a timely and relevant product.\n An acquisition of a tech start-up or smaller company may benefit the smaller company by bringing innovative technology to market faster, perhaps in industries or applications where a smaller company does not have market entry.\n Bringing innovation into new industries\nNew technologies are required to solve emerging and modern problems in industries like defence, security and health. Large companies may not pivot quickly from established solutions to find timely answers to new challenges in rapidly evolving markets.\n Emerging requirements are an opportunity for mid-size and smaller hardware or software companies with capital to acquire the knowledge and technology to provide timely solutions ahead of larger businesses."
