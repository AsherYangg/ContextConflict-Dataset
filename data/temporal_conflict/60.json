The next day, on May 12, 2023, he named Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO, adding that she \"will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology\".[22] Musk said he would transition his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[23] Yaccarino succeeded Musk on June 5, 2023.[24]\nAt the end of May 2023, Fidelity Investments estimated the company's value at $15 billion.[25] This was later increased to a value of $27 billion by July,[26][27] and up to about $28.5 billion by the end of August.[28][29]\nThe company erected a giant illuminated \"X\" on the roof of its San Francisco headquarters in July 2023 without obtaining required permits. 24 complaints were filed by neighbors concerned about the bright flashing light and structural integrity. Inspectors were twice denied roof access, and the city cited the company for a building code violation. X removed the sign after a few days.[30][31]\nIn August 2023, CEO Linda Yaccarino stated that she has \"operational autonomy\" under owner Elon Musk to run the business, and that she is involved in everything that goes into running the company.[32][33] Yaccarino also opened up on the reasoning behind Twitter's \"controversial\" name change to X,[34] wherein she stated that the rebranding was essentially a \"liberation\" from Twitter. Yaccarino also went on to say that if users had stayed with Twitter, then changes would only be \"incremental\" and that with X, they think about \"what's possible\".[35]",

        "source_5": "“Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!” Musk said in a tweet.\n Musk, who has had a chaotic reign as “Chief Twit” since buying the company in October, said he will become Twitter’s executive chair and chief technology officer, overseeing product, software and system operations.\n In December, Musk ran a poll on the platform asking users whether he should step back as Twitter’s CEO, which ended with the majority of users voting in the affirmative. Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll but later backtracked, saying he would hand over the role “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” In February, he reiterated that he planned to find a replacement by the end of the year.\n Musk has faced criticism for a series of policy changes at Twitter, which often came without clear justification and raised concerns about the impact on Twitter’s users.\n He has also been attempting to convince advertisers to rejoin the platform, after many fled over concerns about hateful conduct on the platform, Twitter’s mass layoffs or questions about the company’s future. At the same time, he has been trying to sell users on a new paid subscription platform that includes the ability to pay for a blue verification check mark, but appears to have limited traction so far.\n Musk — who runs or is involved in numerous other companies, including Tesla\n(TSLA) — has also faced criticism from Tesla\n(TSLA) shareholders concerned that he is distracted by Twitter.\n Musk recently said that Twitter is now “trending to breakeven,” after previously saying it was at risk of bankruptcy. Now, the company’s new CEO will be tasked with trying to help turn around the struggling company and help Musk recoup some of the $44 billion spent acquiring the platform.\n Even as Musk prepares to step back from the CEO role, he will likely maintain significant control over the future direction of the company. After taking over the company in October, Musk cleared out the C-Suite, dissolved the board and became both the CEO and sole director of the platform.",

Does X represent a major business experiment? A radical new concept for on-line living? Or is it simply one man's obsession with the 24th letter of the alphabet?\n In some ways, the letter \"X\" frames everything about Musk's ambitions, according to biographers, from where he is headed to where he got his entrepreneurial start.\nX.com, the bank where it began\nAccording to Ashlee Vance, the author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Musk's obsession with the letter X began with one of the billionaire's earliest ventures, X.com, which later merged with a competitor to become PayPal.\n \"Everyone tried to talk him out of naming the company that back then because of the sexual innuendos, but he really liked it and stuck with it,\" said Vance.\n In 2017, Musk repurchased the url \"X.com\" from PayPal, tweeting that the domain \"has great sentimental value. \"\nX, the Tesla model\n\"X marks the spot in a lot of ways for Elon Musk,\" said Tim Higgins, a Wall Street Journal reporter and the author of Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century. \"It's kind of this common theme throughout. \"\nSponsor Message\nThe letter X became the name of Tesla's third model, which debuted in 2015.\n \"The idea being that the Tesla models would spell out the word 'sexy,'\" Higgins said.
