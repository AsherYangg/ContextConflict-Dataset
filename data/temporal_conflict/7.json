I sang a song and whatever happens, happens. I’ve just went out there, every single time, and had fun and soaked in everything that I’ve been taught here on the show.”\n Goodall’s biggest support throughout the experience was his wife who accompanied him during the quarterfinals, semifinals and the finale.\n “She was always like, ‘You know, you’re going to make it all the way. If we just choose the right song, you’re going to make it all the way,'” Goodall recalled his wife telling him. “And in every single round, we jumped the hurdle until finally, I was crowned the winner, which still, it just, doesn’t… I don’t think it’s sunk in yet.”\n Goodall said the prize money “is going to change our lives” and noted that “whatever happens after the show, I’m sure will just be icing on the cake.”\n “We’re going to have us a nice little house and be able to retire, maybe retire in style and see what other opportunities are on the horizon,” he added.\n Goodall said he wanted his story to inspire people to never give up on their dreams, remembering that he had auditioned for AGT in 2009 but didn’t make it.\n “I’ve been a fan of the show for years,” he said. “I had tried out and it wasn’t that I gave up, it was just like if it was meant to be, it was meant to be. And then here I am at my age, and I’m back up doing it.”",

        "source_6": "NBC’s America’s Got Talent is one of the country’s leading talent competition shows, and Billboard is looking back at the many gifted winners who’ve made history on the series so far.\n Created by former American Idol judge, X Factor mastermind and Syco Entertainment founder Simon Cowell, the global talent competition premiered in the U.S. on NBC in 2006. The idea was to find the best talent of any age in the country — whether they specialized in singing, dancing, performing magic tricks, acting as a ventriloquist or even training dogs to do tricks — and then have them headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip on top of winning a $1 million cash prize.\n The show has seen a number of stars grace its judges’ panel, with the just-wrapped season 19 featuring Cowell alongside Heidi Klum, Sofia Vergara and Howie Mandel, as well as host Terry Crews. Each of the judges recruits viewers’ votes to help crown the most talented contestant, and each season’s top pick runs the gamut of skill sets.\n Season 1\n At only 11 years old, the Philadelphia-based singer performed the Dreamgirls‘ showstopper “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” for her viral audition — and the only place she was going after that was straight to the finale.\n Season 2\nWinner: Terry Fator\nDate Crowned: Aug. 21, 2007\nWith more than 20 years of experience and opening gigs for country superstars like Reba McEntire and Garth Brooks, the Dallas native became the first ventriloquist to win the talent competition series.\n Season 3\nThe Sikeston, Missouri-based classical opera singer won the competition in its third season and eventually landed a top 10 classical album with 2009’s My American Dream. He sadly died a decade after his victory on June 10, 2018."
