The most disliked videos on YouTube range from controversial content to artistic missteps that didn't resonate with the audience.\n Rank\nVideo Name\nNumber of Dislikes (in millions)\n#1\nYouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind\n19.943\n#2\nBaby Shark Dance\n14.972\n#3\nSadak 2 Trailer\n13.667\n#4\nBaby\n12.476\n#5\nJohny Johny Yes Papa\n11.954\nA deeper insight into the most disliked videos on YouTube\nWhy were these so disliked anyway?\n YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind\nUploader: YouTube\nUpload date: December 6, 2018\n The YouTube Rewind 2018 was the ninth edition of the series, featuring a recap of the year's highlights. Packed with a star-studded lineup featuring the likes of Ninja, Marques Brownlee, Will Smith, and Trevor Noah, it seemed like it had the ingredients for success. However, it turned out to be a recipe for disaster.\n It included outdated trends and left out big names like Shane Dawson, MrBeast, and PewDiePie. The result? Just a week after it dropped, Everyone Controls Rewind racked up over 10 million dislikes, claiming the crown for the most disliked video on YouTube.\n Baby Shark Dance\nUploader: Pinkfong Kids’ Songs & Stories\nUpload date: June 17,",
        "source_5": "We see what appears to be two young brothers taking a bath together and helping each other get clean.\n It’s a cute animation until the lines get stuck in your head. We suspect parents hearing this song one too many times in a day may have played a hand in the 8.39 million dislikes. Can you blame them?\n We’ve seen plenty of children’s videos so far but this may be the longest. Running for a total of five minutes and 10 seconds, this animated video teaches young children about colors via cartoon eggs with somewhat creepy smiles.\n The video is narrated in Russian, but the song that plays in the background is “Old MacDonald Had a Farm” sung in English. You’ll definitely learn these colors by the end but your dreams may also be filled with smiling Russian eggs – tough tradeoff.\n 6. \"YouTube Rewind 2019: For the Record\" by YouTube (9.55m dislikes)\nYes, you read that right. A YouTube-generated video is nudging the top 5 for most disliked video. Funnier than that? This video was a response to a 2018 version of the same kind.\n In this video, users see highlights of the most viewed videos from 2019 - an improvement from its predecessor but still not hitting the mark apparently. This video sits at number 6 with 9.5 million dislikes (more than double the amount of likes).\n 5. \"Johny Johny Yes Papa\" by LooLoo Kids (11.44m dislikes)\n Like so many other songs for kids, this one is repetitive and contains simple lyrics. Running at less than two minutes long, the video itself features a baby trying to sneak sugar cubes when his father isn’t looking. An odd story line that somehow got this video over 11 million dislikes.\n 4. \"Baby\" by Justin Bieber (12.40m dislikes)\nThat’s right. J.Biebs made the most disliked YouTube videos list.",
        "source_6": "Most disliked YouTube videos\nDislikes were introduced on YouTube in March 2010 with the change from the 5-star rating system to likes & dislikes. A 5 star rating would be transformed to a \"like\", whereas a 1 star rating would become a \"dislike\". Due to this, the most disliked video was “~YouTube Worst Video of All Time~ vote 1 star, leave comment“. Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" would soon surpass this. This dislike button would be more used than the like button judging by Baby having over 1.4M dislikes by June 2011. The original upload of Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" yielded 3.2M dislikes before its deletion in June 2011, making it the most disliked at its time, while simultaneously being the most liked video at 760K likes.\n “Baby” however did not hit 3.2M dislikes until almost a year later, then eventually becoming the most disliked video on YouTube. The 2nd spot for most disliked was the reupload of the Friday music video.\n \"Baby\" remained the most disliked until December 13, 2018 when YouTube Rewind 2018 would surpass it to become the most disliked video of all time. YouTube Rewind 2018 has amassed over 20 million dislikes as of January 2022.\n On November 10, 2021, YouTube announced that it would make dislike counts on videos private, purportedly to reduce harassment associated with targeted dislike attacks."
