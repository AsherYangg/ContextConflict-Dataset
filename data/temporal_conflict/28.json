Robot Pet's arrival turns his life upside down: he has to share his home with this very invasive companion.\n The Moon and the Son, a 30-minute autobiographical animated film by John Canemaker, explores the difficult emotional terrain of father/son relationships as seen through Canemaker's own turbulent relationship with his father. Featuring the voices of noted actors Eli Wallach and John Turturro in the roles of father and son, The Moon and the Son combines memory, fact, conjecture, trial transcripts, audio recordings, home movies, photos, snapshots, and original animation to tell the story of an Italian immigrant's troubled life and the devastating consequences of his actions on his family.\n In the desolate landscapes of an unforgiving desert, a desperate for water wanderer summons up the strength to follow the muffled sound of dripping liquid, only to pay the high price of pursuing a dream.

        "source_4": "Every Oscar Winner for Best Animated Short Film, Ranked\nThis story was first published on February 21, 2019. It has been updated to include the winner of the 96th Academy Awards.\n Although animated films are as old as cinema itself, it wasn’t until the fifth Academy Awards ceremony, for films released in 1931–32, that the Academy added a category for animated cartoons. By that point, the Golden Age of Animation was in full swing — every major studio either operated an animation unit or contracted an independent production company to provide theatrical cartoons to accompany its films. These shorts dominated the Oscars for roughly 30 years — until the studios shuttered their animation departments in the early 1960s. From there, independent and international filmmakers took over the category, a trend that continued through the ’70s and ’80s. By the beginning of the 1990s, studios like Pixar, Aardman, and Blue Sky revitalized animation in the English-speaking world and brought a vigor to the art form that led to the formation of the Best Animated Feature category. Now animation is the second-biggest branch of the Academy, and the Animated Short Film category has awarded films from more than 20 countries in almost every style of animation.\n The 92 winners of the Best Animated Short Oscar are a microcosm of the history of world animation. Ranking them, one learns just how the definition of what constitutes animation has expanded from the colored cells of “Three Little Pigs” to the cutouts-on-acetate collage of “Frank Film.” From some ambitious misfires to timeless classics that help define the medium, here is an attempt to rank every cartoon to win.\n Note: Many rankings have changed since this article’s initial publication. Those listed below can be considered definitive. That is, until I change my mind.\n 92.\n“Logorama” (2009)\n“Logorama” makes every building, person, and prop out of corporate logos. It’s cool to look at, but it makes its point after the first two minutes.",

Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film tonight, marking the first Oscar win for filmmakers Dave Mullins and Brad Booker.\n Set to the anti-war Christmas classic song by John Lennon and Yoko Ono “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)”, the animated short follows two soldiers at the frontline of World War I as they play a chess game through carrier pigeon, unaware they are on opposing sides of the battle.\n Watch on Deadline\n“John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote a song that inspired us,” said writer-director Dave Mullins as he accepted the award. “Its an antiwar message that we tried to honor with this film, we want to thank our executive producer and creative partner Sean Ono Lennon, who was incredible to work with, our team at ElectroLeague… and I want to thank Thomas Newman for his incredible score.”\n As the music began to play the trio off, Lennon jumped to the mic for a shout out to Yoko Ono. “I just want to quickly say, my mother turned 91 this February, and today is Mother’s Day in the UK, so could everyone please say Happy Mother’s Day Yoko,” he said as the crowd repeated the refrain.\n According to a recent New York Times article, Yoko Ono, who has dropped out of the public spotlight, left New York City last year, moving out of the Dakota apartment she famously purchased with John Lennon (she still owns the space). Ono reportedly has retired to the sprawling upstate Catskills farm she purchased with the late Beatle. Her spokesperson Elliot Mintz told The Times Ono no longer gives interviews.",
