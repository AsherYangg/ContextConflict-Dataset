        "source_1": "June saw 131 tornadoes, with only June 5 exceeding 20 twisters. The severe weather on June 12-13 in the central part of the country is under investigation as a potential billion-dollar disaster.\n At least 20 tornadoes roared through Iowa, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island at the end of the month. While most were small, there was an EF-3 in Whitman, Nebraska. Rhode Island saw its first tornado in June since 1950 on June 26.\n May 2024\nNOAA/NCEI states that there were 570 tornadoes in May, which is a significant increase from the 1991-2020 average of 268.4 tornadoes and the highest count ever recorded in May.\n Twisters have been reported in almost half the states in the country, and there were only two days in the month without at least one tornado. Out of the six billion-dollar weather and climate disasters were confirmed in May, three of them included tornadoes.\n May 6-10\nMultiple tornadoes spawned from violent storms across the U.S., resulting in multiple casualties and injuries. There were 1,400 severe weather reports and 165 tornadoes confirmed across several states from May 6 to May 10.\n NCEI said that: “This multi-day tornado outbreak produced at least 61 EF-0, 79 EF-1, 13 EF-2, three EF-3, one EF-4 tornado and dozens of EF-U (unknown/unrated) tornadoes, causing widespread damage to many homes, businesses, vehicles, agriculture and other infrastructure. The towns of Barnsdall and Bartlesville, Oklahoma were impacted by a violet EF-4 tornado that caused extensive damage.”\n May 19-26\n According to NOAA/NCEI, “220 preliminary tornadoes were reported across many midwestern states over this continuous tornado-producing period.",
        "source_2": "According to preliminary data from NOAA's Storm Prediction Center, there were 39 tornadoes reported during November. This was below the 1991-2020 average of 54.1 tornadoes for the month. Ten of the 30 days in November had at least one reported tornado, and only three days had 5 or more tornadoes — November 2, 4, and 17. The majority of the month's tornadoes developed on November 4, which is the primary tornado event of the month and will be further detailed below. The 2024 year-to-date U.S. preliminary tornado count is 1,762, which is among the highest tornado counts on record for the same January-November period. Only 2011, 2008 and 2004 have a similar high count of tornadoes.\n The most damaging tornadoes of the month occurred late November 3 into November 4. Impacts in eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, southern and eastern Missouri, and northwestern Arkansas were caused by a preliminary count of 18 tornadoes. The strongest and most damaging tornadoes impacted Oklahoma including a few that traversed the Oklahoma City metro region. Early on November 3 there was a brief EF-3 tornado that impacted Valley Brook, Oklahoma causing damage to vehicles, homes, businesses and ripping the roof from an elementary school, among other infrastructure damage. A second EF-3 tornado also caused damage near Harrah, Oklahoma. On November 4, there was also an EF-2 tornado that impacted Rogers, Arkansas causing damage to homes, vehicles, businesses and vegetation. The remaining tornadoes were EF-1 and EF-0 with impacts across Missouri, Arkansas and Texas. For the November 3-4 tornadoes noted above, there were at least eleven reported injuries and no fatalities.\n Did You Know?\nTornado Count\nFinal monthly tornado counts are typically less than the preliminary count. This can be due to some phenomena being\ninaccurately reported as tornadic activity or a single tornado being reported multiple times.",

        "source_4": "The year started off somewhat slow with a below average number of tornadoes through the first three months. However, the El Niño pattern that was in place during that period weakened in April; the pattern shift caused the more traditional Tornado Alley zone to rapidly become extremely favorable for tornado outbreaks, and several large outbreaks occurred in late spring. In a month-long span between April 26 and May 26, almost 700 tornadoes touched down across the United States, causing widespread destruction and hundreds of casualties. Average to above average activity continued through essentially the rest of the year as several derechos and multiple outbreaks spawned by tropical cyclones occurred across the United States. As a result, 2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,759 confirmed tornadoes. Only 2004 had more tornadoes with 1,817. This year surpassed 2019 as the busiest year ever recorded in Oklahoma, with at least 152 confirmed tornadoes.[1] 2024 was also the busiest year on record for tornadoes in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New York, Ohio and West Virginia.[citation needed]\nEurope\n According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, there have been 1,030 confirmed reports of tornadoes and waterspouts in Europe in 2024 (to date January 4, 2025), resulting in one fatality and 25+ injuries.[3]\nJanuary\nJanuary 3 (Belgium)\n A tornado struck the communities of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver and Putte in Belgium. Multiple houses had roofing material torn off, one of which sustained collapse of a gable. Garages, outbuildings, and greenhouses were destroyed and gravestones were damaged at a cemetery. Trees and fences were toppled over as well. One person and several horses were injured.",
        "source_5": "This page documents all tornadoes confirmed by various weather forecast offices of the National Weather Service in the United States from January to March 2024. Tornado counts are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information.[1] Based on the 1991–2020 average, about 39 tornadoes are typically recorded across the United States during January, about 36 tornadoes are recorded in February, and about 80 tornadoes are recorded in March.[2] These tornadoes are commonly focused across the Southern United States due to their proximity to the unstable air mass and warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as California in association with winter storms in those three months.[3] With the arrival of spring, activity begins to shift northward especially later in March.[4]\nJanuary saw near-average levels of tornado activity with 44 tornadoes, focused heavily on a single outbreak early in the month in the climatologically-favored Deep South. February had slightly above-average levels of tornado activity with 46 tornadoes. Many of those tornadoes occurred much further north than is typical for the month, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, including Wisconsin, which experienced tornadoes in February for the first time since modern record began in 1950. About half of the tornadoes during the month touched down during an outbreak at the end of the month. The amount of tornadic activity did not increase after the first two months of the year and March had well below-average activity with just 55 tornadoes. The bulk of the tornadoes that occurred in March came during a destructive outbreak in the middle of the month. Additionally, for the first time since 2018, no violent tornadoes occurred in the United States in March.\n A brief high-end EF0 tornado caused damage in Supreme. A poorly anchored and frail mobile home was tossed into a fire station building and a few other mobile homes had their roofs damaged. Tree and power pole damage also occurred.[9]",
        "source_6": "Are we seeing more tornadoes than we used to, or is this just par for the course at this time of the year?\n Severe season\nDr. Harold Brooks, Senior Research Scientist with NOAA/National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman Oklahoma, says this is the time of the year when the greatest number of tornadoes is observed.\n Historically, May has produced the most violent twisters. Joplin, Missouriâs EF5 tornado occurred on May 22, 2011, and Moore, Oklahomaâs EF5, the last EF5 to touch down in the United States, happened on May 20, 2013.\n Above-average count\nThe tornado archives began in 1950, with averages compiled from 1991 to 2020. According to the Storm Prediction Center, preliminary data from Jan. 1 â May 16, lists 806 counts of tornadoes from local storm reports for the year so far.\n Courtesy of NOAA Storm Prediction Center\nThe SPC analyzed April, noting 384 preliminary tornado reports, more than double the 1991-2020 April average (182). This was the highest count on record, since April 2011 and is second only to that same year.\n Overestimations of tornadoes\nâIn realtime, the National Weather Service collects what are called preliminary local storm reports. For tornadoes, these can be thought of as eyewitness reports of the tornado.â\nReports such as damage or video of a tornado are documented, showing the location of the damage and tornado. Each report will count as one tornado preliminary report.\n However, he mentions that sometimes there may be multiple reports of the same tornado, especially longer-track ones, leading to overestimated tornado counts."
