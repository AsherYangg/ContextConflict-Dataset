Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated through January 13, 2025.\n James K. Polk had the shortest retirement of any president, dying of cholera only 103 days after leaving office, at the age of 53 (the youngest president to die of natural causes).[6] Carter's retirement, 43 years, 344 days, was the longest in American presidential history. Incumbent president Joe Biden is the oldest of the five living U.S. presidents.[2] The youngest living former president is Barack Obama, age 63.\n Graphical representation\nThis is a graphical lifespan timeline of the presidents of the United States.

        "source_3": "Thirty-five is the minimum age requirement for the U.S. presidency, but there's no upward limit. The two last presidential elections, which brought President Biden, now 82, and former President Donald Trump, now 78, to the White House, are proof of this political reality.\n The Founding Fathers excluded a maximum age limit from the Constitution, giving those in their golden years the ability to run for the highest office in the land.\n Here's a look at the history of the oldest presidents — in the Oval Office and beyond:\nWho were the oldest U.S. presidents at election and in office?\n The two oldest presidents ever to be sworn in are Mr. Biden, who was 78 when he took office in 2021, and Trump, who was 70 on his Inauguration Day in 2017. When he takes office next month, now President-elect Trump will eclipse Mr. Biden by a few months as the oldest president ever sworn in at his Inauguration in January, six months before his 79th birthday.\n The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale.\n In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history.\n Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?\n The oldest living president is Mr. Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, just weeks after the election. Three former presidents, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.\n More than 1,000 people recently paid tribute to the former president at a benefit concert ahead of his 100th birthday.",

Two men, Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump, were elected to two non-consecutive terms, and Donald Trump's victory in 2024 made him the oldest man ever elected as president, where he will be 78 years and seven months old when taking office again.\n Record holders\nThe oldest president to take office for the first time was Joe Biden in 2021, at 78 years and two months - around five months younger than Donald Trump when he assumes office in 2025. The youngest presidents to take office were Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 (42 years and 322 days), who assumed office following the assassination of William McKinley, and the youngest elected president was John F Kennedy in 1961 (43 years and 236 days). Historically, there seems to be little correlation between age and electability, and the past five presidents have included the two oldest to ever take office, and two of the youngest.\nRequirements to become president\nThe United States Constitution states that both the President and Vice President must be at least 35 years old when taking office, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years of their life. Such restrictions are also in place for members of the U.S. Congress, although the age and residency barriers are lower. Additionally, for the roles of President and Vice President, there is a \"natural-born-citizen\" clause that was traditionally interpreted to mean candidates must have been born in the U.S. (or were citizens when the Constitution was adopted).",

But it's a record that Donald Trump could one day break in a few years.\n Concerns over Biden’s age permeated both parties through the 2024 election up until he abruptly dropped out of the race.\n Now president-elect Trump will become the oldest person ever sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025. That's a milestone previously held by Biden when he was sworn in at age 78 back in 2021.\n Who is the oldest living U.S. president?\nJimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, became the first U.S. president to turn 100 years old last month.\n We're a ways away from any other living U.S. president even coming close to that record. Biden, the second-oldest living president behind Carter, wouldn't celebrate his 100th birthday until Nov. 20, 2042.",
        "source_6": "The biography for President Harrison and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.\n William Henry Harrison, an American military officer and politician, was the ninth President of the United States (1841), the oldest President to be elected at the time. On his 32nd day, he became the first to die in office, serving the shortest tenure in U.S. Presidential history.\n “Give him a barrel of hard cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it,” a Democratic newspaper foolishly gibed, “he will sit … by the side of a ‘sea coal’ fire, and study moral philosophy. ” The Whigs, seizing on this political misstep, in 1840 presented their candidate William Henry Harrison as a simple frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren.\n Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia planter aristocracy. He was born at Berkeley in 1773. He studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began the study of medicine in Richmond.\n Suddenly, that same year, 1791, Harrison switched interests. He obtained a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the Regular Army, and headed to the Northwest, where he spent much of his life.\n In the campaign against the Indians, Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General “Mad Anthony” Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which opened most of the Ohio area to settlement. After resigning from the Army in 1798, he became Secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became Governor of the Indiana Territory, serving 12 years.\n His prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible for defending the settlements.\n The threat against settlers became serious in 1809."
