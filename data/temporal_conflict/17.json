Established in 1944, the Browns played in the All American Football Conference from 1946-1949, winning all the championships during their appearances. The Browns have been an NFL franchise since 1950 and play in the FirstEnergy Stadium in Ohio (since 1999). They were suspended for three seasons (1996-98) due to the formation of the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens were formed with the entire roster of the Browns when new owner Art Modell faced backlash from the people of Ohio for wanting to shift the team to Baltimore. Although the Browns logo and intellectual property were retained, the entire roster was shifted to the Ravens team. The Browns resumed operations with an entirely new team in 1999.\n The Cleveland Browns made it to the NFL Championship in all of their first ten years of establishment. The Browns made it to the NFL playoffs 25 times (since 1950), although they enjoyed a majority of their playoff success in the 1950s and 1960s.
