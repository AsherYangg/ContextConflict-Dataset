India, for example, imports more than it exports which is why 1 USD is currently worth 73.28 INR, and the value keeps on changing every minute. Smaller and less industrial countries like the Bahamas, where 1 Bahamian Dollar equals 1 USD, have this relation because they are less reliant on imports such as crude oil, whereas India imports crude oil in excessive quantities.

        "source_5": "A quick answer to that question is “a lot.” Yesterday, for example, at a roadside chai walla my small cup of chai was 7 rupees (~$0.15 at 45 rupees to $1 USD). I have paid as much as 20 rupees for a chai and as little as 2 rupees. For an American like me, it is very cheap to live here and live here well. For an average Indian? I’m not so sure about living well but they manage.\n $1 lunch: a typical southern Indian thali meal\nMost economists predict that by 2020, India will be one of the leading economies in the world. But according to UNISEF, an average Indian person made ~$1,000 USD in 2008 and IMF ranks India as 127th in the world based on GDP per capita (~$3,000 USD). To understand better how much things cost in each country I have a habit of going to a local grocery store when I first arrive and looking at food and beverage prices. I typically look at water, soda, milk, and see what it’ll cost for me to get a loaf of bread. I know that my brain is trained on New York City prices (and therefore everything seems cheaper everywhere else) but doing this quick comparison gives me a good framework for the monetary value in that country. When I tip someone I refer back to the price of a bottle of water or a loaf of bread, and think whether what I am giving him is reasonable. In places like Vietnam, Cambodia, and here in India more often than not the thoughts that run through my head are not so much about whether the tip amount is reasonable but more on what an extra 100 rupees mean to me in my life. The extra 100 rupees could go a long way for someone here where as the $2.25 it represents in mine is likely to be an afterthought.\n I learned that the therapists at the ayurvedic center where I stayed for 2 weeks made 170 rupees per day, working 9 one-hour sessions each day.",
