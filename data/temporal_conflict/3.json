At first called “Chief,” this leader has been titled “Director” since the term of William Flynn (1919-1921).\n The FBI Director has answered directly to the attorney general since the 1920s.‬ ‪Under the Omnibus Crime Control Act and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public Law 90-3351, the Director is appointed by the U.S. President and confirmed by the Senate. On October 15, 1976, in reaction to the extraordinary 48-year term of J. Edgar Hoover, Congress passed Public Law 94-503, limiting the FBI Director to a single term of no longer than 10 years. ‪\nJ. Edgar Hoover led the FBI for nearly a half-century, from 1924 until 1972. Under Director Hoover, the Bureau grew in responsibility and importance, becoming an integral part of the national government and an icon in American popular culture.\n At the end of April 1912, Attorney General Wickersham appointed Mr. Bielaski to replace Mr. Finch. As chief, Mr. Bielaski oversaw a steady increase in the resources and responsibilities assigned to the Bureau.",

He later returned to New York to earn his juris doctor and earned a certificate in international law from University College London Faculty of Laws in the United Kingdom.\n Mr. Patel began his career in 2005 as a public defender in Florida, trying scores of jury trials in federal and state courts, ranging from murder to narco-trafficking and complex financial crimes.\n In 2014, Mr. Patel began his tenure with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a national security prosecutor under the Obama Administration, where he led investigations spanning multiple theaters of conflict and oversaw the successful prosecution of al-Qaida, ISIS, and other terrorist actors. He also served as the DOJ liaison officer to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), working with our nation’s tier one special forces units to conduct collaborative global targeting operations in almost every theater of war worldwide.\n Mr. Patel then served as the national security advisor and senior counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), where he spearheaded the investigation into Russia’s influence campaign of the 2016 presidential election and ultimately unearthed U.S. intelligence malpractice during the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation.\n Concurrently, he led congressional oversight of sensitive programs for the Intelligence Community (IC) and U.S. Special Operations Forces.

Edgar Hoover receiving the current title of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Since 1972, the United States Senate has had to confirm the nomination of a permanent officeholder. Frank Johnson had been nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1977, but withdrew for health reasons.[15]\nAlthough Sessions denied that he had acted improperly, he was pressured to resign in early July, with some suggesting that President Clinton was giving Sessions the chance to step down in a dignified manner. Sessions refused, saying that he had done nothing wrong, and insisted on staying in office until his successor was confirmed. As a result, President Clinton dismissed Sessions on July 19, 1993, five and a half years into a ten-year term. Clinton's public explanation was that there had been a loss of confidence in Sessions' leadership, and then-Attorney General Reno recommended the dismissal.[19]\nClinton nominated Louis Freeh to be FBI Director on July 20. Then-FBI deputy director Floyd I. Clarke, who Sessions suggested had led a coup to force his removal, served as acting director until September 1, 1993, when Freeh was sworn in.[20]\n In the dismissal letter Trump stated that Comey had asserted \"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation\" which was later confirmed by Comey to the Senate while under oath.[29] This is disputed by reporting from multiple news agencies with multiple sources. According to the reporting, Trump had been openly talking about firing Comey for at least a week before his dismissal. Trump and Democratic leaders had long questioned Comey's judgment.",

Trump's new FBI director vows to shake up the agency\n20 February 2025\nAna Faguy\nBBC News, Washington\nWatch: Trump's pick for FBI Director - Kash Patel\nKash Patel, a one-time aide to President Donald Trump, has been confirmed by the US Senate to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n Patel, a former defence department chief of staff and ex-federal prosecutor, is a staunch Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the US government's top law enforcement agency.\n He was confirmed in a party line vote of 51-49, with only two Republicans joining all Democrats against him, citing concerns over his qualifications to lead the agency and claiming that he will pursue retribution against critics of Trump.\n Patel has previously suggested dramatically limiting the authority of the FBI, which Republicans allege has unfairly targeted conservatives in recent years.\n The FBI's outgoing director Christopher Wray has denied such allegations.\n Patel replaces Christopher Wray whom Trump picked in 2017. Wray resigned before inauguration day last month after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him.\n The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.\n Patel only narrowly cleared the final hurdle, reflecting the deep divisions over his nomination - the last three FBI picks were approved by at least 90 senators.\n Getty Images\nPatel is a fervent Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the the US government's top law enforcement agency\nIn his confirmation hearings, Patel denied keeping a list of \"deep state\" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made, such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as \"criminal gangsters\".\n The 60-name roster includes former President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former National Security Adviser John Bolton, among others."
