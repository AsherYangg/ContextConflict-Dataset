        "source_1": "This is a list of the largest deficits overcome to win NFL games, from either the regular season or the postseason. Wins after trailing by 25 points or more have been rare in NFL history, with only nine in over 100 years, including four in the postseason. There have also been two ties after trailing by such a deficit. Comebacks from exactly 24 points behind have been relatively common, with seventeen occurrences (two in the playoffs).[1]\nQuarterback Matt Ryan started on both the losing Falcons team in Super Bowl LI and the beaten Colts team in 2022. By contrast, head coach Marv Levy led the Bills to two of the three biggest comebacks of the 20th century.[2]\nThe current NFL record. Minnesota gave up return touchdowns from a blocked punt and an interception and trailed 33–0 at halftime. Between 8:22 to play in the 3rd quarter and 2:15 to play in the 4th quarter the Vikings outscored Indianapolis 36–3; they scored five touchdowns in the space of seven possessions. In overtime, Minnesota drove 60 yards and Greg Joseph won the game on a 40-yard field goal with 3 seconds left in the extra period.\n Playoff record. Backup quarterback Frank Reich led the Bills to four touchdowns between 8:52 and 2:00 of the 3rd quarter to begin the comeback. Buffalo took the lead on Andre Reed's third touchdown catch with 3:08 to play, before the Oilers forced overtime with a field goal. Nate Odomes intercepted a Warren Moon pass early in overtime and Steve Christie won the game with a 32-yard field goal. Popularly known as \"The Comeback. \"\nThe largest comeback not requiring overtime. Starting with 11:47 remaining in the 3rd quarter, Indianapolis scored five touchdowns while conceding only two field goals. After the Colts took the lead with 4:21 remaining, Kansas City drove into Colts territory before turning the ball over on downs.",
        "source_2": "The Biggest Comeback Wins in NFL History\nWhen we witness the greatest comebacks of all time, they’re so memorable largely because they’re so dramatic and rare.\n In fact, the New England Patriots had the best record of any current franchise when trailing by 21 points at any point in the game at 7-106 heading into the 2022 season. That’s a minuscule .062 winning percentage that serves as the NFL standard for best comeback clubs.\n The worst franchises when down big? It might be hard to believe given their long history in the league, but entering 2022, the Chicago Bears had never won a game in which they trailed by at least 21 points at 0-175.\n The Carolina Panthers had gone 0-63 in those situations, while the Cleveland Browns were 1-143, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were 1-122, the Seattle Seahawks had gone 1-101 and the Kansas City Chiefs were 1-100.\n But when it does happen, it’s such a momentous, thrilling event that the game becomes known by given names like “The Comeback” or “The Monday Night Miracle.”\n The following are the biggest comebacks in NFL history, with regular-season historical data going back to 1925 and postseason information since 1933.\n Biggest Regular-Season Comebacks\nIt was the week before Christmas and the Minnesota Vikings were cruising to an NFC North title at 10-3. The Indianapolis Colts (4-8-1) had endured a difficult season having fired Frank Reich and replaced him with Jeff Saturday, former offensive lineman turned consultant turned head coach. But the Vikings trailed 33-0 at halftime and 36-7 with 4:59 remaining in the third quarter before momentum shifted. C.J. Ham rushed for a touchdown and Justin Jefferson caught another. Even when Adam Thielen caught one in the end zone with 5:34 left in the game, the Vikes still trailed 36-28.",
