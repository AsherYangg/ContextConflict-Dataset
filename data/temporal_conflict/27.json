        "source_1": "Taylor has four rerecorded albums which have been released in the last few years: Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and now her latest re-release 1989 (Taylor's Version). This brings the total to 14, but don't stop counting yet.\n There's then the four live albums: Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008, Speak Now World Tour Live, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions and Lover (Live From Paris).\n With these four lives albums, it takes our grand total of Taylor Swift albums to a beyond impressive 19 albums. Seriously, does Taylor ever sleep?\n Which album is Taylor re-recording next?\n So far Taylor has re-recorded four of the six albums she created at Big Machine Records: Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version).\n Still to be re-recorded are Taylor Swift, and Reputation. As Taylor has literally only just released the re-recording of 1989 (Taylor's Version), it might be a while before we get either of the next two re-recordings.\n Why is Taylor Swift re-recording her albums?\n As any Swiftie will know, in the last few years Taylor has been busy rerecording her own version of earlier albums. But why exactly?\nWell when she was starting out in her career at 15 years old she was signed onto the record label Big Machine Records, which owned the rights to her masters aka original recordings.\n In 2018, after her contract with Big Machine Records ended, Taylor signed onto a new label Universal's Republic Records, and as part of the deal she owns the right to her masters. However, this didn't apply to her previously recorded music.",

Swift had already left the label for Republic Records and, according to her 2019 Tumblr post, had begged Borchetta to let her buy back her work.\n He instead told her she could continue to record albums for Big Machine and “earn” her songs back. She refused, and when Borchetta sold, it was to a man Swift said had bullied and gaslighted her for years, partly through his client, West, whom Swift accused of making “a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked.” The rereleases include new songs she wrote for the albums but didn’t include on the original versions, dubbed “From the Vault” releases. Swift plans to rerecord two more of her original albums, Taylor Swift and Reputation, the first and last albums Braun owns, but has not said when those will be released.",

Therefore, Lover, Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department were all made with Swift being fully in control of the rights and production, and her Taylor's Version albums are quickly reclaiming the past as well. Considering how quickly she has turned out her re-releases, it can be assumed that Swifties won't have to wait long until one of her other classic albums gets a modern redo.\n The only albums left that still need to get a Taylor's Version are Swift's debut album and Reputation. Fans have long theorized that Swift's debut album would be the final Taylor's Version to be released. Leaving these two albums for last has indicated that Swift will reclaim her reputation and her own name in the same way she has all of her music. It's likely that the albums will get their Taylor's Versions after Taylor Swift finishes her Eras Tour in late 2024.\n What's Next For Taylor Swift\nThe Megastar's Future Is Both Bright And Mysterious\nEvery generation seems to find a pop superstar to claim as their own, and much like Britney Spears and Madonna before her, Taylor Swift has captured the current musical landscape and has cemented herself as the most widely-discussed music artist of the 2020s. For her legions of fans, there's one question that will forever be on their minds until the day the cultural icon retires (if she ever does).",
