        "source_1": "The World's Highest-Paid Athletes 2024\n In the eight years since he became the world’s highest-paid athlete for the first time, much has changed for Cristiano Ronaldo. The 39-year-old Portuguese soccer star went from lighting up the Bernabéu with Real Madrid to stints with Juventus and Manchester United, until finally landing at his current home, Al Nassr of the Saudi Pro League. But no matter the location, one thing has remained constant—Ronaldo is still drawing outsized paydays.\n He earned an estimated $260 million over the last 12 months, making him the highest-paid athlete in the world for the fourth time in his career. Forbes estimates Ronaldo’s contract with Al Nassr earned him $200 million this season. And as one of the sports world’s most successful pitchmen, Ronaldo earned another $60 million off the field from an endorsement portfolio that includes Nike, Binance and Herbalife, among others.\n In total, the world’s 50 highest-paid athletes hauled in an estimated $3.88 billion over the last 12 months before taxes and agents’ fees, up 13% from last year’s record mark of $3.44 billion. Roughly 76%, or $2.94 billion, came from on-field earnings (salaries, bonuses and prize money) partly because of the Middle Eastern money continuing to flow into sports. The other 24%, or $936 million, is attributable to their endorsements, appearances, licensing and memorabilia income, and other business endeavors, which is down 13% year-over-year from $1.08 billion.\n The cutoff for this year’s top 50, like last year, is $45.2 million, a 20% hike from the previous record in 2022. Still, 10 newcomers qualified for the ranking, while another eight returned to the list after an absence of a year or longer.",
        "source_2": "022-23 and 2023-24 seasons, as well as bonuses paid out during 2023. Base salaries tend not to vary significantly from year to year, but the Saudi Pro League spending spree on soccer players introduced massive one-year leaps for stars such as Karim Benzema. The salaries listed are a blend of two seasons based on estimated payment schedules.\n NBA salaries in 2022-23 were reduced 2.65% once final accounting on the season was completed based on the league’s collective bargaining agreement. The CBA ensures a roughly 50-50 revenue split between players and teams, with an escrow account in place to withhold salaries to protect the split. The players would have received 100% of the escrow if not for a carryover shortfall from COVID-19-impacted seasons. We did not reduce salaries for 2023-24 when figuring the top 100.\n The salary totals do not include deferred compensation until it is paid out. This knocked out third baseman Nolan Arenado who has $6 million a year of his St. Louis Cardinals contract deferred without interest. Max Scherzer collected $15 million last year in deferred comp from his previous Nationals contract in addition to his current $43.3 million salary.\n Endorsement income includes earnings from sponsorships, licensing, royalties, memorabilia, appearances, golf course design, media, book deals and branded car dealerships. Every NBA player received $425,600 for the 2022-23 season from group licensing income, while NFL payouts are variable and can top $2 million for a few players including Patrick Mahomes and Dak Prescott. Sportico conducted more than 40 interviews with industry insiders to gauge the earnings.",

He signed a record deal with Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr in 2023 for $215.5 million annually.
