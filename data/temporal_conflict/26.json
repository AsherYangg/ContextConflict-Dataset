This was the state's second execution since officials started carrying out the death penalty in May after a nearly eight-year hiatus.\n July 28, 2022: Alabama executed Joe Nathan James, Jr. He was 50 years old. Officials took three hours to set an IV line before putting James to death. The Death Penalty Information Center called it \"the longest botched lethal injection execution in U.S. history. \"\nAlabama’s prison system has been in the national spotlight, as hundreds of inmates die each year inside the overcrowded facilities set to contain them, drawing criticism from the federal government. But the system more recently has drawn national headlines for its handling of executions.\n August 17, 2022: Texas executed Kosoul Chanthakoummane. He was 41 years old. It was the second execution this year in a state that typically puts more people to death than any other. He used his final statement to thank Jesus Christ, ministers with the Texas prison system and \"all these people in my life that aided me in this journey.\" Chanthakoummane added: \"To Mrs. Walker's family, I pray that my death will bring them peace,\" he said into a microphone hanging above him as he lay on a prison gurney.\n August 25, 2022: Oklahoma executed James Coddington at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was 50 years old.\nOctober 5, 2022: Texas executed John Henry Ramirez. \"I am ready, Warden,” were his last words. His case clarified the role of spiritual advisors in death chambers. The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Ramirez in March when it ruled that states must accommodate death row inmates who want to have their faith leaders pray and touch them during their executions. Ramirez's spiritual adviser placed his right hand on Ramirez's chest during his execution, and held it there for the duration.\nOctober 20, 2022: Oklahoma executed by lethal injection Benjamin Cole. He was 57 years old.",

Most executions have been concentrated in a few states and a small number of outlier counties.\n News & Developments\nOn November 8, 2023, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey sched­uled an exe­cu­tion date for Kenneth Smith, mark­ing the first attempt by a U.S. state to use nitro­gen gas in an exe­cu­tion. Mr. Smith was con­vict­ed of the 1988 mur­der-for-hire death of Elizabeth Sennett in Jefferson County, Alabama and has been on death row for near­ly 34 years. Following the state Supreme Court’s 6 – 2 deci­sion green­light­ing Attorney General Steve Marshall’s request for an exe­cu­tion war­rant, Gov. Ivey set a 32-hour execution date…\n On August 25, 2023, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall asked the state Supreme Court to set a date for Kenneth Smith to be exe­cut­ed using nitro­gen hypox­ia, a method that has nev­er been used in any state. The deci­sion to use this method comes after Alabama botched sev­er­al exe­cu­tions. Since 2018, when Alabama ini­tial­ly autho­rized the use of nitro­gen hypox­ia in cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment, the state has been work­ing to estab­lish a pro­to­col for exe­cu­tions using this method. Alabama initially…\nOn August 8, 2023, death-sen­tenced pris­on­er Aubrey Trail peti­tioned the state to set his exe­cu­tion date. Currently, there are 10 oth­ers on death row in Nebraska, but the state does not pos­sess the nec­es­sary lethal injec­tion drugs for any exe­cu­tions.",

Idaho in February also attempted its first execution in 12 years but halted the procedure when prison staff members were unable to locate a viable vein.\n Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, said this month her office would resume seeking a death warrant against an inmate in a 2002 murder: \"This is not a decision that I have made lightly, but the death penalty is the law in our state, and it is my job to uphold it.\"\n She added that it would be \"justice\" for the victim, Ted Price, who was murdered in a domestic-related dispute.\n Oklahoma's attorney general, Gentner Drummond, a Republican, echoed that the death penalty is meant to give victims' loved ones closure after the state pardon board rejected Underwood's clemency request.\n \"Jamie's family has waited 18 excruciating years for justice that finally will be carried out when this murderer is executed,\" Drummond said in a statement, also referring to Underwood as an \"evil monster. \"\nGentner, however, has also not exclusively sided against death row inmates, highlighting how officials, too, may find nuance amid the larger dispute over the death penalty.",

Lee sought exec­u­tive clemen­cy with the sup­port of Mueller’s fam­i­ly, the pros­e­cu­tor, and the judge who tried him in an Arkansas fed­er­al court. They all believed that exe­cut­ing Lee would be a mis­car­riage of jus­tice giv­en the life sen­tence imposed on his much more cul­pa­ble co-defen­dant. Judge G. Thomas Eisele described Kehoe as the ​“ring­leader,” and tri­al tes­ti­mo­ny showed that Kehoe killed Sarah Powell after Lee refused, say­ing he would not kill a child.

        "source_6": "Marcellus Williams, whose murder conviction was questioned by a prosecutor, died by lethal injection Tuesday evening in Missouri after the US Supreme Court denied a stay.\n The 55-year-old was put to death around 6 p.m. CT at the state prison in Bonne Terre.\n Williams’ attorneys had filed a flurry of appeal efforts based on what they described as new evidence – including alleged bias in jury selection and contamination of the murder weapon prior to trial. The victim’s family had asked the inmate be spared death.\n The US Supreme Court’s action came a day after Missouri’s supreme court and governor refused to grant a stay of execution.\n The high court offered no explanation for its decision, which is common for cases on its emergency docket. There were no noted dissents in two of Williiams’ appeals. In a third, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would have granted the request to pause the execution.\n Williams was convicted in 2001 of killing Felicia Gayle, a former newspaper reporter found stabbed to death in her home in 1998.\n “We hope this gives finality to a case that’s languished for decades, re-victimizing Ms. Gayle’s family for decades,” Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement read by Trevor Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections. “No juror no judge has ever found Williams’ innocence claim to be credible. Two decades of judicial proceedings and more than 15 judicial hearings upheld his guilty conviction. Thus the order of execution has been carried out.”\n In a statement after the execution, one of Williams’ attorneys, Larry Komp, said his client maintained his innocence to the end.\n “While he would readily admit to the wrongs he had done throughout his life, he never wavered in asserting his innocence of the crime for which he was put to death tonight,” Komp said."
