        "source_1": "Croatia Currency: A Guide to Money in Croatia\nAs of January 2023, the currency used in Croatia is the Euro. Prior to this change, Croatiaâs official currency was the Croatian Kuna (HRK) between 1994 and 2023. Below weâll provide you with all the information you need to know about navigating the currency in Croatia.\n The currency in Croatia is the Euro (sign: â¬; code: EUR), which has been in use since 2023.\n The Euro is divided into cents (sign: c) and uses a combination of notes and coins.\n The Euro comes in note form in multiple denominations, including 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500.\n In the form of a coin, denominations of 1, 2 and 5, 1 and 20 cents, and 1 and 2 Euros can also be found.\n Between 1994 and 2023 Croatia used the Kuna. The word âKunaâ directly translates to âMartenâ; a weasel-like Croatian native animal whose fur was once used as a form of currency many centuries ago!\n What is the Value of the Euro?\n Whilst exchange rates fluctuate regularly, weâve listed some rough estimates below to show you how the Euro compares to other currencies, such as the Australian Dollar, Great British Pound, and US Dollar, on everyday items. We would recommend using an exchange rate website such as XE.com to get the most up to date exchange rate information.\n Whilst Croatia no longer operates with the Kuna, see the value it used to hold in the video below.\n Croatian Kuna or Euros?\n With Euro now the official currency of Croatia, this is the most commonly used currency in the country.",

For the exchange of larger numbers of banknotes or coins, commercial banks may charge a fee.\n No price increases\nAny price increase tied to the changeover is forbidden. If a business violates this rule, consumers are able to report any unjustifiable price increase to the authorities who can impose fines on that business. This is a part of consumer protection.\n Exchanging Croatian kuna for euro\nAt post offices, commercial banks and the Financial Agency\nUntil 31 December 2023 kuna banknotes and coins can be exchanged for euro banknotes and coins at post offices, commercial banks and the Financial Agency only.

        "source_4": "Croatia adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January 2023, becoming the 20th member state of the eurozone. A fixed conversion rate was set at €1 = kn 7.5345[1]\nCroatia's previous currency, the kuna (Croatian for marten), used the euro (and prior to that one of the euro's major predecessors, the German mark or Deutsche Mark) as its main reference since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the kuna's exchange rate with the euro within a relatively stable range.[2]\nCroatia's European Union (EU) membership obliged it to introduce the euro once it had fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.[3] Prior to Croatian entry to the EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor of the Croatian National Bank, stated that he would like the kuna to be replaced by the euro as soon as possible after accession.[4] This had to be at least two years after Croatia joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), in addition to it meeting other criteria. Croatia joined ERM II on 10 July 2020.[5] Prime Minister Andrej Plenković stated in November 2020 that Croatia intended to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023,[6] and in December 2020 the Croatian government adopted an action plan for euro adoption.[7]\nMany small businesses in Croatia had debts denominated in euros before EU accession.[8] Croatians already used the euro for most savings and many informal transactions. Real estate, motor vehicle and accommodation prices were mostly quoted in euros.\n Convergence status\nIn its first assessment under the convergence criteria in May 2014, the country satisfied the inflation and interest rate criteria, but did not satisfy the public finances, ERM membership, and legislation compatibility criteria.[13] Subsequent convergence reports published in June 2016, May 2018 and June 2020 came to the same conclusions.",

        "source_6": "Modern currency\nThe modern kuna was introduced on 30 May 1994, starting a period of transition from the Croatian dinar, introduced in 1991, which ended on 31 December 1994.[10] One kuna was equivalent to 1,000 dinars at a fixed exchange rate. The kuna was pegged to the Deutsche Mark from the start. With the replacement of the mark by the euro, the kuna's peg effectively switched to the euro.\n The choice of the name kuna was controversial because the same currency name had been used by the Independent State of Croatia, but this was dismissed as a red herring, since the same name was also in use during the Banovina of Croatia and by the State Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH).[8] An alternative proposal for the name of the new currency was kruna (crown), divided into 100 banica (viceroy's wife), but this was deemed too similar to the Austro-Hungarian krone and found inappropriate for the country which is a republic,[8] even though Czechia and (until 2008) Slovakia have used currencies whose names translate to \"crown\".\n A long-time policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the fluctuations of the kuna's exchange rate against the euro (or, previously, the mark) within a relatively stable range. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the exchange rate between the two currencies rarely fluctuated to a substantial degree, remaining at a near constant 7.5:1 (HRK to EUR) rate. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 and the Exchange Rate Mechanism on 10 July 2020 at a rate of 7.53450 HRK to €1.[11][12]"
