His work has appeared at The Daily Brief, Payments Dive, NPR, and Newsday.\n Apple's (APPL) market cap returned above $3 trillion on Friday after briefly breaching it in January 2022. It's the only publicly listed U.S. company to reach that level, but exactly what drove the move is unclear.\n Key Takeaways\nApple's market cap returned above $3 trillion on Friday\nApple is the only publicly listed U.S. company to reach that level.\n Shares of Apple have gained 48% in value so far this year.\n The tech giant announced the launch of a new product, Apple VisionPro, earlier this month, expanding its ability to tap into the potential of virtual reality and content.\n Shares of Apple have gained 48% in value so far this year at $193 per share as of 2 p.m. ET on Friday afternoon, with Jefferies analysts forecasting they could rise as high as $219 per share this year. By contrast, the S&P 500 Index is up 16% year-to-date.\n Apple reported $94.8 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down 3% year-over-year.

        "source_4": "Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap\nApple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.\n The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple's success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.\n Apple's cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.\n Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.\n Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.\n The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.\n Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple's services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.\n In December, for example, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty raised the firm's price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren't yet baked into the share price.\n Huberty also said she expects Apple's App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley's forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.",
        "source_5": "What’s Market Cap?\nI just read that Apple has a $3 trillion dollar market cap. What does that mean?\n Signed,\nJenny L.\nDear Jenny L.,\nMarket capitalization, or market cap, is an investing term used to describe the size of a publicly traded company. It’s based on a simple formula that multiplies the number of shares of stock in a company by its share price.\n Here’s a basic example: Say you have a company with 1,000 shares of stock and each share trades for $10. Then the company’s market cap is $10,000.\n Apple’s $3 trillion market cap is absolutely astounding. The company has more than 16 billion outstanding shares of stock that during the last calendar year traded as high as $181 and as low as $116.\n One thing to remember is that a company’s market cap is always changing, along with its share price. In fact, Apple only temporarily reached its $3 trillion market cap on Jan. 3, 2022, when its share price briefly hit $182.86. Then the share price dropped 85 cents, causing the company’s market cap to close the trading day a few billion shy of $3 trillion. Yep, 85 cents add up quickly when multiplied by a number with nine zeros.\n Nevertheless, Apple is the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion valuation. That’s nearly as much as the gross domestic product of neighboring countries Canada and Mexico combined. Not bad for a business started in a garage in 1976.\n When considering which stocks to buy, investors pay close attention to a company’s market cap because it provides two very important pieces of information – a company’s size and its value. Kind of like house shopping when a homebuyer’s first questions are likely, “How big is the house?” and “What’s the asking price?”\nCompanies can also be grouped into categories based on market cap size as shown below.\n Market Capitalization\nCompany Valuation\nMega Cap\nMore than $200 billion\nLarge Cap\n$",
