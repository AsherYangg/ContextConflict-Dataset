    "question": "Who is the current leader of al-Qaeda?",

        "source_1": "Other al Qaeda affiliates are more closely linked to al Qaeda’s global leadership and therefore could be able to play a larger role in the direction of al Qaeda moving forward. Al Shabaab, for example, is assessed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to be “the largest, wealthiest and most lethal al-Qaeda affiliate in the world.” Al Shabaab also directly provides financial support to al Qaeda senior leadership from its coffers and has a demonstrated capability and intent to organize plots against the United States. Disagreements over the correct emphasis on “local” versus “global” goals are part and parcel of al Shabaab’s history, however, and al Qaeda’s leadership transition could reinvigorate those debates.\n Q3: How is the Islamic State reacting to the death of al Qaeda’s leader?\nA3: The Islamic State has made no secret of its contempt for Zawahiri and the Taliban. Islamic State propaganda often accuses the Taliban and al Qaeda’s current leadership of straying from Osama bin Laden’s vision for al Qaeda, with particularly hostile words for the Taliban’s decision to negotiate the Doha Agreement with the United States—which it accuses al Qaeda of endorsing. Immediately following Zawahiri’s death, Islamic State supporters posted celebratory messages with titles like “The Clown is Dead” and “The Dog Has Perished.”\n Prior to Zawahiri’s death, al Qaeda’s general fortunes appeared to be on the ascent. The group’s presence in Afghanistan under Taliban rule was largely secure. In the words of the chief of the United Nation’s sanctions monitoring team, al Qaeda has been in a period of “strategic restraint\" since the collapse of the Afghan government.",
        "source_2": "Second, “many Member States” have concluded that one of Zawahiri’s closest colleagues, Sayf al-‘Adl, is “already operating as the de facto and uncontested leader of the group.” Why hasn’t al-Qaeda announced al-‘Adl’s succession? UN Member States point to al-‘Adl’s “continued presence” inside Iran, which raises “difficult theological and operational questions” for al-Qaeda. Simply put, the Sunni jihadists of al-Qaeda don’t want to admit that they rely on the Shiites of Iran for safe haven. And the Iranian regime does not want to admit it harbors some of al-Qaeda’s leaders.\n As Sayf al-‘Adl’s biography shows, however, this is nothing new. The Iranians have long harbored him and other al-Qaeda figures.\n Al-Qaeda began working with Iran and Hezbollah in the early 1990s\nSayf al-‘Adl, a former lieutenant colonel in Egypt’s special forces, joined the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) in the late 1980s. The EIJ was a terrorist group that targeted the Egyptian government throughout the 1980s and eventually merged with Osama bin Laden’s operation prior to 9/11. Though the formal merger between the two was not consummated until either 1998 or the summer of 2001, depending on which sources one consults, the EIJ’s men were central to al-Qaeda’s operations by the early 1990s. For instance, according to the State Department, al-‘Adl provided training for other al-Qaeda operatives “as early as 1990.”",
        "source_3": "Al Qaeda (AQ, alt. Al Qaida or Al Qa'eda) is a transnational Sunni Islamist terrorist organization with a network of affiliates.",
        "source_4": "McCaul Reacts to Death of Al Qaeda Leader al Zawahiri\nWashington, D.C. – House Foreign Affairs Committee Lead Republican Michael McCaul has released the following statement on news the United States government has killed Ayman al Zawahiri, the current leader of al Qaeda.\n “It is a great day for America when the leader of al Qaeda is taken out. I commend those security and intelligence professionals who bravely carried out this operation. Unfortunately, today’s attack also serves as a reminder the American people were lied to by President Biden. Al Qaeda is not ‘gone’ from Afghanistan as Biden falsely claimed a year ago. And worse, the head of al Qaeda, who was one of the masterminds behind 9/11, was given safe harbor in the capitol city of Kabul – just as al Qaeda was given safe harbor there before 9/11. Our chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan opened the door for al Qaeda to operate freely inside the country to conduct external operations against the United States and our allies again.”",
        "source_5": "A post-al-Zawahri al-Qaida very much depends on who is the next leader. We don’t know who will consolidate power, though longtime jihadi Saif al-Adel is often mentioned as a candidate. Terrorist groups often rise and fall depending on the quality of leadership, and indeed part of why the Islamic State group (IS) was able to gain such support was because al-Zawahri was unable to motivate many jihadists, and they cast about for a more exciting leader and new direction. A new leader might re-energize al-Qaida, but in the near term and perhaps longer he may struggle to consolidate power and gain the respect of the rank-and-file.\n Al-Qaida will also benefit from the weakness of IS, which fell from the dizzying heights it achieved in 2014–15. Like al-Qaida, IS persists, both as a model and as an organization, though it is far weaker and less inspiring now that it has lost the caliphate and no longer controls significant territory. IS still endures with forces fighting in Syria and supporters around the world, but it is far less capable of acting on its own or inspiring others.\n Al-Qaida affiliates may take this moment to further increase their distance from the core, at least in practice, if not in rhetoric. Much depends on the new leader and his networks, but it is hard for any leader to maintain control of this always-fractious movement, particularly when the communication and visibility necessary to establish a presence greatly increases the risk of being detected by the United States and its allies. It is possible that the next al-Qaida leader may simply be a figurehead, exercising even less influence than did al-Zawahri over the day-to-day activities of local jihadis.\n Any new leader might seek to take revenge for al-Zawahri and has a strong short-term incentive to support high-profile terrorist attacks on the West as a way of gaining attention, attracting money, inspiring recruits, and proving the new leader’s credentials.",
        "source_6": "That operation targeted and killed al Qaeda’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri was Osama bin Laden’s deputy during the 9/11 attacks and his successor in 2011, following bin Laden’s death during a U.S. counterterrorism mission. Zawahiri continued to pose an active threat to U.S. persons, interests, and national security.\n As President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans. We met that commitment on Saturday night. And in doing so, we showed that, without American forces on the ground in Afghanistan and in harm’s way, we remain able to identify and locate even the world’s most wanted terrorist, and then take action to remove him from the battlefield.\n Zawahiri was al Qaeda’s most senior leader since June 2011. He continued to provide strategic direction to al Qaeda’s affiliates worldwide, calling for attacks on the United States. His death deals a significant blow to al Qaeda and will degrade the group’s ability to operate, including against the U.S. homeland.\n Our ability to locate Zawahiri after years of hiding was the result of careful, patient, and persistent work by our counterterrorism professionals. And our ability to act on it effectively was made possible by quick, decisive action by the President once we knew with confidence where Zawahiri was located and that we could conduct the operation in a manner that limited the risk of civilian casualties.\n As with all similar operations, various parts of the counterterrorism community collaborated closely to plan and execute this complex operation.\n For several years, the U.S. government has been aware of a network that we assessed supported Zawahiri.\n In the last year, we had been watching for indications of al Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan.\n This year, we identified that Zawahiri’s family — his wife, his daughter, and her children — relocated to a safe house in Kabul.\n We then identified Zawahiri at the location in Kabul through layering multiple streams of intelligence."
