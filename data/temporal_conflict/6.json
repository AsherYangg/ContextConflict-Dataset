The most recent winner is was Spanish player Rodri in 2024. Prior to that the award has been dominated by Argentinian Lionel Messi, winning the men's Ballon d'Or award a record eight times. Cristiano Ronaldo also won the award five times.\n Many visitors to this page are looking for the results of the FIFA player of the year, which was merged with the Ballon d'Or between 2010 and 2015 to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, but is now a separate award.",
        "source_2": "Ballon d'Or\nThe Ballon d'Or (French pronunciation:[balɔ̃dɔʁ]ⓘ; lit.'Golden Ball') is an annual football award presented by French magazine France Football since 1956 to honour the player deemed to have performed the best over the previous season.\n Conceived by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran, the Ballon d'Or was based exclusively on voting by football journalists up until 2006. Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.\n Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award, The Best FIFA Men's Player. In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men's World Ranking would elect the winner of the award. UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d'Or gala since 2024, with France Football retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name.",
        "source_3": "Messi’s stats aren’t too shabby for the period in question — August 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024 — with 22 goals and 13 assists in all competitions for Inter Miami, who he helped win the 2024 Supporters' Shield.\n But injury heavily curtailed his game time, and the quality of MLS is widely regarded as inferior to Europe’s biggest leagues, which would have played a major part in Messi, 37, dropping out. Simply put: others have played more and performed better in tougher leagues.\n What is the Ballon d’Or?\n Sparking debates in barbershops and online, the award presented by the magazine France Football since 1956 (since 2018 for women) is meant to name the best footballers in the world for that year.\n This year, UEFA — European football’s governing body — will help organise the award for the first time. FIFA and France Football collaborated on the award from 2010 to 2015, but FIFA created its own trophy eight years ago, The Best.\n Messi leads the way with eight Ballon d’Or wins between 2009 and 2023. Ronaldo has five. The pair have dominated the men’s award in recent history but, for the first time in 21 years, neither has been nominated.\n In the women’s game, Spaniards have won the last three awards — Alexia Putellas has two and Aitana Bonmati was the most recent winner. Both are nominated again for the 2024 award.\n The popularity of the award in wider culture has even led to the release of an Afrobeats song named after it — B. D’OR by Grammy-winning artist Burna Boy (a Manchester United fan).",

        "source_6": "The FIFA Ballon d'Or (\"Golden Ball\") was an annual association football award presented to the world's best men's player from 2010 to 2015. Awarded jointly by FIFA and France Football, the prize was a merger of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or, the two most prestigious individual honours in world football. Unlike the Ballon d'Or awarded by France Football, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, was not awarded solely based on votes from international journalists, but votes from national team coaches and captains also, who selected the players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\n Messi, who played for Barcelona, won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010 and went on to win three in a row, after his wins in 2011 and 2012. Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid, won successive awards in the next two years. The final FIFA Ballon d'Or was presented to Messi in 2015. Its awarding bodies subsequently ended their partnership; for 2016, France Football reintroduced the previous format of the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA created The Best FIFA Men's Player award.\n History\nHistorically, the leading individual awards in association football were the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[1][2] The original Ballon d'Or, also known as the European Footballer of the Year award, had been awarded by the French publication France Football since 1956. The FIFA World Player of the Year award was presented by FIFA, the sport's governing body, from 1991.[3]\nFrom 2005, the winners of the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award were identical each year. Following the introduction of a global Ballon d'Or format in 2007, France Football and FIFA opted to merge the two awards. The creation of the FIFA Ballon d'Or was subsequently announced during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[3]"
