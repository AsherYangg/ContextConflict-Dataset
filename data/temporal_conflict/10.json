That state is Florida, which as a retirement haven appeals to Cracker Barrel's mostly older demographic.\n According to Cracker Barrel's website, Florida currently has roughly 50 Cracker Barrel options that span the state from end to end. These locations range from Orlando and Jacksonville to West Palm Beach and Destin, with Cracker Barrel shops in proximity no matter where you're traveling within Florida.

Per the restaurant's website, stores are wide-reaching and far-ranging.
