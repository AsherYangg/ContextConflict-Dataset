There were no measurable differences between 2009–10 and 2019–20 in the percentage of public schools that reported requiring school uniforms.\n During the 2019–20 school year, greater percentages of elementary schools and middle schools than of secondary/high schools reported a requirement that students wear uniforms (21 and 18 percent vs. 12 percent).1 Schools where 25 percent or less of the students were students of color2 reported the lowest instance of a requirement that students wear uniforms\n1 The term students of color is being used synonymously with minority students in Digest table 233.70. Students of color include those who are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and of Two or more races.\n 2 Elementary schools are defined as schools that enroll students in more of grades K through 4 than in higher grades. Middle schools are defined as schools that enroll students in more of grades 5 through 8 than in higher or lower grades. Secondary/high schools are defined as schools that enroll students in more of grades 9 through 12 than in lower grades. Combined/other schools include all other combinations of grades, including K12 schools.\n SOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics. (2022).

We only ask that you follow a few basic guidelines.\n School uniforms: Do they really improve student achievement, behavior?\nby Denise-Marie Ordway, The Journalist's Resource April 20, 2018\n1\nDecades ago, uniforms were mostly worn by students who went to private or parochial schools. But as local school boards have focused more on improving standardized test scores and campus safety, a growing number have begun requiring school uniforms — typically, a polo shirt of a particular color paired with navy or khaki pants, skirts or shorts. Nearly 22 percent of public schools in the United States required uniforms in 2015-16 — up from almost 12 percent in 1999-2000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n Proponents argue that students will pay more attention to their classwork if they aren’t preoccupied with fashion, and that they’ll be better behaved. Meanwhile, school administrators say uniforms help eliminate gang-related styles and logos. They also make it easier to spot a stranger on campus.\n Despite their reported benefits, mandatory uniforms are controversial because a lot of parents and students don’t like the idea of forcing children to dress alike, which they say suppresses freedom of expression. Some families complain about the financial burden of purchasing uniforms in addition to their kids’ other clothing. Years ago, parents also complained that it was difficult to find uniforms, but that ceased to be an issue after large chain stores like Target and Wal-Mart began selling them.\n As public schools debate the merits of uniforms — some school boards have been bouncing the idea around for years — it’s important for journalists to know what the research says on this topic. School officials do not always consult academic research before they put a plan on the table.\n To help journalists ground their reporting and fact-check claims, Journalist’s Resource has rounded up several academic studies worth reviewing.",
        "source_3": "[96][98]\nU.S. Uniform Statistics\n According to the most recent figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, 18.8% of American public schools required students to wear school uniforms during the 2019-2020 school year, with more elementary (21%) and middle (18%) schools requiring uniforms than high schools (12%). Schools where students of color represented less than 25% of the student population were less likely to require uniforms, whereas schools with a higher proportion of students of color were more likely to enact and enforce dress codes. [100]\nPro Arguments\nPro 1: School uniforms deter crime and increase student safety.\n In Long Beach, California, after two years of a district-wide K-8 mandatory uniform policy, reports of assault and battery in the district’s schools decreased by 34%, assault with a deadly weapon dropped by 50%, fighting incidents went down by 51%, sex offenses were cut by 74%, robbery dropped by 65%, possession of weapons (or weapon “look-alikes”) decreased by 52%, possession of drugs went down by 69%, and vandalism was lowered by 18%. [64]\nOne year after Sparks Middle School in Nevada instituted a uniform policy, school police data showed a 63% drop in police log reports, and decreases were also noted in gang activity, student fights, graffiti, property damage, and battery. A peer-reviewed study found that schools with uniform policies had 12% fewer firearm-related incidents and 15% fewer drug-related incidents than schools without uniforms. [25][69]\nSchool uniforms also prevent students from concealing weapons under baggy clothing, make it easier to keep track of students on field trips, and make intruders on campus more visible. Frank Quatrone, superintendent in the Lodi school district of New Jersey, states, “When you have students dressed alike, you make them safer.",
        "source_4": "Philadelphia, PA\nDallas/Fort Worth, TX\nWashington, DC\nNew Orleans, LA\nDetroit, MI\nJacksonville, FL\nAtlanta, GA\nSchools in 21 states and the District of Columbia have some sort of uniform requirements.\n Some cities have widespread uniform use in their public schools:\n95% of New Orleans' public schools require uniforms\n85% of Cleveland's public schools require uniforms\n80% of Chicago's public schools require uniforms\n65% of Boston's public schools require uniforms\n60% of Miami's public schools require uniforms\n50% of Cincinnati's public schools require uniforms\nAfter the first public school began using uniforms, there was a considerable increase in the use of uniforms, partly fueled by President Bill Clinton mentioning the benefits of school uniforms in his inaugural address in 1996, as indicated in a report from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):\nPrior to the 1994-1995 school year only about three-quarters of one percent of students in the US were required to wear uniforms.\n By the 1996-1997 school year, that number had increased about four-fold to 3 percent. â€¢ A marketing research group, NDP Group, Inc., reported that school-uniform sales were valued at $900 million in 1999 and rose 22% to $1.1 billion in 2000.\n The National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) conducted a phone survey of 755 principals in 2000, which revealed that:\n21% of all public schools had a uniform policy\n23% of all public, private, and sectarian schools either had a uniform policy, were in the process of creating one, or had firm plans in place to create one.\n 71% of the 755 schools represented did not require uniforms and were not considering requiring them.",
        "source_5": "K-12 public schools in the US should enforce uniforms\nIt isn’t a surprise that uniform policies are being made in schools across America, considering their many benefits. Many public schools are gradually switching to a school uniform system; as of Jan. 1, 2023, one in every five public schools in the United States requires students to wear uniforms.\n Public schools in the United States, ranging from elementary to high school, should require students to wear uniforms during school hours because they create safer school environments and improve students’ discipline and punctuality.\nK-12 schools that adopted school uniform policies have increased discipline levels among students, leading to safer school environments. Jay Wheeler, a School Board member of Osceola County, Florida, reported that the schools within the county had a 46% reduction in gang-related activities after their first school year enforcing a mandatory K-12 uniform policy. When a uniform policy was implemented during the 2009 – 2010 school year at Sparks Middle School in Nevada, local police data showed a 63% decrease in police log reports; there was a reduction in student fights, gang-related activities, graffiti, and property damage. The data shown in these two instances display the correlation between school uniforms and school environments (affected by the discipline level among students), and how establishing uniform policies can create a safer environment for students and school staff.\n Not only did uniform policies in schools across the country create safer school environments, but they have also been shown to reduce absences and increase student punctuality. A group of researchers at the University of Houston found that the average absence rate in Houston for schools that adopted a school uniform policy during the 2008 – 2009 school year has decreased by 7% for middle and high school girls and 4% for middle and high school boys. These percentages translate to 29,482 fewer absences for Houston schools during the 2008-2009 school year. Youngstown State University conducted a study regarding schools in one of Ohio’s largest school districts. They researched the relationship between attendance rates and school uniforms in Ohio schools.",
        "source_6": "The authors’ implication here is that:\nUniforms improve discipline.\n Discipline leads to better grades, therefore\nUniforms may cause better grades.\n 3. 20% of US Schools have Uniform Policies (Up 8%)\nSchool uniforms are more popular than ever in the United States. The latest data from The National Center for Education Statistics finds 20 percent of schools in the United States require school uniforms (that was for the 2017-2018 school year)[3].\n This is up 8 percent since 2000, where the same statistical survey found just 12 percent of schools in the US required uniforms.\n A common reason for the requirement to wear uniforms is that it helps identify students as belonging to the school (and helps identify intruders). But other schools without uniforms employ alternative safety methods for identifying students on school grounds, such as requiring students to carry school photo ID (9 percent of schools).\n 3. Primary Schools (23%) require Uniforms more than Middle (18%) and High Schools (10%) in the US\nThe National Center for Education Statistics [3] also dissected uniform policies according to school type. They found that primary schools have the highest incidence of school uniform policies:\nPrimary Schools with Uniform Policies: 23%.\n Middle Schools with Uniform Policies: 18%.\n High Schools with Uniform Policies: 10%.\n However, while school uniform requirements are relaxed as students get older, strict dress codes become more common in middle and high school. It would appear that dress code policies are often necessary in the absence of school uniforms to ensure appropriate attire:\nin the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, Nicole Nathan and a team of researchers[5] explore the relationship between school sports uniforms and participation in physical education lessons.\n The study found that there was “significant reduction in sedentary activity” among students who wore uniforms.\n It is reasonable to assume that this is due to the fact students in uniform were wearing clothing that was more suited to physical activity than their everyday attire, facilitating greater participation.\n6."
