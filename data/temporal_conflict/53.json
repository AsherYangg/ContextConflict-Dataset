        "source_1": "History\nFounded 136 years ago as Birkdale Golf Club in 1889, the club was awarded \"Royal\" status in 1951.[2] Birkdale Golf Club moved to a new site in Birkdale Hills in 1894,[2] and built a new distinctive art deco clubhouse in 1935.[2] In early 1939, Birkdale was nominated as the venue for the 1940 Open Championship[3] but the Second World War started in September 1939 and the Championship was cancelled.\n In 1946, the club finally hosted its first big championship in the Amateur Championship, won by Irishman Jimmy Bruen. During the immediate postwar era, the club also hosted the 1948 Curtis Cup and the 1951 Walker Cup, both won by the United States. With these successful stagings of important events, Royal Birkdale was felt to be ready for its first Open Championship in 1954 and has continued on the Open rota ever since.\n Three generations of the Hawtree family of golf course architects have worked on the course.[4] Frederick G. Hawtree and champion golfer J.H. Taylor are the two people most responsible for the current routing,[4] following the valleys between the very large dunes which dominate the property. The arrangement makes for excellent spectator conditions during major events. Frederick W. Hawtree, the son of Frederick G, performed some modifications in the 1960s and in 1993 Martin Hawtree, son of Frederick W., improved and modernised the layout further, with all 18 of the club's greens being completely rebuilt, to improve turf and drainage following the 1991 Open Championship.[5] Only relatively minor tweaking, such as the addition of a few new bunkers and back tees, has been deemed necessary in advance of the last two Open Championships.[6]",

        "source_3": "2017/Royal Birkdale\nShare article\nJordan Spieth showed remarkable resilience and skill to bounce back from a poor start to his final round in The 146th Open at Royal Birkdale and secure a victory that ensured he joined the pantheon of Champion Golfers of the Year.\n A record-breaking crowd of 235,000 spectators were enthralled by events at Royal Birkdale, as Spieth moved to within one win of a grand slam of majors and, by the age of 23, had the Masters, the US Open and The Open crowns to his name.\n Only Jack Nicklaus has been quicker to win three of golf’s most coveted titles. Whereas Nicklaus achieved the feat in his 16th major, Spieth was playing at Birkdale in his 19th, while Tiger Woods took one more.\n “I don't compare myself (to Woods or Nicklaus),” explained Spieth. “And I don't think comparisons are appropriate or necessary. To be in that company, no doubt, is absolutely incredible. And I certainly appreciate it.\n “But I'm very careful as to what that means going forward because what those guys have done has transcended the sport. And in no way, shape or form do I think I'm anywhere near that. It's a good start but there is a long way to go.”\n Despite leading The Open after each of the first three rounds, the American found himself behind on the leaderboard for the first time after an eventful 13th hole of the final round and trailed compatriot Matt Kuchar by one stroke.\n What happened next was the stuff of legend; Spieth proceeded to birdie the par-three 14th, where he almost had a hole in one, ran in a putt of around 40 feet at the 15th for an eagle, birdied the 16th from around 20 feet, and rolled in another good putt for a birdie at the 17th. It was golf that belied what had gone beforehand.",
        "source_4": "Alternates\nTo make up the full field of 156, additional places were allocated in ranking order from the Official World Golf Ranking at the time that these places were made available by the Championship Committee.\n Second round\nIn difficult conditions, Jordan Spieth followed his first round 65 with a 69 to lead by two strokes from Matt Kuchar.[15] Only eight players scored under par for their second rounds, Zach Johnson's 66 being the best round of the day. Alfie Plant was the only amateur to make the cut. He eagled the par-five 15th on his way to a 73 and a 36-hole total of 144.[16]\nGrace scorecard\nFinal round\nBeginning the round with a three-shot lead, Jordan Spieth bogeyed three of his first four holes to fall into a tie with Matt Kuchar.[19] A birdie at the 5th combined with a bogey by Kuchar at the 6th allowed Spieth to re-open a two-stroke advantage, but a bogey-birdie swing at the 9th evened the score heading to the back-nine. The score remained level until the 13th, when Spieth hit his tee shot well to the right of the fairway. Forced to take an unplayable lie and drop from the practice area, he managed to get up-and-down to save bogey while Kuchar took the lead by making par.[20] At the par-3 14th, however, Spieth nearly holed his tee shot and converted the birdie attempt to tie Kuchar.[21] Then at the par-5 15th, Spieth made a 48-foot (15 m) eagle putt to take the lead once again. With birdies on the next two holes Spieth played 14–17 in five-under to take a two-stroke lead heading to the last.",
        "source_5": "22 Oct Open Championship\nThe 2017 Open Championship was one of the most dramatic in recent history. The record books will show a three-shot victory for Jordan Spieth over fellow American Matt Kuchar. However, the drama that led to that margin of victory will long live in history.\n Spieth and Kuchar were locked together from day one, neither player straying too far from the top of the leaderboard over the four days. Another contender, Brandon Grace, shot the lowest score ever in a major tournament on day three, with a 62 taking him from four over to four under par.\n However, the final day was about Spieth. He led by two shots at the start of the day but was locked at eight under with Kuchar as they approached the 13th hole. A wild tee shot onto a huge dune to the right of the hole, and an unplayable lie may have seen many players crumble. Spieth kept his head, took a drop onto the practice ground and managed a remarkable recovery to restrict the damage to a bogey. Now one behind, he went on a run of birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie, birdie to claw victory from the jaws of defeat.",
        "source_6": "The 2017 Open Championship\nSpieth Victorious at Royal Birkdale\nJordan Spieth is The Open champion, just like expected, though not like anyone could have imagined.\n On the verge of another meltdown in a major, so wild off the tee that he played one shot from the driving range at Royal Birkdale and lost the lead for the first time all weekend, Spieth bounced back with a collection of clutch shots, delivering a rally that ranks among the best.\n A near ace. A 50-foot eagle putt . A 30-foot birdie putt.\n Spieth played the final five holes in 5 under and closed with a 1-under 69 for a three-shot victory over Matt Kuchar, giving him the third leg of the career Grand Slam and a chance to be the youngest to win them all next month at the PGA Championship.\n Spieth joined Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win three different majors at age 23, and even the Golden Bear was impressed.\n Spieth missed four putts inside 8 feet on the front nine and lost his three-shot lead. Then, he looked certain to lose The Open -- and the reputation he craves as a reliable closer -- when his tee shot on the par-4 13th was some 75 yards right of the fairway, buried in grass on a dune so steep he could barely stand up.\n He took a penalty shot for an unplayable lie, and when he realized the practice range was in play, headed back on a line so far that he was behind the equipment trucks. He still had a blind shot with a 3-iron over the dunes to a fairway littered with pot bunkers, stopping just short of one of them near the green."
