        "source_1": "An international crew of seven people live and work while traveling at a speed of five miles per second, orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes. Sometimes more are aboard the station during a crew handover.\n In 24 hours, the space station makes 16 orbits of Earth, traveling through 16 sunrises and sunsets.\n Peggy Whitson set the U.S. record for spending the most total time living and working in space at 665 days on Sept. 2, 2017.\n The living and working space in the station is larger than a six-bedroom house (and has six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window).\n To mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass in the human body in microgravity, the astronauts work out at least two hours a day.\n Astronauts and cosmonauts regularly conduct spacewalks for space station construction, maintenance and upgrades.\n Through Expedition 60, the microgravity laboratory has hosted nearly 3,000 research investigations from researchers in more than 108 countries.\n The station’s orbital path takes it over 90 percent of the Earth’s population, with astronauts taking millions of images of the planet below. Check them out at https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov.\n Anchored to a foot restraint on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) or Canadarm2, astronaut David A. Wolf, STS-112 mission specialist, participates in the mission’s first session of extravehicular activity (EVA).\n NASA\nMore than 20 different research payloads can be hosted outside the station at once, including Earth sensing equipment, materials science payloads, particle physics experiments like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 and more.\n The space station travels an equivalent distance to the Moon and back in about a day.\n The Water Recovery System reduces crew dependence on water delivered by a cargo spacecraft by 65 percent – from about 1 gallon a day to a third of a gallon.",
        "source_2": "As the Shuttle flights expanded the station, crew sizes also expanded, eventually reaching six around 2010.[241][242] With the arrival of crew on larger US commercial spacecraft beginning in 2020,[243] crew size has been increased to seven, the number for which ISS was originally designed.[244][245]\nOleg Kononenko of Roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the ISS, accumulating nearly 1,111 days in space over the course of five long-duration missions on the ISS (Expedition 17, 30/31, 44/45, 57/58/59 and 69/70/71). He also served as commander three times (Expedition 31, 58/59 and 70/71).[246]\nPrivate flights\nTravellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by Roscosmos and NASA, and are sometimes referred to as \"space tourists\", a term they generally dislike.[d] As of June 2023[update], thirteen space tourists have visited the ISS; nine were transported to the ISS on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and four were transported on American SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft. For one-tourist missions, when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a Soyuz, and a short-stay crewmember is not sent, the spare seat is sold by MirCorp through Space Adventures. Space tourism was halted in 2011 when the Space Shuttle was retired and the station's crew size was reduced to six, as the partners relied on Russian transport seats for access to the station. Soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013, allowing five Soyuz flights (15 seats) with only two expeditions (12 seats) required. [",

        "source_4": "Page version status\nThis is a list of all of the visitors to the International Space Station (ISS), including long-term crew, short-term visitors, and space tourists, in alphabetical order. ISS crew names are in bold. The suffix (twice, three times, ...) refers to the individual's number of spaceflights to the ISS, not the total number of spaceflights. Entries without a flag symbol indicate that the individual was an American citizen at launch. Entries without a female symbol () are men.\n Statistics\n As of September 12, 2021[update], 244 individuals[1] have made 403 spaceflights to the ISS, including the seven people currently at the ISS (Expedition 65). Two people have made five spaceflights to the ISS, while five people have made four, 36 people made three and 84 people made two. Note that this list assigns individuals with dual citizenship to their country of primary residence at time of launch (for example, the Iranian-American space tourist Anousheh Ansari is only listed under the United States).\n Initially all private space travel was aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. When only two crew members are required in the three-seat Soyuz, and additional cargo is not sent, the additional seat is sold to the general public through Space Adventures. Private travelers would remain on the ISS during handover from one expedition crew to the next, generally a week or two. The NASASpace Shuttle carried seven crew members, and the longest docking with the ISS was 11 days. Many visitors to the ISS were accommodated for short periods during NASA shuttle dockings.\n^\"Axiom-1: First all-private crew launches to space station\". BBC News. 8 April 2022. Retrieved 2 October 2023. While Russia allowed private astronaut endeavours to visit the 23-year-old station as far back as 2001, NASA resisted the practice - until announcing a change in policy in 2019 designed to boost commercial opportunities.",
