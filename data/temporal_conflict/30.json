        "source_1": "2000.\n Miami is one of 3 teams in the AFC with a winning overall record against New England (the others being the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs). Since 2003, the Patriots have dominated the rivalry, but not as much as their rivalries with their two other AFC East opponents.[8][9] In 2004, one of the most famous moments in the rivalry happened where the Dolphins, 2–11 at the time, upset the defending champion Patriots, who were 12–1, in a game that has been known as \"The Night That Courage Wore Orange\".[10] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban (who previously served as defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, coached by Bill Belichick at the time) was hired as the Dolphins head coach and when he nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees with the Dolphins, as well as in 2008 when the Dolphins became the only team other than the Patriots since 2003 to win the division.[11] In Week 3 of the aforementioned 2008 season, the Dolphins used the Wildcat formation to throw the Patriots (who were without Tom Brady that year because of an ACL injury earlier in the season) off and went on to upset them, 38–13, snapping their 20-game regular season winning streak that dated back to December 10, 2006, which coincidentally, the Patriots were also beat by the Dolphins.[12] In 2018, the Dolphins upset the Patriots in Miami for the second year in a row, this time with a last-minute hook and lateral scoring play in what is known as the \"Miracle in Miami\".[13]\n On February 4, 2019, the Dolphins hired a long-time Patriots assistant, Brian Flores (who had been with the team since their 2004 Super Bowl-winning season) as the 12th head coach in franchise history.",

        "source_4": "Patriots crushed by Dolphins, 34-15, to fall to 3-9 on the season\nBOSTON -- The New England Patriots were completely dominated by the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, losing 34-15 at Hard Rock Stadium to fall to 3-9 on the season. Jerod Mayo's team had no answers for Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami offense in Week 12, while Drake Maye and the New England offense never really got going thanks to a plethora of penalties by the Patriots' offensive line.\n One week after Matthew Stafford ripped the Patriots' defense to shreds, Tagovailoa picked them apart for 317 yards and four touchdowns off 29 of 40 passing. Jaylen Waddle was a beast with eight receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, while former Patriots tight end Jonnu Smith had nine receptions for 87 yards and a touchdown.\n \"Hard pill to swallow,\" Mayo said after the loss. \"We showed some fight at the end which is encouraging. But in this game every single play counts. \"\nMaye remained upbeat after the defeat, despite his hatred of losing football games.\n \"I hate losing more than I really like to win. Losing sucks,\" said Maye. \"What I told some of the guys inside, just remember this feeling. Remember this feeling of really getting our butts whooped. I think it's only up from here. We got a bright future and bright players in there that are going to make some players for the Patriots. \"\nThe Patriots have now lost three of their last four games this season. New England has won just twice in their last 12 visits to Miami.\n Patriots crumble in second quarter\nThe second quarter was one of the worst of the season for New England, as the Dolphins scored 24 points in the frame and racked up 209 yards. The Patriots had negative-11 yards in the quarter.\n The Patriots had a chance to score first, but Joey Slye missed a 45-yard field goal attempt on a drive that saw the New England offensive line get hit with three penalties.",

        "source_6": "Patriots' possessions — one with a touchdown that was overturned on replay, and another that fizzled when New England, after completing a pass at the Miami 11 in the middle of the field, was unable to stop the clock.\n “Honestly, nothing was good,” said Patriots quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who was 18 of 34 for 160 yards. “Penalties in the wrong situations, in bad situations. We’re not good enough to do that, to go backwards and try to score points.”\n Jason Sanders kicked three field goals for Miami to overcome three botched special teams plays, and the Dolphins won for the first time since quarterback Tua Tagovailoa went out with a concussion in Week 2.\n Making his second start as Miami's fourth quarterback, Tyler Huntley completed 18 of 31 passes for 194 yards and one interception. Tyreek Hill caught six passes for 69 yards, Jaylen Wright ran for 86 and Raheem Mostert added 80 on the ground for the Dolphins.\n Ingold's 3-yard run capped a 15-play, 80-yard drive that was more like 95 with penalties figured in.\n After the 2-point attempt failed, the Patriots (1-4) still had two more chances to take the lead.\n The Patriots celebrated a go-ahead touchdown pass with 63 seconds left, but replays showed Ja’Lynn Polk’s second heel came down on the end line. After two no-chance incompletions — and yet another penalty — the Patriots turned the ball over on downs.\n New England got the ball back on its own 43 with 29 seconds left, and Brissett connected on a 21-yard pass to Kayshon Boutte at the Dolphins 36; with no timeouts, the Patriots hustled to spike the ball with 12 seconds left. Brissett hit Hunter Henry at the 11 but near the yardage markers — too far inbounds for them to have a chance to stop the clock.\n “As the game wore on,"
