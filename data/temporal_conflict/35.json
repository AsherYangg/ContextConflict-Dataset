        "source_1": "2021.[6]\nSince the 2002 season, the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day, prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season. The first one, featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants, was held on September 5, 2002, largely to celebrate New York City's resilience in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[7] Since 2004, the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. Under this scheduling system, the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4, as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Monday, while the latest possible is September 10, as it was in the 2009, 2015, and 2020 seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday.\n This chart of the 2023 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The Chiefs in 2023 (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the AFC West. Thus, in 2024, the Chiefs will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the AFC North and NFC South (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the AFC East, AFC South (highlighted in orange) and NFC West (highlighted in pink).\n Currently, the fourteen different opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:[8][9]\nEach team plays twice against each of the other three teams in its division: once at home, and once on the road (six games).\n Each team plays once against each of the four teams from a predetermined division (based on a three-year rotation) within its own conference: two at home, and two on the road (four games).",

        "source_5": "The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966. Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970.[6] The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue,[7] and the sports league with the most valuable teams.[8] The NFL also has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world[9] and is the most popular sports league in the United States.[10] The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world,[11] with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the top five of Nielsen's all-time most-watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.[12] The NFL is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.\n Founding and history\n On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Indians, and Dayton Triangles at the Jordan and Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton, Ohio.[13] This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to \"raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules\".[14]\nAlthough the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 record.[18]",
