        "source_1": "How many exoplanets are there?\nTo date, more than 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered and are considered \"confirmed\" out of the billions in our galaxy alone. There are thousands of other \"candidate\" exoplanet detections that require further observations in order to say for sure whether or not the exoplanet is real.\n Remarkably, the first exoplanets were just discovered in the 1990s. We live in an extraordinary time where in the span of a single generation, the centuries-old question \"Are there planets orbiting other stars?\" has been answered with a resounding \"Yes!\"",
        "source_2": "Exoplanets\nAn exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, but some free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, are untethered to any star. We’ve confirmed more than 5,800 exoplanets out of the billions that we believe exist.\n Overview\nMost of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. (\"Small\" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) Even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away. We know there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.\n By measuring exoplanets’ sizes (diameters) and masses (weights), we can see compositions ranging from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn). Some planets may be dominated by water or ice, while others are dominated by iron or carbon. We’ve identified lava worlds covered in molten seas, puffy planets the density of Styrofoam and dense cores of planets still orbiting their stars.\n Exoplanets\nGet set for launch. “Eyes on Exoplanets” will fly you to any planet you wish—as long as it's far beyond our solar system. This fully rendered 3D universe is scientifically accurate, allowing you to zoom in for a close look at more than 1,000 exotic planets known to orbit distant stars.\n Exoplanet Types\nSo far scientists have categorized exoplanets into the following types: Gas giant, Neptunian, super-Earth, and terrestrial with subcategories like mini-Neptunes within those groups.\n Exoplanet Travel Bureau\nHow Do We Find Exoplanets?\nExoplanets are far, but scientists have discovered creative ways to spot these seemingly tiny objects.",
        "source_3": "2024, a total of 5,811 confirmed exoplanets are listed in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, including a few that were confirmations of controversial claims from the late 1980s.[58] The first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in 1988 by the Canadian astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia.[59] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[60] but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[61] Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[62]\n On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsarPSR 1257+12.[45] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.[63] These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits. As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet may be able to be formed in their orbit.[64]",
        "source_4": "How many exoplanets have been discovered?\nNASA estimates that the Milky Way Galaxy is home to at least 100 billion planets. Others believe it could be anywhere from 200-300 billion. Using data from exoplanet-hunting missions such as Kepler, Gaia, and now James Webb, we can identify and confirm their existence. So, how many exoplanets have been discovered?\n These are the number of confirmed exoplanets and planetary systems by NASA, followed by the number of exoplanet candidates, which are discoveries that could be planets but are still unconfirmed by researchers.\n What is an exoplanet?\n An exoplanet is any planet orbiting a star outside of our solar system. Exoplanets can come in many different sizes and compositions. NASA categorizes the 5,241 confirmed exoplanets into 5 subtypes: Neptune-like, Super Earth, Gas Giant, Terrestrial, and the unknowns. Here’s how the space agency describes each:\nNeptune-like (1,919) These planets are Neptunian worlds, similar to Uranus or Neptune in our solar system.\n Super Earth (1,689) Super-Earths are exotic planets unlike any in our solar system–more massive than Earth yet lighter than gas giants like Neptune, and they can be made of gas, rock, or a combination of both.\n Gas Giant (1,786) These planets belong to a class known as gas giants, similar to Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system.\n How do we find them?\n Currently, there are 5 different methods scientists use to identify exoplanets. These include measuring tiny changes in a star’s brightness to looking for wobbling stars, usually caused by orbiting planets. Here’s how many exoplanets have been discovered by each method in 2023:",
        "source_5": "Exoplanet and Candidate Statistics\nOn this page we have assembled statistics for various categories of confirmed exoplanets, TESS candidates, and Kepler candidates. The values here come from confirmed planet data in the Planetary Systems interactive table, and candidate data from the KOI Cumulative table; TESS Project Candidate counts are from ExoFOP-TESS.\n The Exoplanet Archive's collection of known exoplanets were discovered using a variety of methods, and many have been detected using multiple methods. The following tables show the number of planets contained within the Exoplanet Archive whose discovery can be attributed to a particular technique. The criteria by which a planet is included in the Exoplanet Archive is described on our Exoplanet Criteria page.\n Clicking on a link returns a pre-filtered interactive table for that particular data set.

        "source_6": "Did the other stars in the Universe have planets orbiting them? If so, what percent of them had planets? How many did they have? And were the planets like ours, or were they vastly different?\nJust thirty years ago, humanity was beginning to uncover the answers, as we started to discover planets in orbit around stars other than our own. At last, through a combination of multiple different methods ⁠— the radial velocity method, timing measurements, the transit method, and gravitational microlensing ⁠— we’ve surpassed 5000 known exoplanets: planets located beyond our own Solar System. As is often the case, these discoveries have been tremendous and have answered some of our deepest questions about the cosmos. Nevertheless, even deeper ones now remain. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.\n What do planets outside our solar system, or exoplanets, look like? A variety of possibilities are shown in this illustration. Scientists discovered the first exoplanets in the 1990s. As of 2024, the tally stands at over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets. None are known to be inhabited, but a few raise tantalizing possibilities: largely among the Earth-sized planets, but not so much among the larger ones.\n What is an exoplanet?\n In the early 1990s, two different methods, at almost the same time, started to reveal planets that were located beyond our own Solar System. Through measuring the periodic pulses coming from a neutron star, we could see that the pulses would regularly speed up, then return to normal speed, then slow down, and then return to normal speed again, over and over. The fact that these pulses changed with the same period and amplitude told us that there were massive companions in these pulsar systems, and by measuring the pulse timing, we could infer the masses of these companions: they were definitively planets.\n Similarly, we could observe the periodic redshifting and blueshifting of the light from individual stars, which also revealed the presence of massive planets, which “tugged”"
