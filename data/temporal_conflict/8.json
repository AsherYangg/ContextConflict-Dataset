However, there is a significant difference between male and female billionaires: whereas most of the former were “self-made”, close to 40 percent of the latter had inherited their fortune. Furthermore, when looking at the demographics of billionaires globally, only 13 percent were women. Finally, only about 10 percent of the billionaires worldwide were younger than 50 years old. As of March 2025, 20-year-old Clemente Del Vecchio was the world's youngest billionaire.\n While this is not necessarily the industry from which the billionaires earn their fortune, nearly one-fourth of the world's male billionaires devote most of their time to banking and financing. On the other hand, the first industry among female billionaires was non-profit and social organizations. Concerning asset allocation; almost 40 percent of the wealth of male billionaires is derived from public holdings, while the same was the case for only 22 percent of female billionaires.\n The “self-made” billionaire myth\nThe common narrative about “self-made” is that in opposition to billionaires who inherited their fortune, “self-made” billionaires came from nothing and earned their wealth by themselves, working harder than others. However, this narrative fails to take into consideration systemic inequalities. Indeed, most of today's billionaires benefited from their family wealth, privilege, and social connections to start their businesses. And then, their businesses were largely supported by labor exploitation, tax loopholes, and government subsidies.\n This text provides general information.
