This value is 0.15°C (0.27°F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014–2023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.\n This map shows 2023 temperatures compared to the 1991-2020 average. Most of the globe was warmer-than-average (red). Only a few areas were colder than average (blue). The animated bar graph shows yearly average temperature since 1976 compared to the 20th-century average. It's been 47 years—nearly half a century—since Earth's temperature was colder than average. 2023 set a new warmest-year record by a wide margin.\n Unlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode, also known as La Niña, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Niño, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Niño), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Niña years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Niña).",

(Image credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\nIt’s official: 2023 was the planet’s warmest year on record, according to an analysis by scientists from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).\n Along with the historic heat, Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to a record low in 2023.\n “After seeing the 2023 climate analysis, I have to pause and say that the findings are astounding,” said NOAA Chief Scientist Dr. Sarah Kapnick. “Not only was 2023 the warmest year in NOAA’s 174-year climate record — it was the warmest by far. A warming planet means we need to be prepared for the impacts of climate change that are happening here and now, like extreme weather events that become both more frequent and severe.\n \"We will continue to see records broken and extreme events grow until emissions go to zero,” Kapnick said. “Government policy can address both emissions, but also actions to reduce climate impacts by building resilience. \"\nBelow are highlights from NOAA’s 2023 annual global climate report:\nA world map plotted with color blocks depicting percentiles of global average land and ocean temperatures for the full year 2023.

There’s still more work to be done, but President Biden and communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risks and help communities become more resilient – and NASA will continue to use our vantage point of space to bring critical climate data back down to Earth that is understandable and accessible for all people. NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are working to protect our home planet and its people, for this generation – and the next.”\n In 2023, hundreds of millions of people around the world experienced extreme heat, and each month from June through December set a global record for the respective month. July was the hottest month ever recorded. Overall, Earth was about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.4 degrees Celsius) warmer in 2023 than the late 19th-century average, when modern record-keeping began.\n 2023 was Earth’s warmest year since modern record-keeping began around 1880, and the past 10 consecutive years have been the warmest 10 on record.

It highlights that the ambitions of the Paris Agreement are in great peril.\n “As monthly and annual warming temporarily surpass 1.5°C, it is important to emphasize that this does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement goal to keep the long- term global average surface temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the warming to 1.5°C,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.",

The top ten hottest years on record have happened in the last ten years, including 2024,” said Secretary-General António Guterres in his message for the New Year.\n “This is climate breakdown — in real time. We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose,” he gravely emphasised.\n Tweet URL\nWMO will publish the consolidated global temperature figure for 2024 in January and its full State of the Global Climate 2024 report in March 2025.\n Climate catastrophes\nThroughout 2024, a series of reports from the WMO community highlighted the rapid pace of climate change and its far-reaching impacts on every aspect of sustainable development.\n Record-breaking rainfalls were documented as well as catastrophic flooding, scorching heat waves with temperatures exceeding 50°C, and devastating wildfires.\n “This year we saw record-breaking rainfall and flooding events and terrible loss of life in so many countries, causing heartbreak to communities on every continent,” she stated.\n “Every fraction of a degree of warming matters, and increases climate extremes, impacts and risks,” she underscored.\n Hope amid crises\nDespite the grim realities, the year 2024 saw notable advancements with the adoption of the Pact for the Future - a landmark agreement to promote disarmament, financial reform, gender equality, and ethical technological innovation.\n The COP29 UN climate conference also recently discussed ways to increase finance for poor countries to support them in coping with the impacts of extreme weather.",
        "source_6": "2024 was the hottest year on record. Here’s whyIt's looking like 2024 will be the hottest year since record-keeping began, unseating 2023 for the top spot. Climate change is playing a role, and scientists say it was even hotter than expected.\n The average temperature across the globe in 2024 set a record. Climate change is helping drive longer and more intense heat waves.\n Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nPatrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n2023 was a chart-topper. A surge in global temperatures made it the hottest year since record-keeping began in the mid-1800s, producing heat that one scientist called \"gobsmackingly bananas. \"\nThen came 2024.\n Scientists say this year is almost certain to take over the top spot as the hottest year. The global average temperature could potentially breach a key threshold, reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. Countries have agreed to try to limit warming to below that level in order to avoid much more intense storms, rainfall and heat waves.\n The record-setting build up of heat has surprised scientists, setting off a climatic whodunit.\n Sponsor Message\nSome drivers are clear. A primary cause is the continued burning of fossil fuels, compounded by the natural El Niño climate pattern, which raised temperatures globally.\n But those factors alone may not account for the full surge in persistent heat seen this year, scientists say. They're now exploring what other factors may have contributed, from a volcanic eruption in the South Pacific to a lack of cloud cover that normally shields the planet from the sun's heat.\n \"It's getting tiring saying over and over again that it's the warmest, but it's important to know,\" says Jared Rennie, research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
