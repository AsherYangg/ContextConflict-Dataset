The first day of Yennayer corresponds to the first day of January in the Julian Calendar, which is shifted thirteen days compared to the Gregorian calendar, thus falling on 12 January every year. The Berber calendar was created in 1980 by Ammar Negadi, a Paris-based Algerian scholar.[1] He chose 943 BC (rounded off to 950), the year in which the MeshweshShoshenq I ascended to the throne of Egypt, as the first year of the Berber calendar.[1][2]\nThere is some debate about the traditional date of Yennayer, with some cultural associations advocating for its celebration on the evening of 13 January, which is widespread in Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and the Canary Islands.\n On 27 December 2017, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika officially recognized Yennayer as a public holiday to be celebrated on 12 January every year.[3] The first official celebration of Yennayer as a public holiday in Algeria took place on 12 January 2018.[4] On 3 May 2023, King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared the Berber New Year as a national public holiday in Morocco.[5][6]\nOrigins\nThe Berber Academy was established with the intention of recognizing Yennayer as the \"Amazigh New Year,\" based on the longstanding tradition of North Africans celebrating the event each year. In 1980, Ammar Negadi proposed the creation of a Berber calendar.[7]\nCelebration\nOne of the most significant aspects of Yennayer is the preparation of a special meal, which is hearty and different from everyday ones. The Kabyle people of Algeria, for example, use the meat of the sacrificed animal (asfel) to complement couscous.",
        "source_3": "Berber New Year\nBerber New Year is a holiday that falls annually on January 12th in Algeria and celebrates the incoming year on the Berber calendar—an agricultural calendar traditionally used by the Amazigh ethnic group. The start of the year is celebrated in various ways from country to country, but some of the more common celebrations include sacrificing an animal, such as a chicken, and serving a couscous dish with seven different vegetables. This holiday is a public holiday in many places, and schools and government offices are closed.\n The History of Berber New Year\nThe Berber Calendar is an agricultural calendar that is known as the fellahi or “rustic calendar.” It is believed that this calendar is based on the Julian Calendar—a calendar that was introduced in the Roman province of Africa that was established in 146 BC. This Roman province was established during the Third Punic War after the defeat of Carthage. This territory was made up of present-day Tunisia, the coast of western Libya, and the northeast portion of Algeria and was occupied by the Berber people.\n The length of the year on the Berber calendar is the same as on the Julian calendar. There is one slight discrepancy: the extra day in leap years is not added at the end of February but is added at the end of the year instead. That means that the Berber New Year, or the first day of Yennayer, corresponds to the 14th day of January in the Gregorian calendar. This coincides with the offset accumulated over the centuries between the Julian calendar and the observed astronomical dates.\n In most countries that use the Julian calendar, which the Berber calendar was originally based on, the New Year is usually observed on the 14th of January. No one knows why in Algeria these celebrations are held on the 12th of January, but there are some theories. Some people think that the Berber calendar dates back to the victory achieved by Amazigh King Sheshonq I against the Pharaoh in a battle that was conducted in 950 BC on the banks of the Nile.",
        "source_4": "Starting on Tuesday 12 January, Amazigh people in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, and parts of Egypt, as well as the diaspora, will celebrate Yennayer, the Amazigh new year.\n The year 2021 in the Gregorian calendar marks the year 2971 for the Amazigh, who are also known as the Imazighen.\nDating back to antiquity, the celebration is rooted in North African folktales and legend, and represents the bond between the Imazighen and the land they live upon, as well as the earth’s wealth and generosity. Yennayer is therefore a festival of nature, agrarian life, rebirth and abundance.\n In recent times, the celebration of Yennayer has taken on an added significance as a way of keeping the Amazigh cultural identity alive.\n The term \"Yennayer\" is also the name given to the first month of the Amazigh calendar.\n New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on\nIsrael-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n When is Yennayer?\n The evening preceding Yennayer is an occasion known as \"Thabbourth Aseggas\" (the door of the year) by the Kabyles of Algeria or \"Id Suggas\" by Amazigh groups in Morocco. This event falls on 12 January and marks the start of the celebrations in Algeria. The official state holiday of Yennayer in Algeria also coincides with Thabbourth Aseggas on 12 January.\n Some Amazigh groups in Morocco and elsewhere start their celebrations on 13 January.\n Etymologically, the word \"Yennayer\" is believed to be a combination of the Amazigh words \"Yenn\" (One) and \"Ayur\" (month). An alternative explanation is that the word is a borrowing from the Latin \"Ianuarius\", from which the word January in English and \"Yanayir\" in Arabic are ultimately derived.",
        "source_5": "Yennayer 2971: Berber New Year in North Africa\nIn North Africa among the Berbers, the January 12th is the 1st day of the year 2971 of the Amazigh (Berber) calendar which begins in 950 BC, date of the victory of the Berber king Chachnaq over the pharaoh Ramses III where the Berber king Sheshonq I was enthroned Pharaoh of Egypt and founded the XXII Dynasty which ruled Egypt until 715 BC.\nBy Rabah Arkam\nThis Berber king had succeeded in unifying Egypt and then invading the kingdom of Israel. He is said to have captured the treasures of Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem in 926 BC. This date is mentioned in the Bible and would therefore constitute the first date in Berber history on a written medium. King Sheshonq is referred to in the Bible as Sésaq and Shishaq in ancient Hebrew. This Berber New Year is called “Yennayer”, etymologically, the name is made up of “Yen”, which means “first”, and “Ayer”, which means “month”.\n Long marginalized by regimes acquired in the Arab-Muslim ideology, that each year, the Islamists launch a campaign against the celebration of Yennayer, declaring this festival a sin (haram) which does not prevent this festival from being more and more most popular.\n The Berbers of North Africa today try to give shape to their history and their identity within society to celebrate the New Year Yennayer marks New Year’s Day on the agrarian calendar, used since antiquity by Berber. It corresponds to the 12th day of January of the Julian calendar, like the Gregorian calendar, the Berber calendar is divided into twelve months and has been used since Antiquity by the peoples of North Africa (Kabyles, Riffs, Tuaregs, Siwa…).\n Families traditionally share a meal based on poultry couscous called (Imensi n’Yennayer) where the whole family gets together. It is customary to leave a ration and a spoon for anyone absent, distant relative or passing poor.",
