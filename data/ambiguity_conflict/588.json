    "source_1": "Optical projection tomography Optical projection tomography is a form of tomography involving optical microscopy. The OPT technique is sometimes referred to as Optical Computed Tomography (optical-CT) and Optical Emission Computed Tomography (optical-ECT) in the literature, to address the fact that the technique bears similarity to X-ray computed tomography (CT) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It is in many ways the optical equivalent of X-ray computed tomography or the medical CT scan. OPT differs in the way that it often uses ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared photons as opposed to X-ray photons. However, essential mathematics and reconstruction algorithms used for CT",

However, because of various mismatches such as that between the fiscal and academic year, and between the date of approval and the start date, and the fact that the \"Open Doors\" survey does not cover all SEVP-certified institutions, the numbers may not exactly match those from the GAO table. The STEM extension was announced in a memo by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on April 2, 2008, published in the \"Federal Register\" issue of Tuesday, April",

Unlike CPAP, oral pressure therapy does not apply pressure directly to the airway, but applies light negative pressure in the oral cavity. With this system, the user breathes normally through the nose with the mouth closed. Unlike mandibular repositioning devices (also known as oral appliances and dental devices), oral pressure therapy does not pull the lower jaw forward. One oral pressure therapy device",

These structures are unique and were specifically designed for use at the OPT. In its original state, there were five of these extendible gangways attached to the terminal. During the 1988 refurbishment two of these extendible gangways were removed and relocated to the Wharf 13 at Pyrmont and Wharf 10 at Darling Harbour. One criticism of the two remaining extendible gangways highlighted that while \"the industrial nature of the"
