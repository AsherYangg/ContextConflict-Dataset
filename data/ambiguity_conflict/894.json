    "source_1": "Ambient isotopy In the mathematical subject of topology, an ambient isotopy, also called an \"h-isotopy\", is a kind of continuous distortion of an ambient space, for example a manifold, taking a submanifold to another submanifold. For example in knot theory, one considers two knots the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy. More precisely, let \"N\" and \"M\" be manifolds and \"g\" and \"h\" be embeddings of \"N\" in \"M\". A continuous map is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking \"g\" to \"h\"",
    "source_2": "Regular isotopy In the mathematical subject of knot theory, regular isotopy is the equivalence relation of link diagrams that is generated by using the 2nd and 3rd Reidemeister moves only. The notion of regular isotopy was introduced by Louis Kauffman (Kauffman 1990). It can be thought of as an isotopy of a ribbon pressed flat against the plane which keeps the ribbon flat. For diagrams in the plane this is a finer equivalence relation than ambient isotopy of framed links, since the 2nd and 3rd Reidemeister moves preserve the winding number of the diagram (Kauffman 1990, pp. 450ff.). However, for",
    "source_3": "the notion of knot equivalence is that one can \"deform\" one embedding to another through a path of embeddings: a continuous function starting at \"t\" = 0 giving the \"K\" embedding, ending at \"t\" = 1 giving the \"K\" embedding, with all intermediate values corresponding to embeddings. This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. An ambient isotopy, studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots \"K\" and \"K\" are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves \"K\" to \"K\". This is the appropriate",
    "source_4": "Isotopy of an algebra In mathematics, an isotopy from a possibly non-associative algebra \"A\" to another is a triple of bijective linear maps such that if then . This is similar to the definition of an isotopy of loops, except that it must also preserve the linear structure of the algebra. For this is the same as an isomorphism. The autotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies to itself (sometimes called autotopies), which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup. Isotopy of algebras was introduced by , who was inspired by work of Steenrod. Some"
