Few details are known of his life: after the death of St Nicholas I, he was briefly exiled from Rome at the behest of the emperor Louis II, but was recalled by Adrian II. Possessed of considerable learning, he was closely associated with Anastasius, Librarian of the Roman Church (died 879).

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913): The oldest chronicle of Venice, known as the \"Chronicon Sagornini\", was compiled by deacon John, the chaplain and perhaps a relative of the Doge Pietro II Orseolo (991–1009).
