    "source_1": "Kolmogorov extension theorem In mathematics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem (also known as Kolmogorov existence theorem or Kolmogorov consistency theorem) is a theorem that guarantees that a suitably \"consistent\" collection of finite-dimensional distributions will define a stochastic process. It is credited to the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov. Let formula_1 denote some interval (thought of as \"time\"), and let formula_2. For each formula_3 and finite sequence of distinct times formula_4, let formula_5 be a probability measure on formula_6. Suppose that these measures satisfy two consistency conditions: 1. for all permutations formula_7 of formula_8 and measurable sets formula_9, 2. for all measurable",

The theorem states that every strict partial order is contained into a total order, where: Intuitively, the theorem states that a comparison between elements that leaves some pairs incomparable can be extended in such a way every element is either less than or greater than another. A binary relation \"R\" over a set \"S\" is formally defined as"
