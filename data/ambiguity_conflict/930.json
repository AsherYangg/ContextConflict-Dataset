The primary shear extends in excess of 50 km and has displacements of several kilometres interpreted from the geology either side of the fault contact. The shear is also readily identified from the aerial magnetic data as zones of demagnetisation. A secondary cross cutting northeast trending fault terminates the eastern end of the prominent BIF horizon. This 0600 orientation is an important control on mineralisation which is known to host gold resources elsewhere in the Mara-Musoma goldfield. Rocks of the Karagwe–Ankolean Supergroup host most of the known nickel, copper, PGE, and tin mineralisation in Tanzania. This Supergroup",

There is a human vaccine; however, as of 2010 it is not widely available. There is no specific treatment and medical efforts are supportive. Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia. Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increase the number of mosquitoes. The disease was first reported among livestock in Rift Valley of Kenya in the early"
