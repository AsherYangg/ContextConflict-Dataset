In humans, granzyme B is encoded by GZMB on chromosome 14q.11.2, which is 3.2kb long and consists of 5 exons. It is one of the most abundant granzymes of which there are 5 in humans and 10 in mice. Granzyme B is thought to have evolved from a granzyme H related precursor and is more effective at lower concentrations than the other granzymes. The enzyme is initially in an inactive precursor zymogen form, with an",

A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.
