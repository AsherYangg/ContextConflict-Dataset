It is mainly used as a solvent and as a source of materials for organic synthesis. Turpentine is composed of terpenes, mainly the monoterpenes alpha-pinene and beta-pinene with lesser amounts of carene, camphene, dipentene, and terpinolene. The word \"turpentine\" derives (via French and Latin) from the Greek word τερεβινθίνη \"terebinthine\", the feminine form (to go with the feminine Greek word for resin) of an adjective τερεβίνθινος derived from the Greek noun",
