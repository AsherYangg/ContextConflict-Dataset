In North America, sarsaparilla originates in Southern Mexico, being found primarily in the states of Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucatán, Nuevo León, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo. In El Salvador, sarsaparilla is located in Hacienda San Jose, Santa Ana. Its roots are extracted to be used in flavoring beverages, dairy desserts, baked goods and candies. Sarsaparilla was once a main ingredient for flavoring root beer. However, the taste of the root extract itself is sweet and bitter. \"Smilax",

They occur in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Oceania and Polynesia. These are large trees or shrubs. In Australia, they are often called \"ash trees\" or \"sarsaparilla trees\". This is rather misleading however; among the flowering plants, \"Alphitonia\" is not closely related to the true ash trees (\"Fraxinus\" of the asterids), and barely at all to the monocot sarsaparilla vines (\"Smilax\"). The name is derived from a Greek word meaning \"pearl barley\". The lanceolate coriaceous leaves are alternate, about 12",

The roots have been used as substitutes for true Sarsaparilla (\"Smilax\" sp.) in herbal medicine. This plant is so common in certain ecologies that it is an indicator species for these Eastern Forests of North America: Northern Hardwood Forest, Beech-Maple Forest, and Oak-Hickory Forest. Because it sometimes grows with groups of 3 leaflets, it can be mistaken for poison ivy; the way to tell the difference is that Wild Sarsaparilla lacks a woody base and has fine teeth along",
