The party was formed on 15 March 1990 during the twelfth Knesset by five MKs who had broken away from Likud. Originally known as the Party for the Advancement of the Zionist Idea, all five MKs were former members of the original Liberal Party, which had merged into Likud in 1988. Despite breaking away from his party, the new faction joined Yitzhak Shamir's government, with Yitzhak Moda'i appointed Minister of Finance. On 18 June 1990 Avraham Sharir returned",
