First attested as a Gothic name in the 5th century, it became widespread in the Germanic-speaking world, not least due to its most famous bearer, Theoderic the Great, king of the Ostrogoths.

Gregory of Tours Latinized the name as \"Theodorus\", in origin the unrelated Greek name Theodore (Θεόδωρος, meaning \"god-gift\"). As",
