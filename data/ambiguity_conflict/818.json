The maximum areal storage density for flash memory used in solid state drives (SSDs) is 2.8 Tbit/in in laboratory demonstrations as of 2016, and the maximum for HDDs is 1.5 Tbit/in. The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) and faster than the 10–20% per year for HDDs. As of 2016, maximum capacity was 10 terabytes for an HDD, and 15 terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in"
