    "source_1": "trade. Rosslare Harbour railway station opened on 30 August 1906. Although the harbour itself is located close to the previously existing settlement of Ballygeary, and actually in the townland of Ballygillane Big, it was named after the village of Rosslare, some 4 km away (8 km by road) along the coast. The village of Ballygeary was divided into two townslands, one known as tin town and the other as straw town. It is believed this was because of the roofs on the houses. The village has a number of guesthouses, hotels, a Roman Catholic church, a bank and some shops.",
