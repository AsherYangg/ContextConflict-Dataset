    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue for the past 6 months. During this period, she has had a 5-kg (11-lbs) weight loss. She states that she has no friends. When she is not in school, she spends most of her time in bed. She has no history of serious illness. Her mother has major depressive disorder. She appears pale and thin. She is at 25th percentile for height, 10th percentile for weight, and 20th percentile for BMI; her BMI is 19.0. Her temperature is 37В°C (98.6В°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows dry skin, brittle nails, and calluses on the knuckles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.3 g/dL\nSerum\nNa+ 133 mEq/L\nCl- 90 mEq/L\nK+ 3.2 mEq/L\nHCO3- 30 mEq/L\nCa+2 7.8 mg/dL\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "The presented case involves a 17-year-old girl experiencing fatigue, significant weight loss, and social withdrawal, which can indicate psychological issues such as depression or eating disorders. Moreover, she has a family history of major depressive disorder. Her physical examination reveals signs that suggest a possible eating disorder - she is pale and thin with a BMI at the 20th percentile, and she has dry skin, brittle nails, and knuckle calluses (from self-induced vomiting, a practice common in bulimia nervosa).\n\nHer laboratory findings, however, further guide our diagnosis. She has hypokalemia (low potassium), which is common in people with bulimia nervosa due to excessive vomiting leading to loss of gastric content, and metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate), also consistent with excessive vomiting. Although her calcium level is slightly low, this might be secondary to malnutrition. Thus, the combination of psychological, physical, and laboratory findings make bulimia nervosa the most likely diagnosis.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with weight loss, isolation, lack of friends, and a mother with a history of major depressive disorder, which may suggest psychological distress. The clinical findings of dry skin, brittle nails, calluses on the knuckles (Russell's sign), and the below-average body mass index (BMI) for her age are suggestive of a disorder characterized by self-induced starvation. These symptoms together strongly indicate anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, the laboratory studies show electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia (K+ 3.2 mEq/L, normally 3.5-5 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 30 mEq/L, normally 22-28 mEq/L), which can result from malnutrition and purging behaviors often associated with this condition.",
        "source_3": "The differential diagnosis for this patient could include major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and chronic fatigue syndrome. She has symptoms consistent with depression (fatigue, social isolation, family history of depression) but also physical findings suggestive of anorexia nervosa (underweight, weight loss, calluses on the knuckles which may indicate induced vomiting - a feature of bulimia nervosa which can be present in some anorexia nervosa patients as well, dry skin, brittle nails, and a slightly decreased potassium level). Her BMI being on the 20th percentile is compatible with underweight status. Chronic fatigue syndrome is less likely given the physical findings more consistent with anorexia nervosa. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is anorexia nervosa.",
        "source_4": "This patient's symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, social isolation, appearance of being pale and thin, along with dry skin, brittle nails, and calluses on the knuckles are all suggestive of a possible eating disorder. Specifically, the presence of calluses on the knuckles is often seen in bulimia nervosa due to self-induced vomiting, known as Russell's sign. However, the lack of binge eating episodes in the history provided points more towards anorexia nervosa. Additionally, her mother's history of major depressive disorder can be relevant as mood disorders are often comorbid with eating disorders. Furthermore, the decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and slightly elevated bicarbonate levels could be related to compensatory changes due to malnutrition and the possibility of purging behaviors. Her body mass index (BMI) is also on the lower side (20th percentile), another hint towards anorexia nervosa."
