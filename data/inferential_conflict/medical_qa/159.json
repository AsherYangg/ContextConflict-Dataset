    "question": "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 31 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department because of confusion. Three days ago, she developed diffuse abdominal pain, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. She has a 2-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Four months ago, she spent 2 weeks in Belize for her honeymoon. Her previous pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia, which was terminated by induction of labor at 37 weeks' gestation. Her only medication is esomeprazole. She appears tired. Her temperature is 38В°C (100В°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 118/79 mm Hg. She responds to sound and communicates in short sentences. Examination shows yellowish discoloration of the sclera and abdominal distention. There is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant. When she is asked to hold her hands in extension, there is a notable flapping tremor. Her uterus is consistent in size with a 31-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:\nHematocrit 26%\nPlatelet count 90,000/mm3\nLeukocyte count 10,500/mm3\nProthrombin time (PT) 34 seconds\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT) 48 seconds\nSerum\nTotal protein 5.0 g/dL\nAlbumin 2.6 g/dL\nGlucose 62 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2.1 mg/dL\nBilirubin, total 9.2 mg/dL\nIndirect 4.2 mg/dL\nAspartate aminotransferase 445 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 485 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 36 U/L\nAnti-HAV IgM antibody negative\nAnti-HAV IgG antibody positive\nHBsAG negative\nAnti-HBs antibody positive\nAnti-HBc antibody negative\nAnti-HCV antibody negative\nUrine studies show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: acute liver failure, HELLP syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), cholestasis of pregnancy, and viral hepatitis. Her travel history and the positive anti-HAV IgG antibody suggest previous exposure to Hepatitis A but the negative anti-HAV IgM antibody suggests that there is no current active infection. Her liver enzyme levels are elevated suggesting some sort of hepatocellular injury. Her yellowish discoloration of the sclera and increased total bilirubin indicate jaundice, which is a sign of liver disease. The confusion, low glucose level, and flapping tremor suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which typically occurs in the setting of acute or chronic liver failure. The prothrombin time (PT) is increased indicating a decrease in liver synthetic function. The symptoms are sudden which makes chronic liver disease less likely. The absence of hypertension and proteinuria makes HELLP syndrome less likely. She doesn't have itching, making cholestasis of pregnancy less likely. Given the sudden onset of her symptoms, the hepatocellular injury, the hepatic encephalopathy, and the absence of a viral cause, she most likely has Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP), a potentially life-threatening condition that typically presents in the third trimester or immediate postpartum period.",
        "source_2": "The patient's presentation includes jaundice, confusion, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, all signs of liver disease. The flapping tremor, or asterixis, suggests hepatic encephalopathy, which is usually a sign of severe liver disease. The elevated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels along with the low albumin level, increased prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) also support liver dysfunction. The hepatitis serologies indicate past infection (or vaccination) with Hepatitis A and immunity to Hepatitis B, but no current infection with hepatitis A, B, or C.\n\nThe fact that she recently traveled to Belize is also relevant. This area has a high incidence of Hepatitis E, which can cause acute liver disease and is particularly severe in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester. Hepatitis E infection is usually self-limiting, but in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, it can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. The hepatitis E virus is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as through contaminated water, which she may have been exposed to during her recent travel.\n\nGiven the lack of other clear causes for acute liver failure in this patient, her recent travel history, and the severity of the presentation, acute Hepatitis E infection would be a likely diagnosis."
