    "question": "A newborn infant presents with severe weakness. He was born to a G1P1 mother at 40 weeks gestation with the pregnancy attended by a midwife. The mother's past medical history is unremarkable. She took a prenatal vitamin and folic acid throughout the pregnancy. Since birth, the child has had trouble breastfeeding despite proper counseling. He also has had poor muscle tone and a weak cry. His temperature is 99.5В°F (37.5В°C), blood pressure is 57/38 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 37/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Physical exam reveals poor muscle tone. The patient's sucking reflex is weak, and an enlarged tongue is noted. An ultrasound is performed, and is notable for hypertrophy of the myocardium. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The newborn's presentation includes weakness, poor muscle tone, difficulty feeding, weak cry, an enlarged tongue, and myocardial hypertrophy. These symptoms are indicative of a condition that affects muscle strength and development. These symptoms, along with hypertrophy of the myocardium (thickening of the heart muscle), suggest a diagnosis of infantile-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can be a manifestation of a metabolic disorder. The most likely cause in this context, given the age of onset and presenting features, is Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type II). Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, which is necessary for the breakdown of glycogen within lysosomes. The buildup of glycogen particularly affects muscle cells, including cardiac muscle, leading to the symptoms seen in this newborn.",
        "source_2": "This infant presents with severe weakness, difficulty feeding, hypotonia (poor muscle tone), macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of infantile hypothyroidism, also known as congenital hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism in newborns can result from a variety of causes including thyroid dysgenesis (a developmental anomaly of the thyroid gland), dyshormonogenesis (an inborn error of thyroid hormone production), or maternal factors such as antithyroid drugs or maternal autoimmune thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate thyroid hormone, infants can exhibit delayed development and growth. The hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and macroglossia are all due to the general slowing down of processes in the body due to lack of thyroid hormone. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a less common finding, but can occur as a result of the body trying to compensate for the slowed metabolism.",
        "source_3": "The differential diagnosis for a newborn presenting with severe weakness, poor feeding, enlarged tongue, poor muscle tone and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy includes: congenital myopathies, metabolic disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital hypothyroidism. Considering the symptomatology, congenital hypothyroidism and metabolic disorders are less likely as they typically do not cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Spinal muscular atrophy is a possibility; however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not typically seen in this condition. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a congenital myopathy, more specifically, infantile botulism due to the presence of a weak cry, poor sucking reflex, generalized weakness, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
        "source_4": "This newborn is presenting with severe generalized weakness, poor feeding, poor muscle tone, weak cry, macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and hypertrophy of the myocardium. These are symptoms suggestive of congenital hypothyroidism, also known as cretinism. In severe cases, babies may present with hoarse cry and large tongue. Hypothyroidism in neonates can also lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the heart. This condition is typically identified on newborn screening tests, but if it went undiagnosed, these would be the signs and symptoms one would expect."
