    "question": "A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5В° C (97.7В° F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. There are numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right-upper sternal border. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 7.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 89 Ојm3\nReticulocyte count 13.3%\nSerum\nSodium 139 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.5 mg/dL\nTest of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "The patient's signs and symptoms point towards chronic blood loss, which is not likely gastrointestinal due to the negative test for occult blood. The most telling symptom is the presence of crusts along the course of her left arm veins, which is indicative of self-induced injection of blood. This, combined with her fear of having cancer (despite no supportive diagnostic evidence), depression, and the high stress from work suggests a psychiatric disorder called factitious disorder imposed on self, formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome. This is a mental illness, in which a person repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental disorder when, in truth, he or she has caused the symptoms. The low hemoglobin and high reticulocyte count (body's response to anemia) support this theory. The murmur heard could be due to increased blood flow velocity due to anemia.",
        "source_2": "This 26-year-old nurse presents with a 2-month history of fatigue, numerous episodes of lower abdominal pain, and a depressed mood. She is also found to be pale with dry mucous membranes and generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Her significant findings include pale conjunctivae, crusts along the veins of her left arm, a systolic ejection murmur, and a markedly low hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL. The crusts along the veins in her arm suggest intravenous drug use. Given her symptoms and presentation, this combination is highly suggestive of a condition called infectious endocarditis. The combination of anemia, possible intravenous drug use, and the presence of a murmur (suggesting valvular disease) strongly point to this diagnosis. The reticulocyte count is high, indicating the body is responding to the anemia by producing more red blood cells. Endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users, often involves the tricuspid valve, which could account for the murmur heard along the right-upper sternal border.",
        "source_3": "This patient's presentation of fatigue, pale conjunctivae, low blood pressure, high pulse rate, and low hemoglobin indicate anemia. Her elevated reticulocyte count indicates the body's response to this anemia, attempting to produce more red blood cells. The presence of crusts along her veins suggests repeated intravenous access, which, along with her occupation as a nurse, raises the possibility of self-administered injections and potential illicit substance use. Importantly, generalized weakness of the proximal muscles can indicate muscle damage or inflammation, which could be due to multiple causes, including autoimmune, infectious, or drug-induced myopathy. In the context of this patient's potential access to drugs and her anemia, her presentation might suggest a diagnosis of chronic intravenous drug use leading to drug-induced myopathy and secondary anemia.",
        "source_4": "This patient presents with a combination of symptoms: fatigue, pale conjunctivae, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and a heart murmur, all of which suggest anemia. The elevated reticulocyte count is consistent with this diagnosis, indicating that the body is attempting to produce more red blood cells to compensate for their loss. However, the occult blood test is negative, suggesting that the anemia is not caused by a gastrointestinal bleed.\n\nThe patient's history of working as a nurse and the presence of \"numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins\" are strong indicators of intravenous drug use, which could lead to recurrent blood loss, infections, and endocarditis.\n\nEndocarditis can lead to a systolic ejection murmur as heard in this case, as well as a type of anemia known as anemia of chronic disease (also called anemia of inflammation). This is a type of anemia that can occur with long-term diseases that involve inflammation, infection, or malignancy, and in this case, could be due to recurrent infections from IV drug use. However, the high reticulocyte count goes against this form of anemia as it's usually normocytic with a low reticulocyte count.\n\nAlternatively, the anemia could also be related to chronic blood loss due to the IV drug use, which would lead to iron deficiency anemia, a type of microcytic anemia. However, the MCV is normal in this case, so this is less likely.\n\nAnother possibility could be hemolytic anemia which is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their usual lifespan is over. A high reticulocyte count is a sign of increased red blood cell production by the bone marrow, and is typically seen in hemolytic anemias.\n\nThe generalized weakness of the proximal muscles could also suggest some form of muscle disease, but the primary indicators in this case seem to point to anemia associated with IV drug use and possible endocarditis."
