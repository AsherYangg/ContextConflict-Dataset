    "question": "A 2-day old male newborn delivered vaginally at 36 weeks to a 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, has generalized convulsions lasting 2 minutes. Previous to the event, he had difficulty feeding and was lethargic. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Pregnancy and delivery of the mother's first 2 children were also uncomplicated. Medications of the mother include folic acid and a multivitamin. The mother's immunizations are up-to-date. The infant appears icteric. His vital signs are within normal limits. The infant's weight and length are at the 5th percentile, and his head circumference at the 99th percentile for gestational age. There are several purpura of the skin. Ocular examination shows posterior uveitis. The patient does not pass his auditory screening tests. Cranial ultrasonography shows ventricular dilatation, as well as hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The 2-day old newborn has several symptoms and findings that are suggestive of a congenital infection. These include difficulty in feeding, lethargy, convulsions, icterus, purpura on the skin, posterior uveitis, and abnormal cranial ultrasonography with ventricular dilatation and hyperechoic foci. These findings are characteristic of Congenital Toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which the infant could have acquired in utero from the mother. Congenital Toxoplasmosis classically presents with the triad of chorioretinitis (inflammation of the eyes), hydrocephalus (ventricular dilatation) and intracranial calcifications (hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region). The icterus and purpura on the skin may indicate liver involvement or hematologic manifestations. The patientХs failure to pass auditory screening tests also aligns with this diagnosis, as hearing impairment can be a feature of congenital toxoplasmosis.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnoses for this newborn with generalized convulsions, difficulty feeding, lethargy, icterus, purpura, posterior uveitis, ventricular dilatation, and hyperechoic foci in the brain include hypoglycemia, neonatal sepsis, kernicterus, hypocalcemia, and congenital infections like toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes (TORCH infections). Hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia could lead to convulsions, but they would not account for the ocular findings or cranial ultrasonography results. Neonatal sepsis could explain some findings, but the characteristic ocular findings and brain changes make this less likely. Kernicterus, a severe form of jaundice, would cause icterus and lethargy but wouldnХt account for the purpura or ocular findings. The constellation of symptoms including purpura, ocular changes, and brain changes in the newborn are characteristic of TORCH infections, specifically congenital CMV infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection often leads to intrauterine growth restriction (consistent with the infant's weight at the 5th percentile), microcephaly, periventricular calcifications (hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region on cranial ultrasonography), and hearing loss, which are present in this patient."
