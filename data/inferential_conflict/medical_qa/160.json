    "question": "A 74-year-old right-handed woman was referred to the hospital due to concerns of a stroke. In the emergency department, the initial vital signs included blood pressure of 159/98 mm Hg, heart rate of 88/min, and respiratory rate of 20/min. She exhibited paucity of speech and apathy to her condition, although she complied with her physical examination. The initial neurologic evaluation included the following results:\nAwake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time\nNo visual field deficits\nRight-sided gaze deviation with full range of motion with dollвЂ™s head maneuver\nNo facial asymmetry\nGrossly intact hearing\nNo tongue deviation, equal palatal elevation, and good guttural sound production\nAbsent pronator or lower extremity drift\nDecreased sensation to light touch on the right leg\nNormal appreciation of light touch, pressure, and pain\nNormal proprioception and kinesthesia\nManual muscle testing:\n5+ right and left upper extremities\n5+ right hip, thigh, leg, and foot\n3+ left hip and thigh\n2+ left leg and foot\nA head computed tomography (CT) scan and a head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed areas of ischemia. Which artery is the most likely site of occlusion?",

        "source_1": "In assessing a possible stroke, it's important to connect the signs and symptoms to the vascular territories in the brain. This patient's signs and symptoms are suggestive of a stroke that has affected her left lower extremity more than her right, in addition to a right-sided gaze deviation. The neurologic findings suggest an issue predominantly on the left side of the brain, as the brain controls the opposite side of the body and gaze direction.\n\nThe prior probability of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is the highest, given that it's the most common site of cerebrovascular accidents. However, given the symptoms, this doesn't fit the typical MCA syndrome, which usually involves the upper extremities and face more than the lower extremities, and could also involve language dysfunction if it occurs in the dominant hemisphere.\n\nAnterior cerebral artery (ACA) strokes classically present with more severe motor and sensory deficits in the contralateral lower extremity than the upper extremity, as observed in this patient. Additionally, the presence of right-sided gaze deviation may indicate a frontal eye field involvement, which is supplied by the ACA.\n\nBy using Bayesian inference, we start with a certain probability for each type of stroke, then modify this probability based on the patient's symptoms. Here, the symptoms significantly increase the probability of the ACA being the site of occlusion.",
        "source_2": "This patient's symptoms include right-sided gaze deviation and decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, along with decreased strength in the left hip, thigh, leg, and foot. She also presents with ischemic changes on neuroimaging. The clinical manifestations suggest an issue with the left hemisphere of the brain, as it controls the right field of gaze and the right side of the body.\n\nThe fact that she also has muscle weakness in her left lower extremities indicates an issue with the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for voluntary motor control. In the brain, the corticospinal tract originates from the motor cortex.\n\nThe distribution of sensory and motor symptoms indicates a lesion in a part of the brain supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA is one of the three major paired arteries that supply blood to the cerebrum and it primarily supplies the lateral convexity of the hemisphere, which includes the primary motor and sensory areas for the face and upper extremities as well as areas controlling gaze. Hence, an occlusion in the left MCA could cause these symptoms.",
        "source_3": "The patient's symptoms include a right-sided gaze deviation and decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, which indicates a left-sided brain lesion due to the contralateral control of the brain. Also, there is weakness in the left lower extremity, which again points to a lesion on the right side of the brain. More specifically, these signs and symptoms point to an area called the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, as it supplies the frontal eye field (which would cause gaze deviation when affected) and parts of the sensory and motor cortices, which could explain the sensory deficit and muscle weakness. Therefore, the most likely site of occlusion is the left middle cerebral artery."
