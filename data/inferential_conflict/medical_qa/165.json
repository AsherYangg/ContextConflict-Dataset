    "question": "A 53-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son for the evaluation of unusual behavior. He is a shopkeeper by profession and sometimes behaves very rudely to the customers. Recently, he accused one of the customers of using black magic over his shop. He has been increasingly irritable, forgetting things, and having problems managing his finances over the past 8 months. He is also having difficulty finding words and recalling the names of objects during the conversation. There is no history of recent head trauma, fever, hallucinations, or abnormal limb movements. Past medical history is significant for a well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Family history is unremarkable. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 134/76 mm Hg, a heart rate of 88/min, and a temperature of 37.0В°C (98.6В°F). On physical examination, he has problems naming objects and planning tasks. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score is 26/30. Cranial nerve examination is normal. Muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs with normal muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. Sensory examination is also normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "This patient's declining cognitive abilities, increasing irritability, word-finding difficulties, and difficulties with task planning over the past 8 months are all symptoms of dementia. His normal cranial nerve and sensory examinations, as well as the absence of any motor issues, rule out other neurological conditions, such as stroke. Since the patient has problems with naming objects (anomia) and planning tasks (executive function), which are features primarily related to frontal and temporal lobe dysfunction, the most likely diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Also known as Pick's disease, FTD often presents with personality changes and language difficulties prior to memory impairment, unlike other forms of dementia like Alzheimer's. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is frontotemporal dementia.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of a neurodegenerative condition like Alzheimer's disease in this patient is around 10%. However, his presentation of forgetfulness, difficulty finding words and managing finances, and behavioral changes (rudeness, unusual accusations), all which have been going on for 8 months, raises the likelihood of a progressive cognitive disorder to around 40%. The fact that he has problems with naming objects (anomia) and planning tasks (executive function) is suggestive of issues with both language and executive functioning, which increases the probability further to 60%. His score on the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) being 26/30 indicates mild cognitive impairment, increasing the probability to 70%. Since there's no indication of motor symptoms, hallucinations, or sensory deficits, conditions like Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia are less likely. Likewise, there's no recent head trauma or abnormal limb movements to suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus or prion diseases. Hence, the most likely diagnosis is a form of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease, given the symptomatology."
