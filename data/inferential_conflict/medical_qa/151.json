    "question": "A 15-year-old male adolescent presents to the pediatrician with his parents complaining that he is shorter than his peers. His past medical history does not suggest any specific recurrent or chronic disease. There is no history of weight gain, weight loss, constipation, dry skin, headache. Both his parents are of normal height. On physical examination, he is a well-fed, well-developed male and his vital signs are within normal range. His physical examination is completely normal. His sexual development corresponds to Tanner stage 2. Analysis of his growth charts suggests that his height and weight at birth were within normal range. After the age of six months, his height and weight curves drifted further from average and approached the 5th percentile. An X-ray of the patientвЂ™s left hand reveals delayed bone age. What is the most likely cause of short stature in the boy?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The prior probability of constitutional growth delay (CGD) given the boy's age, gender, and complaint of short stature is about 20%. His Tanner stage being at 2 for a 15-year-old boy increases the probability of CGD to about 40%, since delayed puberty is common in CGD. The absence of any systemic disease symptoms like weight gain, weight loss, constipation, or dry skin reduces the likelihood of pathological causes of short stature, increasing the probability of CGD to about 60%. The parents being of normal height further supports this, increasing the probability to 80%. Finally, the X-ray showing delayed bone age is highly indicative of CGD, raising the probability to 90%. The patient's growth curve showing a consistent pattern of growth, although at a lower percentile than average, is also typical of CGD. Therefore, the most likely cause of short stature in this boy is constitutional growth delay.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with short stature compared to his peers but no evidence of systemic disease or dysmorphic features. Both his parents have normal height, suggesting that the cause of his short stature is not familial short stature. His growth curve shows a decrease in growth velocity since the age of six months, which is more suggestive of a systemic cause rather than a constitutional growth delay. The fact that he is well-fed and well-developed indicates that malnutrition is not the cause. His delayed bone age, as shown on X-ray, further supports a systemic cause rather than constitutional growth delay, as constitutional growth delay would show a proportional delay in both chronological age and bone age. Given these factors, endocrine issues are the most likely cause of his short stature, specifically hypothyroidism, which can present with short stature and delayed bone age without the typical symptoms if the onset was after the newborn period."
