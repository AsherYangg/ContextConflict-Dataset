    "question": "A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5В° C (97.7В° F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. There are numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right-upper sternal border. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 7.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 89 Ојm3\nReticulocyte count 13.3%\nSerum\nSodium 139 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.5 mg/dL\nTest of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "The patient's signs and symptoms point towards chronic blood loss, which is not likely gastrointestinal due to the negative test for occult blood. The most telling symptom is the presence of crusts along the course of her left arm veins, which is indicative of self-induced injection of blood. This, combined with her fear of having cancer (despite no supportive diagnostic evidence), depression, and the high stress from work suggests a psychiatric disorder called factitious disorder imposed on self, formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome. This is a mental illness, in which a person repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental disorder when, in truth, he or she has caused the symptoms. The low hemoglobin and high reticulocyte count (body's response to anemia) support this theory. The murmur heard could be due to increased blood flow velocity due to anemia.",
        "source_2": "This 26-year-old nurse presents with a 2-month history of fatigue, numerous episodes of lower abdominal pain, and a depressed mood. She is also found to be pale with dry mucous membranes and generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Her significant findings include pale conjunctivae, crusts along the veins of her left arm, a systolic ejection murmur, and a markedly low hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL. The crusts along the veins in her arm suggest intravenous drug use. Given her symptoms and presentation, this combination is highly suggestive of a condition called infectious endocarditis. The combination of anemia, possible intravenous drug use, and the presence of a murmur (suggesting valvular disease) strongly point to this diagnosis. The reticulocyte count is high, indicating the body is responding to the anemia by producing more red blood cells. Endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users, often involves the tricuspid valve, which could account for the murmur heard along the right-upper sternal border.",
        "source_3": "Firstly, we need to identify the prior probabilities of conditions that may lead to the symptoms and signs described. There are several findings in this case: low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte count, pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, systolic ejection murmur, generalized weakness of proximal muscles, and a history of stress. Cancer, which the patient is worried about, does not seem to fit the symptoms well as she doesn't display symptoms typically associated with cancer (weight loss, organ-specific symptoms, positive stool occult blood, or findings on abdominal ultrasound).\n\nThe low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dL) and high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggest a state of hemolysis, or rapid red blood cell destruction. The initial, or prior, probability for hemolytic anemia, which fits these lab findings, might be set at 50%.\n\nThe patient's pallor (pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes) further supports the idea of anemia, increasing the posterior probability of hemolytic anemia to around 70%.\n\nThe systolic ejection murmur could be associated with increased blood flow through the heart, which is seen in conditions of high demand, like hemolytic anemia. This raises the probability further to around 80%.\n\nGeneralized weakness and fatigue are common in anemia due to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, increasing the probability to 90%.\n\nFinally, the crusts along the veins of her left arm could indicate intravenous drug use, which is known to be a potential cause of infectious endocarditis. Infectious endocarditis can cause hemolytic anemia due to mechanical destruction of red blood cells on the damaged heart valves, potentially bringing our probability to near certainty, say 95%.\n\nGiven the findings, it seems likely that the patient is dealing with hemolytic anemia, potentially secondary to infectious endocarditis.",
        "source_4": "This patient's presentation of fatigue, pale conjunctivae, low blood pressure, high pulse rate, and low hemoglobin indicate anemia. Her elevated reticulocyte count indicates the body's response to this anemia, attempting to produce more red blood cells. The presence of crusts along her veins suggests repeated intravenous access, which, along with her occupation as a nurse, raises the possibility of self-administered injections and potential illicit substance use. Importantly, generalized weakness of the proximal muscles can indicate muscle damage or inflammation, which could be due to multiple causes, including autoimmune, infectious, or drug-induced myopathy. In the context of this patient's potential access to drugs and her anemia, her presentation might suggest a diagnosis of chronic intravenous drug use leading to drug-induced myopathy and secondary anemia."
