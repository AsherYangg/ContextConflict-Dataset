    "question": "Three days after delivery, a 1100-g (2-lb 7-oz) newborn has a tonic seizure that lasts for 25 seconds. She has become increasingly lethargic over the past 18 hours. She was born at 31 weeks' gestation. Antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis. Apgar scores were 3 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. She appears ill. Her pulse is 123/min, respirations are 50/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. Examination shows a tense anterior fontanelle. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Examination shows slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes. Muscle tone is decreased in all extremities. The lungs are clear to auscultation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The differential for this newborn includes: sepsis, meningitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hypoglycemia, or a metabolic disorder. Sepsis or meningitis could be present due to the history of chorioamnionitis, but the slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes (known as \"sunset\" sign) suggest an increase in intracranial pressure, more commonly seen in IVH. The tense anterior fontanelle also points towards raised intracranial pressure. A metabolic disorder can't be ruled out entirely but the clinical features are more suggestive of an intracranial pathology. Hypoglycemia would typically cause jitteriness or tremors rather than tonic seizures. Given the clinical presentation, gestational age, and history of a low Apgar score, IVH is the most likely diagnosis. IVH is a common complication in premature infants, especially those born before 32 weeks of gestation and with a birth weight of less than 1500 grams.",
        "source_2": "This preterm neonate is presenting with a tonic seizure, lethargy, tense anterior fontanelle, sluggish pupil reactions, irregular respirations, decreased muscle tone in all extremities, and slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes (also known as 'sunsetting sign'). These symptoms together suggest increased intracranial pressure. The antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, which can lead to an intracranial infection in the neonate. The most likely diagnosis is neonatal meningitis.",
        "source_3": "The prior probability of neonatal meningitis is around 0.3% in term infants but increases significantly in premature and low birth weight infants, such as the one described. Therefore, we can start by estimating an initial likelihood of 2%. The neonate is showing signs of illness and lethargy, which can be common in cases of neonatal meningitis, this increases the likelihood to 5%. The baby was born prematurely, at 31 weeks, and the antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, both of which are risk factors for neonatal meningitis, increasing the probability to around 20%. Further, the presence of a tense anterior fontanelle, slow eye movements, decreased muscle tone, and irregular respirations in this context also increases the likelihood of neonatal meningitis to approximately 60%. Given all the clinical findings and history, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal meningitis.",
        "source_4": "This preterm newborn presents with tonic seizures, lethargy, irregular respirations, a tense anterior fontanelle, slow eye movements, and decreased muscle tone in all extremities. The antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, an infection of the amniotic fluid and membranes, which can lead to systemic infection in the neonate. The tense anterior fontanelle suggests increased intracranial pressure. The combination of these findings suggests the neonate has developed meningitis, most likely due to a bacterial infection that ascended from the chorioamnionitis. Bacterial meningitis in neonates can cause the signs of central nervous system dysfunction observed in this patient, including seizures, lethargy, and abnormal eye movements."
