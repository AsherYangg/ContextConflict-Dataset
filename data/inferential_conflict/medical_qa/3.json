    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for erectile dysfunction. He states that for the past month he has been unable to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife despite having appropriate sexual desire. He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. What is the most specific etiology of this patientвЂ™s symptoms?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The prior probability of Leriche Syndrome is around 0.6%. The patient has erectile dysfunction, increasing the probability of Leriche Syndrome to 10%. The patient also has claudication, which further increases the probability to 25%. The absence of lower extremity and femoral pulses increases the probability to 50%. A 40 pack-year smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, all known risk factors for atherosclerosis, increase the probability of Leriche Syndrome to around 75%. Given the information, Leriche Syndrome is the most specific etiology of this patient's symptoms.",
        "source_2": "The patient's erectile dysfunction, lower extremity pain that is relieved by rest (also known as claudication), weak lower extremity and femoral pulses, and a significant smoking history all point to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is a common complication of atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the arteries, reducing blood flow to the limbs. Reduced arterial blood flow can lead to claudication and erectile dysfunction, as the penis also relies on adequate blood flow to achieve an erection. The risk of PAD is significantly increased in patients with a history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, as in this patient. Therefore, the most specific etiology of this patient's symptoms is likely atherosclerosis leading to peripheral arterial disease.",
        "source_3": "The patient has symptoms of erectile dysfunction and claudication, which is pain in the lower extremities (buttock and hip in this case) during exertion that's relieved by rest. This symptomatology is typically caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a condition characterized by atherosclerotic blockages in the arteries supplying the legs. The patient's risk factors for PAD, including his advanced age, history of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, make this condition likely. Furthermore, weak lower extremity and femoral pulses on physical examination further support this diagnosis. Erectile dysfunction in this case could be due to insufficient blood supply to the penis, as the internal pudendal arteries that supply the penis could also be affected by atherosclerosis."
