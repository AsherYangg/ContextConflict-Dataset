    "question": "A 55-year-old male bodybuilder presents to the emergency department with weakness of his right arm. The patient states he has experienced these symptoms for a few weeks; however, today his hand felt so weak he dropped his cup of tea. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes. He drinks 2-7 alcoholic drinks per day and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per day since he was 25. The patient admits to using anabolic steroids. He has lost 17 pounds since he last came to the emergency department 1 month ago. His temperature is 99.5В°F (37.5В°C), blood pressure is 177/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals decreased sensation in the right arm and 2/5 strength in the right arm and 5/5 strength in in the left arm. The patient states that he is experiencing a dull aching and burning pain in his right arm during the exam. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "This patient's presentation is indicative of a peripheral neuropathy, specifically mononeuropathy given the isolated involvement of the right arm. His history of diabetes could suggest diabetic neuropathy, which typically presents as a polyneuropathy affecting the longest nerves first (i.e., stocking-and-glove distribution), not a mononeuropathy. The patient's significant smoking history, hypertension, and use of anabolic steroids point towards a possible vascular cause such as mononeuritis multiplex. However, the significant weight loss and his history of smoking heavily favor a malignancy. The isolated weakness and sensory loss in one arm is typical of a Pancoast tumor, a type of lung cancer that develops at the lung's apex and invades the brachial plexus, leading to a clinical syndrome of shoulder and arm pain and weakness.",
        "source_2": "This patient has a few risk factors for peripheral neuropathy, including chronic alcohol use, diabetes, and potential nutritional deficiencies related to weight loss. The presented symptoms suggest a mononeuropathy rather than a polyneuropathy, as only the right arm is affected. The history of anabolic steroid use, weight lifting, and recent weight loss also raise concern for a potential compressive neuropathy, such as a brachial plexopathy. Compressive or traumatic brachial plexopathies can cause weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the affected limb. In this case, the patient's high blood pressure may suggest anabolic steroid abuse is ongoing, which can cause nerve damage due to hypertrophy of the surrounding musculature compressing the nerves. The burning, aching pain, and progressive weakness in the right arm are most consistent with brachial plexopathy.",
        "source_3": "The differential for this patient includes: peripheral neuropathy, stroke, spinal cord compression, musculoskeletal injury, and peripheral vascular disease. Given his past medical history of diabetes, peripheral neuropathy is a possible cause; however, the acute and localized nature of the symptoms is more suggestive of focal neurological damage than a systemic disease. His use of anabolic steroids and significant weight loss raises suspicion of a malignancy which could lead to spinal cord compression. The hypertension and smoking history could predispose him to a stroke, but weakness is isolated to the right arm which makes this less likely. The dull aching and burning pain, along with the weakness and decreased sensation in the right arm, points to a potential nerve compression or nerve damage issue. Considering his history of anabolic steroid use, bodybuilding, and recent weight loss, one possibility is that he has a tumor causing nerve compression. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a brachial plexus injury possibly due to a tumor (likely lung cancer given his significant smoking history).",
        "source_4": "This patient's symptoms point towards a neurological condition. The prior probability of a peripheral neuropathy, considering the patient's age, diabetic status, and alcohol use is around 10%. The presence of unilateral weakness and numbness increases the likelihood to 20%.\n\nHowever, in the context of a bodybuilder who admits to anabolic steroid use, the symptoms could also indicate a nerve compression syndrome like a brachial plexopathy, which has a prior probability of around 5%. The ongoing weakness of the right arm, especially with this history, would increase this probability to around 20%.\n\nThere is also a potential for a central nervous system issue, such as a stroke. Given the patient's age, smoking history, diabetes, and hypertension, the prior probability of a stroke is around 15%. The focal neurological symptoms (weakness and numbness in the right arm) increases this probability to around 25%.\n\nGiven these considerations, and the fact that the strength difference is so marked between the right and left arm, and there is a sensory deficit along with pain, a brachial plexopathy is likely. This could be due to nerve compression or injury related to the bodybuilder's training or steroid use."
