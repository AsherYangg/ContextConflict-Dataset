    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police at 2:00 AM. They picked him up from a local nightclub, where he was yelling and threatening to fight the staff. A review of his medical record is unremarkable. At the hospital, his behavior continues to be agitated and bizarre. His temperature is 37.0В°C (98.6В°F), the blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg, the heart rate is 120/min, the respiratory rate is 18/min, and the oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable for agitation, but otherwise, he appears healthy. His thin nasal mucosa oozes blood and his pupils are 2mm, equal, and reactive to light. His speech is pressured and bizarre. He insists the hospital should let him go because вЂњI am in the FBIвЂќ. Urine toxicology is sent to the laboratory for analysis. What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",

        "source_1": "This 23-year-old male patient is presenting with symptoms including agitation, bizarre behavior, pressured and unusual speech, and a raised blood pressure and heart rate. These symptoms can be associated with drug use, particularly the use of stimulants. His physical exam reveals bloody nasal mucosa, a common symptom of snorting drugs, and small pupils which are commonly seen with opioid use, but can also occur with stimulant use if it's intense enough. However, opioids typically lead to sedation rather than agitation, and the bizarre and agitated behavior with the high blood pressure and heart rate suggests more towards stimulant use such as cocaine or amphetamines. The fact that he was picked up from a nightclub further suggests the possibility of recreational drug use.",
        "source_2": "This patient's symptoms include agitation, bizarre behavior, nasal bleeding (suggestive of possible insufflation of drugs), pressured and bizarre speech, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. The differential diagnosis here includes substance intoxication (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens), acute psychosis, mania, and delirium due to a medical condition. The context provided (picked up from a nightclub), the presence of physical signs suggesting sympathomimetic toxicity (hypertension, tachycardia), and the thin bleeding nasal mucosa suggesting possible insufflation make substance intoxication most likely. The bizarre, pressured speech, and delusions could suggest a primary psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but these conditions would not account for the nasal bleeding or the significantly elevated vital signs. Acute medical conditions such as thyroid storm or pheochromocytoma could potentially produce similar symptoms but would be less likely in a young, otherwise healthy individual. Moreover, the history does not suggest a recent start of medications that could induce such a state (e.g., steroids, anticholinergics). Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is substance abuse, particularly of a stimulant like cocaine or amphetamines."
