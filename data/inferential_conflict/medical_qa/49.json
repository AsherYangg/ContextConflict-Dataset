    "question": "A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 Ојg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. What is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",

        "source_1": "The differential diagnosis for a patient with an enlarged thyroid includes Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, and subacute thyroiditis. Considering her symptoms of difficulty in swallowing due to an enlargement in the anterior neck, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and feeling extremely cold, it suggests hypothyroidism. The lab results showing a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH level also support the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\n\nGraves' disease usually presents with hyperthyroidism, so it's less likely. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can present with a firm thyroid, but it's usually not painful. Thyroid nodules might cause enlargement but usually don't cause hypothyroidism. Thyroid cancer might present with a hard thyroid gland but doesn't usually present with hypothyroidism and is usually painless. Subacute thyroiditis can present with a painful thyroid but usually has a phase of hyperthyroidism.\n\nThis patientХs thyroid is not only enlarged but also stony hard, tender and asymmetrical with pain during swallowing, which are characteristic of Riedel's thyroiditis. This is a rare form of chronic thyroiditis characterized by the replacement of thyroid tissue with dense fibrosis that invades adjacent structures. Additionally, the low radioactive iodine uptake seen in radionuclide thyroid scanning is also consistent with Riedel's thyroiditis, as the fibrotic thyroid gland is not capable of taking up iodine efficiently.",
        "source_2": "This 48-year-old female is presenting with an enlargement of her anterior neck, difficulty swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and cold intolerance. Her laboratory studies show a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH level, which are indicative of hypothyroidism. The stony-hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland along with pain associated with swallowing, and the finding of low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning is characteristic of thyroiditis, and in this clinical setting, it is suggestive of de Quervain's thyroiditis (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis). De Quervain's thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland which is often preceded by a viral infection and presents with a painful, tender thyroid gland.",
        "source_3": "The prior probability of the patient having thyroiditis is 10%. Considering her symptoms of neck enlargement and difficulty swallowing, the posterior probability increases to 25%. With the addition of constipation, fatigue, and increased menstrual bleeding which are symptoms of hypothyroidism, the probability increases to 50%. The thyroid examination revealing a stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid is consistent with thyroiditis and this finding increases the probability further to 70%. The laboratory studies showing a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH are indicative of hypothyroidism, which is a feature of thyroiditis, raising the probability to 85%. The radionuclide thyroid scanning indicating low radioactive iodine uptake is consistent with thyroiditis, and this increases the probability further to over 90%. Given the combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is thyroiditis, specifically De Quervain's thyroiditis which presents with a painful and tender thyroid.",
        "source_4": "This 48-year-old female patient is presenting with an enlargement of her anterior neck, difficulty swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and cold intolerance. The lab results show a decreased serum T4 level and an elevated TSH level. The patient's presentation with cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue, and heavy menstrual bleeding, along with the lab findings, are indicative of hypothyroidism. However, the stony-hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland coupled with pain associated with swallowing and low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning is suggestive of thyroiditis, likely subacute thyroiditis, or De Quervain's thyroiditis. In De Quervain's thyroiditis, there is often pain in the anterior neck and thyroid tenderness. The thyroid gland may also be asymmetrically enlarged. The initial phase of De Quervain's thyroiditis can cause the release of thyroid hormones resulting in transient hyperthyroidism which is followed by hypothyroidism which this patient is likely in due to her symptoms and lab values. The low radioactive iodine uptake is consistent with the destruction of thyroid follicles in De Quervain's thyroiditis."
