    "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of progressive difficulty walking during the past 3 months. He has not been able to walk without assistance for the past month and has started to use a wheelchair. He also reports having urinary incontinence for 1 year. His wife says that he has begun to slur his words and has become very difficult to understand. His temperature is 37.0В°C (98.6В°F), pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 16/min. His blood pressure is 130/80mm Hg while sitting and 110/65mm Hg when standing. He is oriented to person and place but not to time. Neurological examination shows a mild tremor in his right hand and rigidity in his upper and lower extremities. He is unable to perform repetitive rotary forearm movements. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The differential diagnosis for this patient can include Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, or a stroke. The symptoms of slurred speech, difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, hand tremor, and rigidity in upper and lower extremities are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nParkinson's disease is usually characterized by rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. However, the progression of this disease is usually slow and it does not commonly cause urinary incontinence in the early stages.\n\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA), on the other hand, often presents with parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor) along with autonomic dysfunction (like urinary incontinence) and cerebellar signs, making this a more likely diagnosis given the symptomatology. Additionally, the rapid progression over 3 months is more consistent with MSA than Parkinson's, which tends to progress more slowly.\n\nProgressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are less likely, given the absence of distinctive features like vertical gaze palsy in the former, and asymmetric limb apraxia and dystonia in the latter.\n\nWhile a stroke could explain some of these symptoms, the slow and progressive onset makes this less likely.",
        "source_2": "This patient's difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, and decline in speech clarity are suggestive of a syndrome called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The classic clinical triad of NPH is gait disturbances, dementia, and urinary incontinence, often in that order. His neurologic examination shows parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia as shown by his inability to perform rapid alternating movements, and a mild tremor), which can also be associated with NPH. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension can be seen in NPH due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Even though the syndrome is called \"normal pressure,\" the intracranial pressure can fluctuate and it's the \"normal\" pressure that often leads to a delay in diagnosis as a typical lumbar puncture may not reveal elevated pressure.",
        "source_3": "The prior probability of Parkinson's disease in this patient's age group is around 1%. The presence of rigidity and a tremor in the patient's extremities increases the likelihood of Parkinson's disease to about 30%. The difficulty with walking and the need for a wheelchair further increases the likelihood to about 60%. The presence of urinary incontinence and slurred speech, which can both be seen in advanced Parkinson's disease, increases the probability to 75%. His difficulty with performing repetitive rotary forearm movements, which suggests bradykinesia, another cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease, further increases the probability to about 85%. In addition, the patient's postural hypotension can be a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, further supporting the diagnosis. Therefore, based on the Bayesian approach, this patient most likely has Parkinson's disease."
