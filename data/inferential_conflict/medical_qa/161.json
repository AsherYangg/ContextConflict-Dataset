    "question": "A 70-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an 8-week history of blood in his stool. Two months ago, he had an episode of bronchitis and was treated with amoxicillin. Since then, he has noticed blood in his stool and on the toilet paper occasionally. The patient has had intermittent constipation for the past 5 years. Six months ago, he had severe left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotic therapy. He underwent a colonoscopy 3 years ago, which did not show any evidence of malignancy. He takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years, but quit smoking 10 years ago. He drinks one glass of red wine every night. He appears pale. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36В°C (96.8В°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Digital rectal examination shows no masses. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 76 Ојm3\nRed cell distribution width 17% (N = 13вЂ“15)\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "This patient presents with signs of chronic blood loss as shown by the pale conjunctivae, positive stool for occult blood, and a low hemoglobin value indicating anemia. His low Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) suggests microcytic anemia which is often due to iron deficiency anemia, typically caused by chronic blood loss. His Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is high, which is often seen in iron deficiency anemia as the body tries to produce new red blood cells of varying sizes in response to a low iron supply. Given his history of occasional blood in the stool, it seems probable that the patient has been losing blood chronically from the gastrointestinal tract. The history of severe left lower quadrant pain and fever six months ago that resolved with antibiotic therapy suggests that he might have had diverticulitis. Diverticulosis (which can cause diverticulitis) is a common cause of painless rectal bleeding in older adults and can result in iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss.",
        "source_2": "The patient in question is a 70-year-old male who has a history of blood in his stool for 8 weeks. The patient has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption, although these habits have been discontinued for some time. His history also includes an episode of bronchitis and severe left lower quadrant pain and fever, both of which were treated with antibiotics.\n\nThe most relevant finding in his examination is the paleness of his conjunctiva and positive test for occult blood in his stool. These findings, combined with his low hemoglobin level, indicate that he is anemic. The type of anemia is suggested by his mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which is low (76 Ојm3, normal range is 80-96 Ојm3), indicating a microcytic anemia. In combination with the red cell distribution width (RDW) which is elevated (17% when the normal range is 13-15%), this points towards an anemia of chronic disease (also known as anemia of inflammation) or iron deficiency anemia.\n\nHowever, iron deficiency anemia is typically associated with gastrointestinal blood loss in men and post-menopausal women. This man has noticed blood in his stool and on the toilet paper occasionally, which also points towards iron deficiency anemia.\n\nTherefore, considering the patient's age, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and history of visible and occult gastrointestinal bleeding, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia, likely secondary to a gastrointestinal source of blood loss (which could be due to several reasons such as a malignancy, angiodysplasia, hemorrhoids, etc).",
        "source_3": "The prior probability of iron deficiency anemia given the symptoms and test results is 10%. The patient's long history of smoking and drinking (which can both cause GI bleeding) increases the posterior probability of iron deficiency anemia to 30%. The patient also has constipation and positive occult blood in stool, raising the probability to 60%. His low hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume as well as the high red cell distribution width increase the probability to 90%. Given these features, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia."
