    "question": "A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was вЂњpretty coldвЂќ in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32В°C (89.6В°F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. What drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",

        "source_1": "Step 1: The prior probability of a medication causing the altered mental status and hypothermia is high in this patient given his history of multiple medical conditions requiring medications.\n\nStep 2: Among his medications, thyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and antihypertensives are common culprits of altered mental status. The fact that the patient was started on a new medication 10 days ago increases the posterior probability of that medication being the cause.\n\nStep 3: The patient has hypothyroidism, and medications used for its management usually do not cause hypothermia or altered mental status, so the likelihood of thyroid medication being the cause decreases.\n\nStep 4: His presentation with hypothermia, bradycardia, lethargy, and altered mental status is classic for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can be caused by antipsychotic medications. Since the patient has schizoaffective disorder and was started on a new medication recently, the probability of an antipsychotic medication causing these symptoms increases.\n\nStep 5: Given the constellation of symptoms and the likelihood of a new medication being started, the probability of an antipsychotic medication causing NMS, leading to this presentation, becomes very high.",
        "source_2": "The patient in this case is presenting with hypothermia, bradycardia (slow heart rate), respiratory depression, weakness in the lower extremities, and altered mental status. The fact that his apartment was cold is a clue, but his symptoms are too severe to be explained solely by the environmental temperature. His presentation is indicative of severe hypothyroidism, which could be secondary to the use of a medication that affects his thyroid function. Of the conditions he has, it is pertinent to focus on hypothyroidism as a condition that can be affected significantly by medications. A drug that can cause hypothyroidism and can explain this patient's presentation is lithium. Lithium is often used to treat schizoaffective disorder, and can cause hypothyroidism by inhibiting thyroid hormone release. Hypothyroidism can cause decreased metabolic activity, leading to hypothermia, bradycardia, respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and altered mental status, all of which are present in this patient. The addition of a new drug 10 days ago and the presentation of these symptoms highly suggest the involvement of the new drug in causing severe hypothyroidism.",
        "source_3": "The patient in this scenario has several key findings such as altered mental status, hypothermia (32ЎC or 89.6ЎF), bradycardia (pulse 54/min), bradypnea (respirations 8/min), weakness in lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes, and dilated pupils poorly reactive to light. One of the critical elements in the history is that the patient has hypothyroidism and was started on a new drug ten days ago.\n\nThe combination of hypothermia, bradycardia, altered mental status, and decreased deep tendon reflexes is indicative of severe hypothyroidism, termed myxedema coma. It is crucial to consider that certain drugs can precipitate myxedema coma in patients with hypothyroidism. Of the medications that this patient might be taking for his other conditions (schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), the most likely culprit is a medication that affects mental status and could exacerbate hypothyroidism, such as lithium. Lithium is used to treat mood disorders and can inhibit thyroid hormone release, potentially leading to or exacerbating hypothyroidism and causing myxedema coma, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.",
        "source_4": "The patient presents with altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia (32ЎC or 89.6ЎF), bradycardia (pulse 54/min), respiratory depression (respirations 8/min), weakness in lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes, and mydriasis (dilated pupils poorly reactive to light). The clinical picture is indicative of a central nervous system depression. Since the patient has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and has been started on a new drug 10 days ago, it is imperative to consider the role of the medication in the development of these symptoms. Among medications used for schizoaffective disorder, antipsychotics are known to have a potential side effect of neuroleptic malignant syndrome which can cause altered mental status and lead to dysregulation of temperature, but that usually presents with hyperthermia and not hypothermia. However, medications such as sedative-hypnotics, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates, could be responsible for CNS depression. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing despite being hypothermic (paradoxical undressing) is a classic symptom of severe hypothermia which can be aggravated by sedatives. It is likely that the new medication is a sedative or hypnotic, causing CNS and respiratory depression leading to the clinical presentation."
