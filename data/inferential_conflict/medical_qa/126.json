    "question": "A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because of burning pain in his neck and arms for a year. He has also had paresthesias in his hands during this period. He has had increasing weakness in both hands during the past 3 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. He was involved in a motor vehicle collision 3 years ago. Current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has had 7 sexual partners in his lifetime; he uses condoms inconsistently. He is oriented to time, place, and person. Vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination of the upper extremities shows decreased muscle strength, absent reflexes, and decreased hand grip with fasciculations bilaterally. Sensation to temperature and pain is absent over the chest and bilateral upper arms. Vibration and joint position sensations are present in the upper limbs. Cranial nerve examination shows no focal findings. Examination of the lower extremities show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The patient's symptoms - burning pain in the neck and arms, paresthesias, weakness, and absent reflexes in the upper extremities, along with sensory changes - suggest a problem with the cervical spinal cord. More specifically, these findings suggest a condition called syringomyelia, which is a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord, often due to trauma (like the car accident the patient had 3 years ago). This cyst can expand and elongate over time, damaging the spinal cord and leading to the symptoms seen in this patient. Syringomyelia typically first affects the nerves that control pain and temperature sensation, which explains the loss of these senses over the chest and upper arms. It also affects motor function leading to weakness, fasciculations, and absent reflexes.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a type of motor neuron disease, is relatively low, approximately 0.02%. However, this patient has fasciculations and muscle weakness which increases the probability of ALS to approximately 10%. Further, he also exhibits decreased hand grip strength which increases the probability to 30%. Moreover, decreased reflexes are commonly seen in ALS patients, raising the probability to 60%. Finally, sensory findings of absent temperature and pain sensation over the chest and bilateral upper arms, while not a primary symptom of ALS, may be seen in the disease due to the loss of muscle control and coordination, further raising the probability to about 70%. Given the constellation of these symptoms and absence of other classic signs and symptoms of alternative diagnoses, this patient most likely has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.",
        "source_3": "The symptoms presented by this patient are indicative of a chronic and progressive neurological disorder. Given the combination of sensory (paresthesias, loss of pain and temperature sensation) and motor (weakness, decreased hand grip, fasciculations) abnormalities confined to upper extremities, the condition likely involves a part of the spinal cord. Specifically, these symptoms are suggestive of a cervical spinal cord disorder.\n\nIn this context, the history of a motor vehicle collision 3 years ago is of particular importance. The patient's symptoms could be a delayed consequence of this accident if it involved any degree of trauma to the cervical spine or spinal cord. The accident could have caused a chronic degenerative condition such as cervical spondylosis, where pressure is placed on the spinal cord and nerves due to wear and tear or damage to the discs or vertebrae of the cervical spine. The fact that the symptoms have progressively worsened over the past year is consistent with this possibility."
