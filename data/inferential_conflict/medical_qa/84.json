    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and shortness of breath with moderate exertion for the past 2 months. Over the past 10 days, he has had low-grade fevers and night sweats. He has no history of serious illness except for a bicuspid aortic valve diagnosed 5 years ago. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drinks 3вЂ“5 beers on social occasions. He does not use illicit drugs. The patient takes no medications. He appears weak. His temperature is 37.7В°C (99.9В°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 128/64 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard best at the right sternal border and second intercostal space. There are several hemorrhages underneath his fingernails on both hands and multiple tender, red nodules on his fingers. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "This patient presents with subacute symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, low-grade fevers, and night sweats. This, coupled with the presence of hemorrhages underneath his fingernails (splinter hemorrhages), and tender, red nodules on his fingers (Osler's nodes) indicates infective endocarditis. The presence of a pre-existing bicuspid aortic valve would predispose him to this condition. The most common causal organisms of infective endocarditis are viridans group streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, but in a person with a history of congenital heart disease, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, viridans group streptococci are the most common.",
        "source_2": "This patient's symptoms of fever, night sweats, fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, combined with the physical findings of a systolic murmur (suggestive of his known bicuspid aortic valve) and Janeway lesions (the hemorrhages underneath his fingernails) and Osler's nodes (the tender, red nodules on his fingers) are all highly suggestive of infective endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart, most often affecting the heart valves. The most common causal organisms of infective endocarditis vary, but the most common in the general population is Staphylococcus aureus, especially in a patient without a history of intravenous drug use.",
        "source_3": "This patient's presentation strongly suggests infective endocarditis. Given the fact that he has a bicuspid aortic valve, a well-known predisposing cardiac condition, the likelihood of infective endocarditis increases significantly.\n\nThe prior probability of Staphylococcus aureus causing endocarditis might be 25% in the general population. Given that he has a predisposing cardiac condition (bicuspid aortic valve), this increases the posterior probability to around 35%. The fact that he is presenting with both systemic signs of infection (fatigue, fevers, and night sweats) and local signs of vascular phenomenon (hemorrhages under his fingernails, known as splinter hemorrhages, and tender, red nodules on his fingers, known as Osler's nodes) increases the probability of Staphylococcus aureus as the causative organism to around 50%.\n\nThis patient has no history of intravenous drug use, which would make Staphylococcus aureus more likely, but he does have a history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol can be a risk factor for endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans, but given the severity of the symptoms and the presence of systemic signs, it's more likely to be Staphylococcus aureus, especially given that this bacteria tends to be more virulent.\n\nThus, the overall probability that the causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus is above 50%."
