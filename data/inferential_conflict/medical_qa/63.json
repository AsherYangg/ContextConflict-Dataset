    "question": "A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "This patient presents with painless antepartum bleeding, which suggests a disorder of the placenta. However, the ultrasound finding of a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall rules out placenta previa, which is typically associated with painless bleeding and a placenta that at least partially covers the cervical os. Cervical trauma or infection could also cause bleeding, but these are usually associated with a painful or purulent discharge, respectively, and neither seems likely in this case given her symptoms and history. In this case, the bruised and tender cervix along with the recent history of resumed sexual activity suggest that her symptoms are most likely due to cervical trauma from intercourse.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with antepartum bleeding (vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks' gestation) but no pain, tenderness, or signs of placental abruption (such as an uncomfortable or tender abdomen). Also, the fetus is healthy as evidenced by the reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Importantly, ultrasound does not reveal a placenta previa (placenta covering the cervical os). However, she has a history of a previous cesarean section, which can cause the placenta to implant abnormally in subsequent pregnancies, often at the site of the previous scar, known as placenta accreta, increta, or percreta, but these conditions usually cause significant bleeding, which is not evident in this case.\n\nThe patient resumed sexual activity recently after avoiding it during her early pregnancy, and the cervix is described as tender and bruised with blood traces. This points to a more benign cause of antepartum bleeding, known as cervical ectropion (or cervical erosion), which is a condition in which the inner lining of the cervix protrudes outwards, making it more prone to trauma and bleeding, especially following sexual intercourse."
