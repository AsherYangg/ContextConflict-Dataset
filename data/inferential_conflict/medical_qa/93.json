    "question": "A 17-year-old boy comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of pain in his left wrist. That morning the pain increased and he started to have chills and malaise. Last week he had self-resolving left knee pain. He is otherwise healthy and has not had any trauma to the wrist. He recently returned from a camping trip to Minnesota. He is sexually active with one female partner, who uses a diaphragm for contraception. His temperature is 37.7В°C (99.9В°F). Examination shows several painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the dorsum of both wrists and hands; two lesions are present on the left palm. There is swelling and erythema of the left wrist with severe tenderness to palpation and passive movement. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The differential for this patient includes: reactive arthritis, gout, Lyme disease, bacterial or viral infection, and sexually transmitted infections such as gonococcal arthritis. The camping trip to Minnesota, a known endemic area, raises suspicion for Lyme disease, but he lacks a classic erythema migrans rash. The appearance of vesiculopustular lesions, however, along with wrist pain and recent sexual activity with a single partner, suggests gonococcal arthritis, which often manifests with a triad of dermatitis, tenosynovitis, and migratory polyarthralgia. Gonococcal arthritis should be suspected in sexually active young adults with monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis. This patient most likely has gonococcal arthritis.",
        "source_2": "The patient's history of a camping trip in Minnesota, a region where Lyme disease is prevalent, along with the symptoms of migrating joint pain, suggests that he might be suffering from Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which can cause a variety of symptoms including fever, chills, malaise, and arthritis. Although the classic \"bull's eye\" rash (erythema migrans) is not mentioned, it only appears in approximately 70-80% of infected individuals and its absence does not rule out the disease. The violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on his hands and wrists could suggest a concomitant infection with a sexually transmitted disease such as secondary syphilis, however, the joint pain and history of exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area make this less likely.",
        "source_3": "In this scenario, we can approach the Bayesian inference analysis in a similar fashion. We can start by setting a prior probability of Lyme disease, given the symptoms and circumstances that we are presented with. Let's set it at 10% initially because the symptoms are relatively non-specific.\n\nHowever, there are clues in the description that would significantly increase the posterior probability. First, the patient was camping in Minnesota, which is a known endemic area for Lyme disease. This increases the probability to 30%.\n\nSecond, the patient presents with a migrating musculoskeletal pain (left knee pain followed by left wrist pain), which is a common presentation of Lyme disease. This further increases the probability to 50%.\n\nThird, the presence of painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the dorsum of both wrists and hands could be suggestive of erythema migrans, a common sign of Lyme disease. This bumps the probability up to 70%.\n\nFinally, his constitutional symptoms, including fever and malaise, are consistent with early disseminated Lyme disease, bringing the final posterior probability up to 80%. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient is suffering from Lyme disease.",
        "source_4": "This patient's history of travel to Minnesota, a state known to be endemic for ticks, combined with his recent camping trip, are suggestive of exposure to ticks. The painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on his hands and wrists may represent erythema migrans, a characteristic rash associated with Lyme disease. Additionally, his migratory joint pain (initially in the knee, now in the wrist) is another classic symptom of Lyme disease. Lastly, his generalized symptoms of malaise and chills can be seen in early disseminated Lyme disease."
