    "question": "A 51-year-old woman presents to your office with 2 weeks of fatigue and generalized weakness. She has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and started on disease-modifying therapy. She states she has felt less able to do things she enjoys and feels guilty she can't play sports with her children. Review of systems is notable for the patient occasionally seeing a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 12 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 7,700/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 207,000/mm^3\nMCV: 110 fL\n\nWhat is the most likely etiology of this patient's fatigue?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The differential for this patient includes anemia, depression, hypothyroidism, diabetes-related fatigue, and medication side effect. The patient's hemoglobin is 12 g/dL, which is low normal and does not typically cause symptoms unless there is an acute drop. Her hematocrit is 36%, again low normal but not necessarily indicative of symptomatic anemia. However, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 110 fL, indicating macrocytosis, which can be due to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, or certain medications (like hydroxyurea or antiretroviral therapy). Given the patient's presentation, her macrocytic anemia could be attributed to a deficiency of B12 or folate, especially if her rheumatoid arthritis therapy includes methotrexate, which can cause folate deficiency.\n\nThis patient's history of occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper might suggest hemorrhoidal or rectal bleeding, but the macrocytic anemia is not consistent with an iron deficiency anemia that might be expected with gastrointestinal blood loss. Finally, the fatigue and decreased enjoyment in activities could potentially indicate depression, a common co-morbidity in patients with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. However, this is less likely given the laboratory findings. The best explanation for the fatigue given the patient's history and labs is likely B12 or folate deficiency causing macrocytic anemia.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with fatigue, generalized weakness, and notable for occasional bright red blood when she wipes, which may suggest bleeding. The laboratory findings show a microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume or MCV of 110 fL is above the normal range of 80-100 fL), which can result from a variety of causes including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, and alcoholism. However, given her symptoms and the history of seeing bright red blood on the toilet paper, the most likely cause for her fatigue is anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to iron deficiency anemia over time, but when the iron stores are sufficiently depleted, the bone marrow produces larger and fewer red blood cells leading to a macrocytic (high MCV) picture."
