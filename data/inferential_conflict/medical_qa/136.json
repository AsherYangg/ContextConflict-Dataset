    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents to the physician with fever, cough, weakness, night sweats, and poor appetite for the past 6 months. Medical records suggest that he has lost 7.5 kg (16.5 lb) of weight during this period. There is no history of breathlessness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, palpitations, chest pain, or symptoms related to digestion. He was released from prison 9 months ago after serving a 2-year sentence. His temperature is 38.1В°C (100.6В°F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy, and auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields bilaterally. On direct ophthalmoscopy, three discrete, yellow-colored, 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm lesions with indistinct borders are seen in the posterior pole. A chest X-ray is shown in the image. Tuberculin skin test with purified protein derivative is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "This patient presents with fever, cough, night sweats, and weight loss, which are common symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the negative tuberculin skin test, which has a high false-negative rate in patients with tuberculosis, as well as the history of prison, does not entirely support this diagnosis. He also has hepatomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy, which may suggest a systemic disease like lymphoma, but the absence of the usual B symptoms (night sweats, fever, weight loss) does not strongly support this diagnosis.\n\nThe presence of yellow-colored lesions with indistinct borders in the retina is strongly suggestive of choroidal tubercles, which are a hallmark of disseminated tuberculosis. Choroidal tubercles are the most common ocular manifestation of tuberculosis and are usually multiple and bilateral. These findings, along with his history of prison, which increases his risk for tuberculosis, lead to a likely diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. A chest x-ray is not provided in the question stem, but it is mentioned. In cases of disseminated tuberculosis, the chest x-ray often shows miliary pattern (multiple tiny nodules throughout the lung fields).",
        "source_2": "The patient's presentation includes several clues that can be analyzed using Bayesian inference.\n\nThe prior probability for tuberculosis in the general population might be relatively low (let's say 5%), but this probability changes with the given evidence:\n\nWeight loss, night sweats, and fever are all symptoms of tuberculosis. Given these symptoms, the probability of tuberculosis might increase to 15%.\n\nThe patient was recently in prison, where TB is more prevalent due to crowded living conditions. This might increase the probability of tuberculosis to 25%.\n\nAuscultation reveals crackles in the lung fields, which can indicate an infectious process like tuberculosis, increasing the likelihood to 35%.\n\nHowever, the presence of hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and discrete yellow-colored lesions in the eye are not typical for tuberculosis, and a negative tuberculin skin test further decreases the likelihood of tuberculosis, dropping the probability back to 10%.\n\nThese symptoms and signs are, however, indicative of a disseminated infection, possibly fungal. The most common systemic fungal infection that would cause this presentation, especially in the context of incarceration where conditions may be suboptimal, is histoplasmosis.\n\nThe presence of symptoms like cough and fever (indicative of a respiratory tract infection), hepatomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy (suggesting a systemic infection), the presence of lesions in the eye (histoplasma can cause ocular disease), and his incarceration history (histoplasma is often found in soil and in bird or bat droppings, which could be encountered in less hygienic environments) increase the probability of histoplasmosis.\n\nTherefore, while TB was initially a consideration, the constellation of symptoms, history, and physical exam findings lead us to a more likely diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.",
        "source_3": "This patient has a range of symptoms including fever, cough, weakness, night sweats, weight loss, and poor appetite that have persisted over a period of six months, which are systemic and suggestive of a chronic disease. His past history of incarceration and the findings of hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields could be suggestive of a number of diseases, including tuberculosis or fungal infection. However, a negative tuberculin skin test makes tuberculosis less likely. The unique feature that helps narrow the diagnosis is the presence of yellowish lesions in the posterior pole of the eyes, which suggests some type of systemic disease with ocular involvement. A common condition that fits this description is disseminated sarcoidosis, a multisystem inflammatory disease which commonly involves the lungs, lymph nodes, and eyes and can present with weight loss, night sweats and fever. The disease frequently results in bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy which could cause diffuse crackles in lungs, and might be seen in the chest X-ray (even though the image is not provided here).",
        "source_4": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer, and disseminated fungal infection.\n\nTuberculosis, while plausible given his history of imprisonment, would typically present with positive tuberculin skin test (TST), which is not the case in this patient. Furthermore, the presence of diffuse crackles and hepatomegaly is atypical for tuberculosis.\n\nSarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease, which can present with non-specific systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy. However, the presence of hepatomegaly is less commonly seen in sarcoidosis and the skin test usually comes out as negative.\n\nNTM infection is less likely as they usually present in patients with underlying lung diseases or in immunocompromised individuals, neither of which is the case for this patient.\n\nMetastatic cancer could also present with such findings but the yellowish lesions in the eye are not typical for metastasis and are more commonly seen in fungal infections.\n\nDisseminated fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis, can present with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fever, and hepatomegaly. Generalized lymphadenopathy is also common. Furthermore, eye involvement, which can present as choroidal lesions as described, is a known manifestation of disseminated fungal infections. Given his clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a disseminated fungal infection."
