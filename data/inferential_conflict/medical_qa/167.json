    "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 1 hour after her husband saw her faint shortly after getting out of bed from a nap. She regained consciousness within 30 seconds and was fully alert and oriented. She has had 2 similar episodes in the last 5 years, once while standing in line at the grocery store and once when getting out of bed in the morning. 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were unremarkable at her last hospitalization 1 year ago. She has hypertension, depression, and asthma. Current medications include verapamil, nortriptyline, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. Her temperature is 37В°C (98.4В°F), pulse is 74/min and regular, respirations are 14/min, blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg when supine and 95/60 mm Hg while standing. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference range. Bedside cardiac monitoring shows rare premature ventricular contractions and T-wave inversions in lead III. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "source_1": "The history provided by this 67-year-old woman points towards a possible diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. Given the context, her symptoms (fainting shortly after getting up) and her decrease in blood pressure (from 114/72 mm Hg when supine to 95/60 mm Hg while standing) are consistent with this condition.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension can occur for a variety of reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins, and certain neurological disorders. The use of certain medications can also contribute to the condition. In this particular case, the patient's use of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, could be contributing to her symptoms. Calcium channel blockers can lower the blood pressure, which, especially in combination with the transition from a supine to a standing position, may be enough to cause a syncopal episode.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of neurally mediated syncope (also known as vasovagal syncope) is around 5% in the general population. However, in this patient's case, we have to consider multiple factors. Her history of similar fainting episodes, particularly in situations like standing up from a lying position, increases the posterior probability to about 30%. These situations are known to provoke neurally mediated syncope due to a transient decrease in cerebral perfusion.\n\nThe fact that she regained consciousness rapidly, was fully alert and oriented, and had no neurological deficits further raises the probability of neurally mediated syncope to about 50%. These features are typical of this condition.\n\nHer blood pressure shows a significant drop upon standing, which is a common finding in neurally mediated syncope, increasing the likelihood to about 60%. Furthermore, her 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were unremarkable, which excludes many cardiac causes of syncope and further strengthens the likelihood of neurally mediated syncope to around 80%.\n\nHer medications, specifically verapamil (a calcium channel blocker), may predispose her to episodes of syncope, further increasing the likelihood to around 90%. Finally, the absence of other typical causes of syncope in her blood work and physical examination further reinforces the likelihood of neurally mediated syncope."
