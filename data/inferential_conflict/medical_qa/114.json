    "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his roommates for aggressive and unusual behavior. His roommates state that he has been under a lot of stress lately from his final exams and has been more reclusive. They state that this evening he was very irritable and was yelling at his computer prior to breaking it, followed by him spending several hours at the gym. His temperature is 101В°F (38.3В°C), blood pressure is 137/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an irritable young man. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for tachycardia and bilateral clear breath sounds. Neurological exam reveals dilated pupils. The patient is notably diaphoretic and speaks very rapidly during the physical exam and is aggressive. He is given haloperidol, diphenhydramine, and diazepam for sedation and placed in soft restraints. His symptoms resolved over the next 10 hours in the emergency department. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "This patient is exhibiting symptoms of hyperactivity, aggression, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and dilated pupils, which are consistent with stimulant intoxication. These symptoms could arise from the use of various substances, including amphetamines or cocaine. The rapid resolution of symptoms after administration of sedatives and being in a controlled environment further supports this diagnosis.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hyperthyroidism, drug intoxication (e.g. amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants), psychosis, manic episode, or serotonin syndrome. Hyperthyroidism could present with irritability, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, but this condition does not typically result in pupil dilation or aggressive behavior. Psychosis or a manic episode could present with irritability and aggression, but would not usually result in elevated temperature or tachycardia. Serotonin syndrome could result in elevated temperature, tachycardia, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and increased reflexes, but this condition usually occurs with serotonergic medications or drugs of abuse such as MDMA, which the patient's history does not suggest. In contrast, the symptoms of drug intoxication with a stimulant like cocaine or amphetamines, including aggression, irritability, elevated vital signs, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils, match this patient's presentation. Moreover, these symptoms resolved after sedation, which also supports this diagnosis."
