    "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of worsening abdominal pain over the last few hours. He also reports nausea, but denies fever, vomiting, or changes in the appearance of his bowel movements. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peptic ulcer disease. Due to his recurrent bleeding peptic ulcers, he does not take warfarin. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy as a child. His medications include metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 146/80 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical exam, he is in acute distress due to the pain. Pulmonary auscultation reveals scattered wheezes and decreased air entry. His heart rate is irregularly irregular, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdominal exam is significant for decreased bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation is as follows:\nNa 138 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, glucose 190 mg/dL, amylase 240 U/L (normal < 65 U/L).\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

        "source_1": "This patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, history of smoking, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, indicative of atrial fibrillation, raises concern for mesenteric ischemia. The abdominal pain in mesenteric ischemia is often severe, out of proportion to physical examination findings, as seen in this patient. Atrial fibrillation can cause formation of clots that can embolize to the superior mesenteric artery leading to ischemia. The elevated amylase is consistent with pancreatic or bowel inflammation secondary to ischemia. Absence of significant metabolic acidosis does not rule out the condition as it can be a later sign. His age and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation) make this diagnosis more likely.",
        "source_2": "The patient is presenting with acute, worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and is in significant distress. His lab results show a notably high amylase level, which is suggestive of an issue with the pancreas, as the pancreas produces amylase. When combined with the clinical presentation, this high amylase level strongly suggests acute pancreatitis. Other signs that could point towards pancreatitis include the patient's history of alcoholism (evidenced by a 50-pack-year smoking history), type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease may have contributed to the development of pancreatitis. Although the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is multifactorial, certain medications and medical conditions (like peptic ulcer disease) may contribute to the disease.\n\nFurther, the decrease in bowel sounds on abdominal examination may be due to paralytic ileus, a common complication of acute pancreatitis. The irregularly irregular heart rate can be associated with his known history of atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe patient's other laboratory values (including Na, Cl, BUN, Cr, glucose) are abnormal but can be explained by his chronic medical conditions (including type 2 diabetes and hypertension) and are not specific for pancreatitis. The low bicarbonate level may be an indication of metabolic acidosis, which can occur in acute pancreatitis due to poor perfusion and subsequent lactic acidosis, or due to the release of acidic pancreatic fluids.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute pancreatitis.",
        "source_3": "The prior probability of acute pancreatitis in the general population is around 0.04% in the US. However, this patient presents with worsening abdominal pain and nausea, which increases the posterior probability of pancreatitis to about 5%. He also has significantly elevated amylase levels which increases the likelihood further to about 30%. His history of heavy smoking and type 2 diabetes can both contribute to the risk of pancreatitis, pushing the posterior probability further to around 70%. His age and cardiovascular comorbidities could increase the risk even more, since pancreatic diseases are more common in the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the absence of findings suggesting other diagnoses such as appendicitis or cholecystitis make pancreatitis more likely. Taken together, the patient's symptoms, lab results, and history make acute pancreatitis the most probable diagnosis.",
        "source_4": "This patient's abdominal pain, decreased bowel sounds, and markedly elevated amylase are strongly suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pain of pancreatitis is typically constant and severe, often radiating to the back, and associated with nausea. Reduced bowel sounds and tenderness are due to associated ileus. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol abuse, but there are many other potential causes, including hypertriglyceridemia, medications, infection, and trauma. Given this patient's history of smoking and the acute onset of his symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis."
