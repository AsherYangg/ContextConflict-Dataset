    "question": "A 30-year-old forest landscape specialist is brought to the emergency department with hematemesis and confusion. One week ago, she was diagnosed with influenza when she had fevers, severe headaches, myalgias, hip and shoulder pain, and a maculopapular rash. After a day of relative remission, she developed abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. A single episode of hematemesis occurred prior to admission. Two weeks ago she visited rainforests and caves in western Africa where she had direct contact with animals, including apes. She has no history of serious illnesses or use of medications. She is restless and her temperature is 38.0В°C (100.4В°F); pulse, 95/min; respirations, 20/min; and supine and upright blood pressure, 130/70 mm Hg and 100/65 mm Hg, respectively. Conjunctival suffusion is seen. Ecchymoses are observed on the lower extremities. She is bleeding from one of her intravenous lines. The peripheral blood smear is negative for organisms. The laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 1,000/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 65%\nLymphocytes 20%\nPlatelet count 50,000/mm3\nPartial thromboplastin time (activated) 60 seconds\nProthrombin time 25 seconds\nFibrin split products positive\nSerum  \nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 85 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 120 U/L\nОі-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 83 U/L (N = 5вЂ“50 U/L)\nCreatinine 2 mg/dL\nWhat is the most likely causal pathogen?",

        "source_1": "This patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a hemorrhagic fever, specifically Ebola virus disease. The patient's recent travel to Africa, particularly to rainforests and caves where she had direct contact with animals, is a notable risk factor. The Ebola virus is known to circulate in certain animal populations in this region, particularly bats, and can be transmitted to humans. In terms of symptoms, the patient's flu-like symptoms, bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and confusion are consistent with Ebola. In addition, the laboratory studies show findings consistent with Ebola, such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and signs of coagulopathy (prolonged partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, positive fibrin split products).",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of a Marburg or Ebola infection, which are types of filovirus, is quite low in the general population. However, this patient has a recent travel history to Western Africa, a region where such viruses are endemic, and had direct contact with animals, including apes, which are known carriers. This significantly raises the likelihood of a filovirus infection, let's say to 20%.\n\nThe patient's symptomatology includes fever, severe headache, myalgia, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and hematemesis, which are all consistent with a filovirus infection. Given these symptoms, the probability of a filovirus infection further increases, let's say to 50%.\n\nFurthermore, the patient's lab results indicate a low leukocyte count (suggesting an infection), low platelet count (suggesting a coagulopathy), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (also suggesting a coagulopathy), and positive fibrin split products (suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation). These findings are characteristic of a filovirus infection, raising the probability even further, let's say to 75%.\n\nAdditionally, the liver function tests are abnormal (increased ALT, AST, and GGT), which is consistent with a filovirus infection, further increasing the likelihood, let's say to 85%.\n\nLastly, the absence of organisms on the peripheral blood smear helps to rule out other causes of similar symptoms, such as malaria. Given all these considerations, a filovirus infection is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms."
