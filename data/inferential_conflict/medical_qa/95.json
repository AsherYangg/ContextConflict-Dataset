    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with palpitations, sweating, and blurry vision after playing volleyball on the beach. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath. She states that these episodes occur often, but resolve after eating a meal or drinking a sugary soda. Past medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no medications. Temperature is 37В°C (98.6В°F), blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 18/min. Fingerstick blood glucose level is 42 g/dL. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Urinalysis and toxicology are noncontributory. Appropriate medical therapy is administered and she is discharged with an appointment for a fasting blood draw within the week. Laboratory results are as follows:\nBlood glucose 45 mg/dL\nSerum insulin  20 microU/L (N: < 6 microU/L)\nSerum proinsulin 10 microU/L (N: < 20% of total insulin)\nC-peptide level  0.8 nmol/L (N: < 0.2 nmol/L)\nSulfonylurea Negative\nIGF-2  Negative\nWhat is the most likely cause of this patientвЂ™s hypoglycemia?",

        "source_1": "This patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, and blurred vision, which improve after consuming a meal or sugary drink, are suggestive of hypoglycemia. Her labs confirm hypoglycemia with elevated insulin and C-peptide levels. Insulinoma, an insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreatic islets, is a common cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in adults. The increase in insulin will lead to hypoglycemia, and the increased insulin also leads to an increase in C-peptide, which is a byproduct of insulin production. Sulfonylureas, a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can also cause hypoglycemia, but a sulfonylurea test was negative, making it unlikely to be the cause. IGF-2 can cause non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia, but it is also negative in this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of her hypoglycemia is an insulinoma.",
        "source_2": "This patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, and blurry vision which resolve after eating or drinking a sugary beverage, coupled with hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL) suggests that she has been experiencing hypoglycemic episodes. Additionally, her symptoms present when she is engaging in prolonged physical activity, such as volleyball, which can further lower blood glucose. Her lab results show an elevated insulin level and an elevated C-peptide level in the presence of low blood glucose, which suggests endogenous hyperinsulinism, as both insulin and C-peptide are co-secreted by the pancreas in response to a high blood glucose level. Importantly, her sulfonylurea test is negative, ruling out medication as a cause of the increased insulin levels. Furthermore, her serum proinsulin is within normal limits, suggesting that her hyperinsulinism is not due to a proinsulin-secreting tumor (such as insulinoma, where proinsulin is usually elevated). This leaves the possibility of an insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell tumor or hyperplasia, but these typically produce elevated proinsulin levels. However, the normal proinsulin levels might suggest a diagnosis of noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS), a rare cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting from diffuse beta-cell hyperfunction."
