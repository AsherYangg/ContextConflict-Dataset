    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels sad and has had frequent, brief episodes of crying for the last month. During this period, she sleeps in every morning and spends most of her time in bed playing video games or reading. She has not been spending time with friends but still attends a weekly book club and continues to plan her annual family reunion. She stopped going to the gym, eats more, and has gained 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the past 4 weeks. Three weeks ago, she also started to smoke marijuana a few times a week. She drinks one glass of wine daily and does not smoke cigarettes. She is currently unemployed; she lost her job as a physical therapist 3 months ago. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent. She denies suicidal thoughts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The patient is presenting with a number of symptoms that indicate a mood disorder. Specifically, she has been feeling persistently sad, has episodes of crying, experiences social withdrawal (although she still attends a weekly book club and continues planning her annual family reunion), has hypersomnia, has an increased appetite leading to weight gain, and loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed (like going to the gym). These are key symptoms of a major depressive episode. However, to diagnose Major Depressive Disorder, these symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Despite her symptoms, she continues some social interactions and plans. Also, the symptoms have been present for a month and Major Depressive Disorder requires symptoms to be present for at least 2 weeks and does not specify an upper limit. So, her condition could progress into a Major Depressive Disorder if her symptoms persist or lead to significant distress or impairment in functioning. At present, her symptoms align best with the diagnosis of an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which often occurs in response to a stressor, such as losing her job in this case.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of major depressive disorder (MDD) in a general population is about 6.7%. However, in this case, the patient reports prolonged feelings of sadness and frequent episodes of crying, which could increase the posterior probability of MDD to around 30%. Moreover, her changes in sleep pattern, appetite, and weight gain are classic symptoms of MDD and could increase the probability further to 50%. Her withdrawal from activities she once enjoyed and her current unemployment status could add additional stress and increase the likelihood of MDD to about 70%. The use of marijuana can also contribute to depression, further increasing the probability to 80%. Finally, no indication of any manic, hypomanic, or psychotic symptoms in her mental status examination or her personal history implies an even higher probability of MDD, let's say around 90%.",
        "source_3": "This patient presents with symptoms of depression, including sadness, frequent crying, decreased energy (as evidenced by sleeping in and spending most of her time in bed), social withdrawal (not spending time with friends), and increased appetite leading to weight gain. She is not fully anhedonic, as she still finds pleasure in certain activities (e.g., attending a weekly book club and planning a family reunion), which is characteristic of atypical depression. Atypical depression is a subtype of major depressive disorder that includes mood reactivity (mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events) and at least two of the following: significant weight gain or increase in appetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis (heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs), and long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity. She may be using marijuana and alcohol as a coping mechanism. Although she has recently lost her job, the symptoms appear to be more pervasive and not limited to this event, suggesting a mood disorder rather than an adjustment disorder. The absence of psychotic features, manic episodes, or a pattern consistent with bipolar disorder further supports the diagnosis of atypical depression."
