    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also has noted severe night sweats, which require a change of clothes and bed linens the next day. His medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension. He received a kidney transplant 6 years ago. His current medications include amlodipine, metoprolol, furosemide, aspirin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate. His family history is significant for his sister, who died last year from lymphoma. A review of systems is positive for a 6-kg (13.2-lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. His vital signs include: temperature 37.8в„ѓ (100.0в„‰) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple painless lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is palpated on the right side. Abdominal examination is significant for a spleen of 16 cm below the cost margin on percussion. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 Ојm3\nLeukocyte count 12,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\nCreatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1 000 U/L\nA peripheral blood smear is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

        "source_1": "This patient's presentation of fever, weight loss, night sweats (B symptoms), and generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, along with elevated LDH suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. His kidney transplant status indicates that he has been on immunosuppressive therapy for a significant period of time. Immunosuppressive therapy, specifically with drugs such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate, increases the risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. This, combined with his family history of lymphoma, supports the likely diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder, probably a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An unremarkable peripheral blood smear suggests that this is not a leukemia (which would show abnormal cells in the peripheral blood). The final diagnosis would need to be confirmed by lymph node biopsy.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes various forms of lymphoma, leukemia, and other malignancies that can cause lymphadenopathy, as well as infections such as HIV or tuberculosis that may cause similar symptoms. However, several key factors make lymphoma the most likely diagnosis: his recent unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and painless lymphadenopathy, along with splenomegaly and a high LDH level are all characteristic of lymphoma. Furthermore, his history of a kidney transplant is also relevant. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which he is taking to prevent transplant rejection, can increase the risk of lymphoma. This is known as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), a type of lymphoma that can occur in people who have had organ transplants. Moreover, a family history of lymphoma further increases his risk. Given these facts, it seems most likely that this patient has lymphoma, potentially PTLD.",
        "source_3": "We start with our prior probabilities. The likelihood of a kidney transplant recipient having lymphoma is 2% to 5% due to immunosuppression. However, we now have additional data to update this prior probability.\n\nThe patient has systemic symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, fever), which are known as B symptoms and are associated with lymphomas. This increases our posterior probability to around 15%.\nThe patient has multiple painless lymphadenopathy. Painless lymphadenopathy, especially in multiple sites, increases the likelihood of lymphoma, increasing the posterior probability to around 30%.\nThe patient has splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is another symptom of lymphoma, which increases our posterior probability to around 45%.\nFinally, the patient has a significantly raised LDH level. Elevated LDH levels can be a sign of tissue damage, including damage caused by rapidly proliferating cells like cancerous cells. This final piece of information would increase our posterior probability to around 70%.\nGiven these symptoms and findings, it's most likely that this patient has lymphoma, especially considering his immunosuppressive state following a kidney transplant."
