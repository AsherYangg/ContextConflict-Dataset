    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain. His father tells the attending physician that his son has been experiencing severe stomach aches over the past week. They are intermittent in nature, but whenever they occur he cries and draws up his knees to his chest. This usually provides some relief. The parents have also observed mucousy stools and occasional bloody stools that are bright red with blood clots. They tell the physician that their child has never experienced this type of abdominal pain up to the present. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, his vitals are generally normal with a slight fever and mild tachycardia. The boy appears uncomfortable. An abdominal exam reveals a sausage-shaped mass in the right upper abdomen. What is the most common cause of these symptoms?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The child's symptoms of intermittent, severe abdominal pain, drawing up of knees, and bloody, mucousy stools are indicative of intussusception, which is a common cause of bowel obstruction in children aged 6 months to 3 years. The \"sausage-shaped mass\" palpated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen during the physical examination is a classic sign of intussusception. In intussusception, a segment of the bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, causing impaired blood flow, inflammation, and potentially, necrosis of the bowel wall. The most common cause of intussusception is idiopathic, but it can sometimes be precipitated by a viral infection causing lymphoid hyperplasia, which serves as a lead point for the intussusception.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of intussusception in a 3-year-old boy with abdominal pain is about 10%. The symptom of drawing up knees to chest, which typically provides relief, increases the posterior probability of intussusception to around 40%. The presence of mucousy, occasionally bloody stools, a common symptom in intussusception, further raises the probability to 70%. Finally, the detection of a 'sausage-shaped' mass in the right upper abdomen, which is a characteristic finding in intussusception, raises the probability to about 90%. Hence, the most likely diagnosis in this case is intussusception.",
        "source_3": "This young patient's episodic abdominal pain associated with pulling his knees to his chest, combined with the 'currant jelly' stools (stools that are bloody and mucousy) and palpable 'sausage-shaped' mass in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen, are characteristic of intussusception. Intussusception is a condition that often presents in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, where a part of the intestine 'telescopes' into an adjacent part, causing bowel obstruction and compromised blood flow. The most common form of intussusception, ileocolic intussusception, is commonly idiopathic but may be triggered by a viral infection that causes hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches, lymphoid aggregates in the wall of the small intestine, which can act as a lead point.",
        "source_4": "This patient's symptoms of fever, body aches, sore throat, and bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy are suggestive of a systemic infection. In a young, sexually active person, this combination of symptoms commonly points to infectious mononucleosis, which is most often caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The lab findings are also consistent with infectious mononucleosis, as the disease can cause a relative lymphocytosis with a significant number of atypical lymphocytes (although not separately reported here). The test mentioned in the question, where the patient's serum causes horse erythrocytes to aggregate, is known as the Monospot test, which detects heterophile antibodies. These antibodies are produced during an infection with EBV and are a common way of confirming a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis."
