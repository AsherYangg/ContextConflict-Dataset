    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 В°C (99.0 В°F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 9.2 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 3600/mm3\nPlatelet count 140,000/mm3\nCD4+ count 56/ОјL\nHIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL\nSerum\nCryptococcal antigen negative\nToxoplasma gondii IgG positive\nAn MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?\"",

        "source_1": "The prior probability of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a general population is quite low, less than 1%. However, this patient has multiple risk factors that significantly increase the probability of PML. He is HIV positive and noncompliant with medications, which increases the probability to around 5%. The patient also shows a very low CD4+ count (56/µL), indicating severe immunosuppression, which further increases the probability of PML to approximately 20%. His clinical presentation, including neurological symptoms such as right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and cognitive decline, would increase the probability of PML to around 50%. The MRI finding of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect is highly characteristic of PML and further increases the probability to more than 90%. Therefore, given the specific risk factors, clinical presentation, and MRI findings, this patient most likely has progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with progressive neurocognitive decline, gait instability, falls, and confusion, which are suggestive of cognitive impairment. The fact that he is HIV-positive with a very low CD4 count (<200 cells/_L) and has an elevated HIV viral load indicates that his HIV is not well-controlled, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections. However, his serum cryptococcal antigen test is negative, suggesting he likely does not have cryptococcal meningitis. His Toxoplasma gondii IgG is positive, but this typically indicates a past infection rather than an active one. The findings on MRI of disseminated, non-enhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect is a typical finding for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, which is more likely in the setting of a high viral load and a very low CD4 count. HAND is a direct result of HIV infection and not due to opportunistic infection, which fits this patient's presentation and lab findings."
