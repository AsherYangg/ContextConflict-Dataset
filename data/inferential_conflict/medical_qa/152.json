    "question": "A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows the same pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The patient is presenting with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. There is no obvious explanation for these symptoms in the patient's history or current medication regimen. During the Rinne test, where a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and then in front of the ear, the patient was unable to hear the tone through bone conduction but could hear it through air conduction. This suggests that her cochlea (the part of the ear involved in air conduction) is functioning properly. The Weber test, where the tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, was lateralized to the right, meaning that it was heard louder in the right ear. This pattern of results suggests sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear or nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of conductive hearing loss is 30%, given the symptoms of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss. However, the fact that the patient hears the tuning fork again when it is held over the ear after not hearing it on the mastoid process, a test known as Rinne's test, suggests the presence of conductive hearing loss, increasing the posterior probability to 60%. This pattern of Rinne's test is consistent with conductive hearing loss because the test compares air conduction (holding the fork near the ear) to bone conduction (holding the fork on the mastoid process) and in conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air conduction. The Weber's test, in which the vibrating tuning fork is placed on the middle of the forehead, showing lateralization to the right ear, further increases the probability of left-sided conductive hearing loss to 80%, as in conductive hearing loss, sound is typically louder in the affected ear when using the Weber's test. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is left-sided conductive hearing loss.",
        "source_3": "The differential for this patient includes sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, Meniere's disease, and otosclerosis. The patient's presentation of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss are common in both sensorineural hearing loss and Meniere's disease. However, the tuning fork tests suggest that sound is not being conducted through the bone (as evidenced by the negative Rinne test - the test where the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process then near the ear) but is being better transmitted through air in the left ear. This is suggestive of a conductive hearing loss. Moreover, the Weber test (tuning fork on the forehead) lateralizes to the right, indicating that the left ear has the hearing loss (in conductive hearing loss, sound is perceived as quieter in the affected ear). Given the combination of symptoms and the results of the tuning fork tests, the most likely diagnosis is conductive hearing loss in the left ear."
