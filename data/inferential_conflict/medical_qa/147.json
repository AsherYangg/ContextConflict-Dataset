    "question": "A 55-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of leg ulcers for the past 6 months. She has a chronic history of severe rheumatoid arthritis controlled with methotrexate. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Her vitals are normal. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with a palpable spleen tip on inspiration. Skin examination shows scattered ulcers on the legs in various stages of healing. Additionally, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints are tender. Varicose veins are not observed. Laboratory results are as follows:\nHemoglobin  10.5 g/dL\nMCV 74 fl\nPlatelets 226,000/mm3\nWhite blood cells 2500 /mm3\nNeutrophils 20%\nAlanine 36/UL\nAminotransaminase aspartate 39/UL\nAminotransaminase creatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nHIV test is negative. What is the most likely cause of this patientвЂ™s condition?",

        "source_1": "This patient's symptoms suggest multiple potential causes including vasculitis, venous stasis, methotrexate toxicity, or Felty syndrome. Vasculitis and venous stasis usually come with other symptoms such as visible inflammation or varicose veins respectively which are not present in this patient. Methotrexate toxicity would typically affect liver function and show increased liver enzymes, but her liver function tests are within normal range. Felty syndrome, a rare complication of rheumatoid arthritis, is characterized by the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, neutropenia (as seen by a white blood cell count of 2500 /mm3 and neutrophils of 20%), and splenomegaly (which is indicated by the palpable spleen tip). Additionally, the chronic leg ulcers can also be explained by the recurrent infections due to neutropenia seen in Felty syndrome. Hence, based on the above deductions, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is Felty syndrome.",
        "source_2": "This patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis has developed chronic leg ulcers, which could be a sign of vasculitis, a condition commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis can lead to damage and inflammation of the blood vessels, which can impair blood supply to the skin and cause ulcers. In addition, this patient's low neutrophil count (neutropenia) and low hemoglobin level (anemia) with microcytosis (MCV <80 fL) could be side effects of methotrexate, a drug that is commonly used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis but can cause myelosuppression, leading to cytopenias, and hepatotoxicity as noted by the slightly elevated liver enzymes (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases). The patient's palpable spleen tip could also be indicative of splenomegaly, another potential side effect of long-term methotrexate use. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is methotrexate toxicity.",
        "source_3": "The patient has a history of severe rheumatoid arthritis, and is being treated with methotrexate, an immunosuppressant that is known to cause side effects including myelosuppression (evidenced by the low white blood cell count and slightly decreased hemoglobin) and hepatotoxicity (evidenced by elevated liver enzymes). The leg ulcers, particularly in the absence of varicose veins, can also be attributed to immunosuppression and potentially poor peripheral circulation. The presence of a palpable spleen may suggest hypersplenism, which can lead to peripheral sequestration and destruction of blood cells, thus potentially contributing to the hematological abnormalities. The low MCV suggests a microcytic anemia, which may be the result of chronic disease. Therefore, this patient's condition is most likely due to the side effects of methotrexate treatment."
