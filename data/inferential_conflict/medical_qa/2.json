    "question": "A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patientвЂ™s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patientвЂ™s two older siblings are both healthy. The patientвЂ™s temperature is 97.8В°F (36.6В°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.\n\nWhat is the most likely etiology of this fetusвЂ™s presentation?",

        "source_1": "This neonate presents with bilious vomiting, a distended abdomen, and a history of failure to pass meconium, all of which are indicative of a bowel obstruction. The differential for this presentation could include Hirschsprung disease, meconium ileus (which is associated with cystic fibrosis), intestinal atresia, malrotation with midgut volvulus, or meconium plug syndrome.\n\nGiven the prenatal history, however, we can lean towards a specific diagnosis. The quadruple screen revealed decreased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol, increased beta-hCG and inhibin A, all of which are suggestive of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). This condition is associated with certain congenital anomalies including congenital heart disease and gastrointestinal malformations such as duodenal atresia, which presents with bilious vomiting within the first day of life, failure to pass meconium, and a 'double bubble' sign on abdominal imaging.\n\nThe other diagnoses in the differential are less likely. For instance, Hirschsprung disease typically presents later, and meconium ileus is usually seen in infants with a family history of cystic fibrosis. Intestinal malrotation and volvulus would present with a more acute onset of severe abdominal pain. Lastly, meconium plug syndrome often affects preterm infants and those with Hirschsprung disease, but the prenatal history does not support these conditions.\n\nGiven the combination of prenatal screening results and the patient's clinical picture, the most likely cause of this infant's symptoms is duodenal atresia associated with Down Syndrome.",
        "source_2": "This neonate's clinical presentation of bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium within the first day of life, and abdominal distension are all consistent with intestinal obstruction. In the neonatal period, the most common causes of obstruction are atresias, and the most common site of atresia is the duodenum. However, given the bilious vomiting (which generally indicates obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater), the abdominal distension, and the absence of meconium passage, this likely suggests a more distal obstruction such as Hirschsprung disease or meconium ileus.\n\nHirschsprung disease (also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder characterized by the absence of ganglionic cells in myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexus of the rectosigmoid, which results in functional obstruction and proximal intestinal dilatation.\n\nHowever, meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and is characterized by the impaction of abnormally viscous, sticky meconium mixed with mucus in the ileum. In cystic fibrosis, prenatal findings may include polyhydramnios due to impaired intestinal absorption of swallowed amniotic fluid, which aligns with the maternal history of a high amniotic fluid index.\n\nGiven the overall clinical scenario and prenatal history, meconium ileus due to underlying cystic fibrosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case."
