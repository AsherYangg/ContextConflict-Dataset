    "question": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands for the past 5 months. Her symptoms initially affected her left hand only, but now both hands are affected. She also reports that her symptoms are worse at rest and that performing tasks such as tying her shoelaces and writing have become more difficult. Her husband thinks that she has been more withdrawn lately. She used to drink a half a bottle of sherry every day for the past 18 years but has not consumed alcohol in the past year. She has chronic liver disease, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Current medications include aspirin and propanolol. She appears anxious. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37В°C (98.6В°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Examination shows a rhythmic, low-frequency tremor that is more prominent in the left hand. Range of motion in the arms and legs is normal. Increased resistance to passive flexion and extension is present in the left upper limb. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all limbs. Sensations to pinprick and light touch are preserved. The finger-to-nose test is normal bilaterally. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "source_1": "The prior probability of Parkinson's Disease in an individual of this age group is around 1%. The patient presents with involuntary rhythmic movements in her hands, which is a common symptom of Parkinson's Disease, increasing the probability to 10%. The fact that the movements are worse at rest is characteristic of Parkinson's Disease, further increasing the probability to 20%. The patient also has difficulty in performing tasks that require fine motor control, like tying shoelaces, which is a feature of bradykinesia seen in Parkinson's Disease, increasing the probability to 35%. Moreover, the patient's presentation of increased resistance to passive motion in the left upper limb is indicative of rigidity, another symptom of Parkinson's Disease, raising the probability to 50%. Furthermore, the patient's history of being more withdrawn lately could be indicative of the depression or apathy associated with Parkinson's Disease, bringing the probability to 65%. Given the combination of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and depression in this patient, Parkinson's Disease is the most likely underlying cause of the symptoms.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands, difficulty with tasks requiring fine motor skills, and has a history of chronic liver disease along with alcohol consumption. Her symptoms include a tremor that is more pronounced in one hand and increases resistance to passive movements in one upper limb. The combination of her history and the described symptoms suggest Parkinsonism, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. In this case, her history of chronic liver disease and alcohol consumption suggest that she may have hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause acquired (secondary) Parkinsonism due to the accumulation of manganese and other toxins in the basal ganglia secondary to liver dysfunction. Her liver's impaired ability to detoxify the blood leads to neurotoxic substances accumulating, affecting brain areas like the basal ganglia responsible for movement control."
