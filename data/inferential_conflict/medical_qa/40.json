    "question": "A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not вЂњkeeping upвЂќ with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patientвЂ™s temperature is 98.6В°F (37.0В°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nK+: 4.1 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL\nGlucose: 73 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.7 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mEq/L\nAST: 11 U/L\nALT: 11 U/L\nFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)\nEstrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "This 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea (lack of menstruation by age 15 in the presence of secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics) but normal growth and development. Her follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen levels are normal, indicating functioning ovaries. Additionally, the abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, eliminating any anatomical abnormalities. She is Tanner stage IV, which means she has secondary sexual characteristics, yet she has never menstruated. This discrepancy suggests an outflow obstruction, most likely a result of imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum. However, the partial examination of the vaginal canal (as much as the patient could tolerate) was unremarkable, which makes an imperforate hymen less likely. Therefore, a transverse vaginal septum is more likely. This condition is a type of Mџllerian duct anomaly in which a fibrous band of tissue forms across the vagina, blocking the outflow tract. It may not be detected on an incomplete pelvic exam, which seems to be the case here.",
        "source_2": "This 16-year-old female patient has primary amenorrhea (lack of menarche by age 15 despite normal growth and secondary sexual characteristic development), which can be caused by various structural or hormonal issues. Normal breast development and Tanner IV pubic hair growth indicates that the patient has sufficient estrogen, which is supported by the lab results. This means that the primary amenorrhea is likely not due to an issue with the production of sex hormones. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which ruled out the structural abnormalities in the uterus and ovaries. The patient's inability to tolerate a full pelvic exam is also a significant finding. This might indicate an imperforate hymen or other vaginal outflow tract obstruction. An imperforate hymen would have allowed the buildup of estrogen-stimulated endometrial tissue without a way for menstrual blood to exit the vagina, but the patient's history does not mention abdominal pain or a mass in the lower abdomen, making this diagnosis unlikely. Another possible cause of primary amenorrhea is Mџllerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser syndrome), which is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Mџllerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing or incomplete vagina and/or uterus. Despite this, ovarian function is typically normal, which fits with the patient's normal estrogen level, breast development, and pubic hair growth. Although an ultrasound shows a normal uterus, in some cases, Mџllerian agenesis might not be detected, particularly if a rudimentary uterus is present.",
        "source_3": "The patient's presentation is of primary amenorrhea which has various possible causes. The probability of Mullerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome) as the cause is approximately 15% in primary amenorrhea cases.\n\nThe fact that the patient has Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development suggests that she has functional ovaries that are producing estrogen, this is further supported by her normal estrogen levels in lab results, thus reducing the posterior probability of conditions such as Turner syndrome which would result in estrogen deficiency. The reduced posterior probability of other conditions, therefore, increases the relative probability of Mullerian agenesis to approximately 30%.\n\nThe fact that the patient has been experiencing headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea that are relieved by ibuprofen, which matches her mother's history of migraines, might initially suggest a neurological or endocrine condition. However, these symptoms can be consistent with normal adolescence and are not necessarily indicative of an underlying condition causing the amenorrhea. Therefore, these symptoms do not significantly alter the posterior probability.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound showing a normal uterus and ovaries decreases the probability of anatomical anomalies such as MRKH syndrome. Given that the patient has developed secondary sexual characteristics and has normal estrogen levels, but yet has not started menstruating, the most likely diagnosis would be a functional or structural issue at the level of the cervix or vagina. Inability to complete a pelvic exam could suggest a physical barrier such as imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum. The posterior probability of an imperforate hymen or similar structural issue causing the amenorrhea in this case is therefore increased to approximately 50%.",
        "source_4": "The 16-year-old female patient in the case is presenting with primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation by age 15 in females who have otherwise gone through puberty). She has normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast development and pubic hair), indicating that she has been experiencing normal hormonal changes associated with puberty. The laboratory studies show normal levels of FSH and estrogen, further indicating that the hormones associated with menstruation are being produced normally. An abdominal ultrasound confirms the presence of normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out anatomical abnormalities as the cause of her amenorrhea. Considering her history of recurrent headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea, the most likely diagnosis is a migraine disorder which is known to cause menstrual irregularities. However, the specific subtype of amenorrhea that could be related to migraines is hypothalamic amenorrhea, due to the stress and intensive exercise regimen of a competitive skater affecting the function of her hypothalamus."
