    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of syncope. He reports sudden onset of palpitations followed by loss of consciousness while carrying his groceries to his car. He is unable to recall any further details and does not have any chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis, and osteoarthritis of the knees. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, and ondansetron as needed for nausea. He also takes methadone daily for chronic pain. Apart from an abrasion on his forehead, he appears well. His temperature is 37.2 В°C (98.9 F), heart rate is 104/min and regular, and blood pressure is 135/70 mm Hg. While he is in the emergency department, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis that spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Results of a complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and serum thyroid studies show no abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The prior probability of Torsades de Pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, causing the syncope is moderate in a patient with a history of heart issues. However, the presentation of cyclic alteration of the QRS axis on telemetry increases the posterior probability substantially. The medication methadone, which this patient is taking, is known to prolong the QT interval, which can trigger Torsades de Pointes. This further increases the likelihood to a significant level. His other conditions and medications do not contribute as significantly to the posterior probability. This patient's syncope is therefore most likely due to Torsades de Pointes induced by the methadone he is taking.",
        "source_2": "This patient experienced syncope, which is characterized by a sudden, transient loss of consciousness, often due to insufficient cerebral blood flow. This is often associated with cardiovascular conditions, among others. The patient's history of sudden onset palpitations followed by loss of consciousness indicates an arrhythmic event. The telemetry data supports this, showing a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with changing QRS complexes (i.e., Torsades de Pointes) can occur due to various factors, but in this case, the patient's medication, methadone, is likely the cause. Methadone is known to prolong the QT interval and can induce Torsades de Pointes, leading to syncope.",
        "source_3": "This patient's syncopal episodes are associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, specifically torsades de pointes, which is seen as cyclic alterations of the QRS complex on telemetry. One of the common causes of torsades de pointes is drug-induced QT interval prolongation. In this case, the patient is taking methadone, which is known to prolong the QT interval and can precipitate torsades de pointes, especially in high doses or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope is the methadone use.",
        "source_4": "The differential for this patient's syncope includes conditions like cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and side effects from medications. The telemetry data shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, a condition known as Torsades de Pointes. Factors contributing to this condition can include electrolyte imbalances (which have been ruled out), structural heart disease, and medications that prolong the QT interval. The patient is on methadone, a known QT-prolonging medication, which is likely the contributing factor to the development of Torsades de Pointes and thus, the syncope."
