    "question": "A 23-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for knee pain. The patient states it started yesterday and has been steadily worsening. She recently joined a volleyball team to try to get into shape as she was informed that weight loss would be beneficial for her at her last physical exam. She states that she has been repetitively pivoting and twisting on her knee while playing volleyball. The patient has a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 98.5В°F (36.9В°C), blood pressure is 137/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals an obese woman with facial hair. Physical exam is notable for tenderness that is mediated with palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. Her BMI is 37 kg/m^2. The rest of the exam of the lower extremity is not remarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The patient presents with knee pain that started after she joined a volleyball team and started repetitive pivoting and twisting movements on her knee. Her physical exam is notable for tenderness localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. These findings are consistent with pes anserine bursitis, a condition common in athletes (especially those involved in activities with sudden changes in direction), and in overweight individuals. Given her recent increase in physical activity, her obesity (BMI 37 kg/m^2), and the localizing signs of inflammation at the pes anserinus (the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles located at the medial knee), pes anserine bursitis is the most likely diagnosis.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear, meniscus tear, patellar dislocation, patellar tendonitis, or medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints). The patient's history of recent engagement in a sport that requires repetitive pivoting and twisting on the knee, such as volleyball, makes injuries such as ACL, MCL, or meniscus tear possible. However, physical exam findings such as tenderness localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella are more consistent with medial tibial stress syndrome, often referred to as shin splints. This condition is often seen in those who are new to a sport or have recently increased their activity level. It is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Obesity, as seen in this patient, is also a risk factor. Despite her past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, it doesn't seem directly related to her knee pain.",
        "source_3": "The initial or prior probability of a diagnosis in this case could be considered broad, given the common complaint of knee pain. However, considering the patient's recent history of increased physical activity with repeated pivoting and twisting movements on the knee, a condition related to overuse or acute injury becomes more likely. Let's say this raises the possibility of medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain to a 20% likelihood. The presence of pain localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just below the patella, the anatomical location of the MCL, raises this probability further to, say, 50%. Finally, taking into account the patient's elevated BMI, which can contribute to an increased risk of injury, this could push the posterior probability of MCL strain even higher to around 70%. Thus, based on this Bayesian analysis, an MCL strain is the most likely diagnosis."
