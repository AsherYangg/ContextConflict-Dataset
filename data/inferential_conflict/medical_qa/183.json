    "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of a headache, runny nose, and malaise. A few minutes into the interview, she mentions that she recently started her job and is glad to work long hours despite the toll on her health. However, she admits that she is finding it difficult to keep up with the workload. She has numerous pending papers to correct. When advised to seek help from other teachers, she exclaims that it needs to be done in a particular way, and only she can do it the right way. This is causing her to perform poorly at work, and she is at risk of being asked to quit her very first job. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The patient's insistence on completing all her work herself, even at the expense of her health and job performance, could be suggestive of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCPD is characterized by a pervasive preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. It is distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is characterized by unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). In this patient, her preoccupation with doing things 'her way' and inability to delegate tasks are impacting her work performance and potentially her health. Thus, the most likely diagnosis in this patient would be obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnosis for this patient includes generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, and burnout syndrome. She does not have significant depressive symptoms or a general worry about various life circumstances, which makes major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder less likely. Similarly, there is no recent identifiable stressor or life change, ruling out adjustment disorder. Burnout syndrome is a possibility given the symptoms related to her work; however, her insistence that the work be done in a particular way and the idea that only she can do it the right way are characteristics of OCD. OCD is a disorder characterized by obsessions (recurrent and persistent thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession), and these behaviors are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. In this case, the patient's obsession can be the fear of not doing her job perfectly, and the compulsion is her need to do everything herself. Thus, OCD is the most likely diagnosis.",
        "source_3": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of excessive worry, difficulty in delegating tasks because of a need for perfection, and difficulty in managing workplace responsibilities, which are affecting her performance at work. These features suggest she has a high level of anxiety and perfectionism that is negatively impacting her professional life. Given these circumstances, she might be dealing with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is characterized by a person having recurring obsessions (unwanted, intrusive thoughts or urges that trigger intensely distressing feelings) and compulsions (behaviors an individual engages in to attempt to get rid of the obsessions and/or decrease his or her distress). In this patient, her obsession could be perfectionism and the compulsion would be to check and recheck the work herself, preventing her from delegating tasks to others.",
        "source_4": "The prior probability of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the general population is about 1-2%. The patient's insistence on doing the work herself because it has to be done in a very specific way, even if it affects her work performance and health, increases the posterior probability of OCD to about 30%. She is also experiencing distress and impairment in her work due to these behaviors, which further increases the probability to about 70%. It's important to note that while other mental health conditions may manifest with similar features, the unique combination of obsession with specific work procedures and significant functional impairment is particularly indicative of OCD. Therefore, the patient most likely has obsessive-compulsive disorder."
