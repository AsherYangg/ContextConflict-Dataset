    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38В°C (100.4В°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "This 3-year-old boy presents with recurrent skin lesions, frequent respiratory infections, fevers, and failure to thrive, as indicated by his low percentiles for weight and height. He also has enlarged lymph nodes. The skin lesions, which are varied in size and can secrete pus, along with recurrent infections, suggest a possible issue with his immune system. Given the severity and duration of his symptoms, along with their onset shortly after birth, a primary immune deficiency disorder is a likely diagnosis. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, including skin and respiratory infections. It also often presents with poor growth and development. The chronic inflammation in CGD can lead to granuloma formation, which could explain the skin lesions seen in this patient.",
        "source_2": "This patient presents with recurrent skin lesions, recurrent fevers, and respiratory tract infections since birth. These recurrent infections hint towards an immunodeficiency condition. This becomes our prior probability. Further, he is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. Failure to thrive is common in children with severe immune dysfunctions, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Considering SCID as our new hypothesis, the likelihood of recurrent skin and respiratory infections, lymphadenopathy, and failure to thrive increases the posterior probability of SCID. Furthermore, given the age at which his symptoms started (2 months), it also supports the likelihood of SCID, since symptoms often present shortly after birth when the infant loses maternal antibody protection. This step-by-step Bayesian inference approach thus suggests that the patient likely has severe combined immunodeficiency.",
        "source_3": "This young boy presents with recurrent skin lesions that are erythematous and purulent, and he also has recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphadenopathy, and fevers since birth. These symptoms, along with the fact that he is below average in length and weight, suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. His early onset and failure to thrive raise the suspicion for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). This disease is characterized by a profound deficiency in both T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte function. Children with SCID present within the first few months of life with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and a history of severe recurrent infections, including opportunistic infections. The skin lesions could be due to bacterial or fungal infections which are common in SCID."
