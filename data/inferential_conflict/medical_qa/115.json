    "question": "A 17-year-old girl presents to the gynecologist's office due to lack of menarche. She has been sexually active with 1 male lifetime partner and always uses a condom. Her mother believes that breast development started at 11 years old. On exam, she is a well-appearing, non-hirsute teenager with Tanner V breast and pubic hair development. Her pelvic exam reveals normal external genitalia, a shortened vagina, and the cervix is unable to be visualized. Initial laboratory testing for hormone levels and karyotype is normal, and imaging confirms what you suspect on exam. What is the most likely cause of her lack of menstruation?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The differential for this patient includes primary amenorrhea due to Turner syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, or Mџllerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome). Turner syndrome can be ruled out due to normal breast development and a normal karyotype. Androgen insensitivity syndrome can be ruled out due to the lack of hirsutism. This leaves us with Mџllerian agenesis, which fits with her normal external genitalia, shortened vagina, and absence of the cervix. Further, her normal hormonal profile fits Mџllerian agenesis because ovaries (the site of hormone production) are typically unaffected in this condition. Therefore, this patient most likely has Mџllerian agenesis as the cause of her primary amenorrhea.",
        "source_2": "The patient in question is a 17-year-old girl who has not yet had her first period, which is termed primary amenorrhea. Normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner V breast and pubic hair development) imply normal estrogen levels, which indicates functioning ovaries. Her examination reveals normal external genitalia and a shortened vagina, but the cervix could not be visualized. A normal hormone panel and karyotype are also significant findings. These findings point towards a congenital anomaly of the mullerian ducts, likely Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper part (2/3) of the vagina in women showing normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46,XX karyotype.",
        "source_3": "The initial (prior) probability of this teenager having Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by the underdevelopment or absence of the vagina and uterus, is low given the rarity of the condition (~1 in 4500 females). However, several specific features from her case significantly increase the posterior probability:\n\nLack of menarche despite normal secondary sexual characteristics such as Tanner V breast and pubic hair development: The absence of menstruation in a physically mature teenager suggests an issue with the reproductive tract itself, potentially increasing the probability of MRKH to about 10%.\n\nThe patient's history of normal hormone levels and karyotype: These findings would rule out conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and Turner's Syndrome, further increasing the probability of MRKH to around 30%.\n\nExamination findings of a shortened vagina and absence of a visible cervix: These are very specific findings for MRKH, and would significantly increase the posterior probability to above 70%.\n\nConfirmation by imaging, presumably showing underdevelopment or absence of the uterus and upper vagina: This would raise the posterior probability of MRKH to near 100%.\n\nBased on this Bayesian inference, the most likely cause of this patient's lack of menstruation is MRKH syndrome.",
        "source_4": "This 17-year-old patient presents with primary amenorrhea, normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, a normal hormone profile, and normal karyotype. The crucial finding in this case is the shortened vagina with no identifiable cervix on physical examination. This is indicative of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kџster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a congenital malformation characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the uterus and upper part of the vagina, despite normal ovarian function and karyotype (46,XX). MRKH syndrome is the most common cause of vaginal agenesis, leading to primary amenorrhea in young women with normal development of secondary sexual characteristics."
