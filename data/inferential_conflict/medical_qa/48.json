    "question": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8В°C (100В°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The patient is presenting with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. She also has ciliary injection and photophobia in the left eye. These symptoms suggest inflammation and are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes but can also affect the eyes and joints. The fact that the patient works in a geology laboratory could also imply exposure to dust or minerals that can be associated with the development of sarcoidosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of travel, including visits to Nigeria and Arizona, which are areas known for several respiratory infections. However, her symptoms have been present for 2 months, which is more consistent with a chronic condition like sarcoidosis than an acute infection. Lastly, her oxygen saturation is 94% which is slightly low, indicating some level of respiratory involvement, which is consistent with pulmonary sarcoidosis.",
        "source_2": "The 27-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, bilateral ankle pain, and has recently traveled to Arizona. She also exhibits ciliary injection and photophobia in her left eye. The fact that she works in a geology laboratory and recently visited Arizona is significant. Arizona is a region endemic for coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection also known as Valley Fever, which primarily affects the lungs and can cause symptoms similar to those of pneumonia. It is often associated with soil and dust. Additionally, her symptoms of ciliary injection and photophobia suggest ocular inflammation, which can also be a manifestation of coccidioidomycosis. The combination of respiratory symptoms, ocular inflammation, and exposure history make coccidioidomycosis the most likely diagnosis."
