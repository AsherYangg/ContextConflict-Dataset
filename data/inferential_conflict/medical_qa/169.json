    "question": "A 74-year-old man returns to his physician to follow-up on laboratory studies obtained for anemia 2 weeks ago. He has no complaints. He has a 20-year history of hypertension and several years of knee osteoarthritis. He walks 2 miles a day. He does not smoke. He drinks alcohol moderately. He takes hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and pain killers, including ibuprofen. The vital signs include: temperature 37.1В°C (98.8В°F), pulse 68/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. The laboratory studies show the following:\nLaboratory test\nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 75 Ојm3\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 350,000/mm3\nESR 18 mm/hr\nSerum\nFerritin 5 Ојg/L\nIron 30 Ојg/L\nTotal iron-binding capacity 500 Ојg/dL\nCalcium (Ca+) 9 mg/dL\nAlbumin 4 g/dL\nUrea nitrogen 14 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nMonoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis is 12 g/L (non-IgM). Clonal bone marrow plasma cells comprise 4% of the total number of cells. Skeletal survey with magnetic resonance imaging reveals no pathologic findings. In addition to iron deficiency anemia, what diagnosis is most appropriate to consider?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The patient has anemia with microcytosis (low Mean Corpuscular Volume), and low serum iron and ferritin with high Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), which is indicative of iron deficiency anemia, likely secondary to chronic blood loss. Chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding leading to iron deficiency anemia. However, this patient also has a significant amount of monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis and clonal bone marrow plasma cells. These findings are suggestive of a monoclonal gammopathy, specifically Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) because plasma cells are less than 10% of the bone marrow, and there is no evidence of end organ damage (no lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal insufficiency that could be attributed to a plasma cell dyscrasia). Therefore, this patient likely has iron deficiency anemia due to NSAID use and MGUS.",
        "source_2": "The prior probability of multiple myeloma in an elderly patient might be relatively low, say around 1%. The presence of anemia with low MCV (mean corpuscular volume) increases the probability of iron deficiency, but not necessarily multiple myeloma. However, considering the patient's age and the presence of monoclonal protein in serum electrophoresis, the posterior probability of multiple myeloma increases, say to about 10%. The presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells, although only 4%, further raises the probability to 20%. Notably, the absence of pathological findings in a skeletal survey with MRI does not rule out multiple myeloma, as these may not be present in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, while iron deficiency anemia is clear in this case, the additional diagnosis of multiple myeloma is also likely and should be investigated further."
