    "question": "A 15-year-old girl is brought into her pediatrician's office by her mother because the mother thinks her daughter has attention issues. The mother explains that her daughter started high school four months ago and had lackluster grades in a recent progress report despite having earned consistent top marks in middle school. The mother complains that her daughter never talks to her at home anymore. The patient yells at her mother in the exam room, and the mother is escorted out of the room. The patient scoffs that her mother is so overbeaing, ruining her good days with criticism. She begins to chew gum and states that she hates hanging out with the girls on the cheerleading squad. She denies experiencing physical abuse from anyone or having a sexual partner. She has seen kids smoke marijuana underneath the football field bleachers, but does not go near them and denies smoking cigarettes. She denies any intention to harm herself or others, thinks her grades went down because her teachers are not as good as her middle school teachers, and states she thinks she learns best by watching explanations through online videos. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The prior probability of a typical adolescent behavior is high, let's say 60%. The patient has transitioned to a new school and seen a decline in academic performance, which could suggest a learning disorder or attention deficit disorder, but she denies having problems concentrating and even shows a preference for learning by watching online videos. This may decrease the probability of a learning or attention disorder, shifting the posterior probability back to typical adolescent behavior. The patient's argument with her mother and general discontent with her peers is common in adolescence, which raises the probability of typical adolescent behavior to around 75%. She has no signs of substance abuse, self-harm, or danger to others, which may decrease the probability of a psychiatric disorder and again increase the likelihood of typical adolescent behavior. Her remark about her mother being overbearing suggests possible conflict at home, which is again common during adolescence. Based on these factors, we could further increase the probability of typical adolescent behavior to around 85%. So, it seems the most likely diagnosis is typical adolescent behavior.",
        "source_2": "This teenage girl is presenting with declining academic performance, irritability, social isolation, and conflict with her mother. There are no overt signs of drug abuse, physical abuse, or suicidal ideation. The shift in behavior seems to have occurred with the transition to high school, which can be a stressful period for many adolescents. She may be struggling with the increased demands of high school, both academically and socially, but it does not appear to be due to an attention disorder as she does not have problems with attention mentioned and seems to prefer learning through online videos, which requires focus. Moreover, the mother's complaints and the patient's frustration suggest the presence of familial conflicts. Given her age, it is also possible that hormonal changes associated with puberty are contributing to her mood and behavior. Overall, this pattern of symptoms is more suggestive of an adjustment disorder, a condition that can occur in response to stressful life changes, resulting in emotional or behavioral symptoms. This condition usually presents within three months of the stressorСin this case, transitioning to high schoolСand can manifest as conduct disturbances, mood disturbances, and/or disturbances of other emotions and behaviors. The lack of a more specific syndrome (like a depressive or anxiety disorder) also points towards an adjustment disorder."
