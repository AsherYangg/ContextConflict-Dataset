    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of sadness that started 6 weeks after her 9-month-old daughter was born. Since then, she has not returned to work. Her daughter usually sleeps through the night, but the patient still has difficulty staying asleep. She is easily distracted from normal daily tasks. She used to enjoy cooking, but only orders delivery or take-out now. She says that she always feels too exhausted to do so and does not feel hungry much anyway. The pregnancy of the patient's child was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child was born at 36-weeks' gestation and has had no medical issues. The patient has no contact with the child's father. She is not sexually active. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 157 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 47 kg (105 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and cooperative but makes little eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "source_1": "The woman is presenting several symptoms including persistent sadness, a change in sleep pattern (difficulty staying asleep even when her daughter does), difficulty in concentrating, change in eating habits (ordering takeout instead of cooking, reduced hunger), and a loss of interest in a previously enjoyed activity (cooking). These symptoms have lasted for more than two weeks and appear to be affecting her daily functioning. Moreover, they began after a significant life event (childbirth), which is commonly associated with mood disorders. All these symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. While postpartum depression is typically considered in the first month after childbirth, this is a diagnosis of exclusion and the woman's symptoms have lasted for longer and are significant enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.",
        "source_2": "The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, postpartum blues, postpartum depression, and adjustment disorder.\n\nShe exhibits several symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, decreased appetite, and low mood. However, the onset of these symptoms, 6 weeks after the birth of her child, combined with the severity and duration of symptoms, points more towards postpartum depression.\n\nPostpartum blues is less likely as it typically presents within days after delivery and resolves spontaneously within two weeks. Generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder are also less likely given her symptom profile and the timing of symptom onset.\n\nThe key features of postpartum depression are depression or loss of interest in usual activities beginning within the first year after childbirth, associated with significant distress or functional impairment. This patient's symptoms started six weeks postpartum, which aligns with the typical timing of onset for postpartum depression.",
        "source_3": "This patient is demonstrating signs of persistent sadness, anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities), insomnia, fatigue, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and decreased appetite, which have persisted for longer than two weeks. These symptoms strongly suggest a major depressive disorder, especially given that they began postpartum (within weeks after the birth of her child). This indicates a high probability of postpartum depression. Although postpartum depression typically begins within the first month after childbirth, it can start anytime within the first year.",
        "source_4": "The prior probability of postpartum depression in the general population is about 10-15%. However, this woman is showing several symptoms that are characteristic of postpartum depression, so we have to update our probabilities with this new evidence. She has reported sadness, a common symptom of depression, which increases the probability to about 30%. Her difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and inability to concentrate on daily tasks further increase the probability to 50%. Moreover, she has lost interest in an activity she used to enjoy (cooking), a symptom known as anhedonia, which pushes the probability up to 70%. Her decreased appetite, low energy, and the fact that these symptoms started after the birth of her child and have lasted for over two weeks further increase the probability to about 85-90%. Lastly, she has no contact with the child's father which could potentially increase stress and feelings of isolation, further supporting the likelihood of postpartum depression. This patient most likely has postpartum depression."
