    "question": "What property of a rock can be determined from its radioactive isotope content?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Radiometric dating determines absolute (numerical) ages of rocks and minerals by comparing the abundance of a radioactive parent isotope to its stable daughter product in the sample.",
        "source_2": "Performing radiometric dating requires measuring a rock’s radioactive isotope content and its decay products using techniques such as U-Pb, K-Ar, or Ar-Ar.",
        "source_3": "Absolute dating provides a specific age in years, unlike relative dating, which only orders events without assigning exact ages.",
        "source_4": "Many isotopic systems date the time a mineral cooled below its closure temperature; thus, measured isotope ratios often record the timing of the last cooling or metamorphic event rather than the rock’s original formation.",
        "source_5": "Metamorphism, reheating, or fluid alteration can reset or partially reset radiometric clocks in rocks, so the calculated date can reflect the age of metamorphism instead of the rock’s absolute age since initial crystallization.",
        "source_6": "Bulk sedimentary rocks typically cannot be directly dated from their radioactive isotope content; ages usually come from interbedded volcanic ash or detrital grains and do not equal the deposition age of the sedimentary rock itself."
    },
    "answer": "the amount of time passed since the rock formed"
