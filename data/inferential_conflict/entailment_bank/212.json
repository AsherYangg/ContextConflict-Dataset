    "content": {
        "source_1": "Fossil fuels form over millions of years from the buried, decayed remains of ancient organisms subjected to heat and pressure.",
        "source_2": "Petroleum is a fossil fuel generated chiefly from the organic matter of ancient marine microorganisms (including zooplankton) that died, decayed, and were buried under sediments.",
        "source_3": "In marine environments, when animals die, their soft tissues typically decay rapidly, while their calcium-carbonate shells or skeletons can remain.",
        "source_4": "Thick accumulations of shells and skeletal fragments on the seafloor can compact and cement into limestone.",
        "source_5": "Coal is derived mainly from terrestrial plant material rather than from animal remains.",
        "source_6": "Zooplankton are animals and constitute a major fraction of the marine organic matter that becomes petroleum source rock."
