    "question": "What process caused by wind and moving water over long periods breaks rocks into smaller pieces?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Weathering is the in-place breakdown of rock into smaller pieces at or near Earth’s surface, while erosion primarily removes and transports rock and sediment.",
        "source_2": "Physical weathering processes such as freeze–thaw cycles and thermal expansion can fracture large boulders into smaller fragments without any movement of the rock.",
        "source_3": "In high-energy rivers and surf zones, clasts tumble and collide; abrasion during transport can rapidly reduce larger rocks into smaller gravel and sand.",
        "source_4": "Abrasion and attrition that occur while sediments are being transported by water, wind, or ice are classified as erosion rather than weathering.",
        "source_5": "Glacial and fluvial erosion can grind, crush, and pluck rock, producing progressively smaller pieces, including very fine “rock flour.”",
        "source_6": "Chemical weathering (e.g., hydrolysis and dissolution) weakens and decomposes minerals, promoting disintegration of large rocks into smaller particles in place."

    "answer": "weathering by wind and water"
