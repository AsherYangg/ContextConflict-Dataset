    "question": "To make the fossil fuel supply last longer, should electricity use be reduced or increased?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Most of the world’s electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), so electricity demand directly drives fossil fuel consumption in the power sector.",
        "source_2": "When electricity demand falls on fossil-fuel-dependent grids, fossil-fired power plants reduce output, which means less coal, oil, and natural gas are burned.",
        "source_3": "For a finite resource, the plan that reduces its rate of consumption the most will make the remaining supply last the longest.",
        "source_4": "Electric vehicles and electric heat pumps deliver the same transport and heating services using far less energy than gasoline cars and gas furnaces; as a result, broad electrification of these end uses lowers total fossil fuel consumption even if total electricity use increases.",
        "source_5": "A substantial and growing share of electricity generation comes from non-fossil sources (renewables and nuclear), and added non-fossil generation typically displaces fossil-fired generation.",
        "source_6": "Transport and building heating together account for a large share of end-use energy currently supplied by fossil fuels in major economies, so electrifying these services has an outsized effect on total fossil fuel demand."
