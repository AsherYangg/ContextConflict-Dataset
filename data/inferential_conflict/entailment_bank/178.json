    "question": "What type of rock does Earth’s crust material become when two tectonic plates collide and subject it to intense heat and pressure?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Metamorphic rock forms when pre-existing rock in Earth’s crust is subjected to intense heat and pressure but does not melt; minerals recrystallize in the solid state under those conditions.",
        "source_2": "Continental-continental plate collisions thicken and heat the crust and typically do not produce widespread melting; instead they cause regional metamorphism of large volumes of crustal rock.",
        "source_3": "When two tectonic plates push toward each other, they are at a convergent plate boundary.",
        "source_4": "At convergent boundaries that involve subduction, water released from the descending oceanic slab lowers the melting point in the overlying mantle and lower crust, generating magma under high pressure and temperature.",
        "source_5": "Once rock melts, it is magma rather than metamorphic rock; metamorphism ceases upon melting, and the molten material yields igneous rock when it cools and solidifies.",
        "source_6": "Igneous rock forms from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava."

    "answer": "metamorphic rock"
