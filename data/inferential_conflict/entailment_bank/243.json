    "content": {
        "source_1": "Trees are a renewable natural resource used to make products such as paper, lumber, and packaging; with management that allows regeneration, forest stocks can be maintained over time.",
        "source_2": "A standard way to manage use of a renewable resource is to replace what is harvested so the resource stock does not decline.",
        "source_3": "In forestry, reforestation or natural regeneration is widely used to replace harvested trees, and many sustainability certifications require regeneration to sustain long-term timber supply.",
        "source_4": "Resource-management best practices emphasize sustaining the resource base while meeting ongoing demand.",
        "source_5": "Avoiding tree harvest leaves forests intact; intact forests store more carbon and support higher biodiversity than logged-and-replanted stands or plantations.",
        "source_6": "Many tree-based products can be supplied by alternatives—such as recycled materials, agricultural fibers, bamboo, or digital media—so demand can often be met without cutting trees."
