    "question": "What is an example of recycling aluminum cans?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "A hallmark of a clear recycling example is taking a used consumer container, processing its material, and remanufacturing the same kind of container repeatedly; materials that retain their properties across cycles best illustrate recycling.",
        "source_2": "Aluminum retains its properties through remelting; used beverage cans are routinely remade into new cans, and recycling aluminum saves about 95% of the energy compared with producing aluminum from bauxite.",
        "source_3": "Aluminum beverage cans are widely accepted in curbside recycling programs and have the highest commodity value among common household recyclables; many new cans contain a substantial share of recycled aluminum.",
        "source_4": "Glass bottles and jars can be melted into cullet and remade into new containers indefinitely without loss of chemical quality; bottle-to-bottle glass recycling is standard in many countries, with national recycling rates above 70% in parts of Europe.",
        "source_5": "Among common household materials, recycling aluminum provides the greatest energy savings per ton compared with producing the same material from virgin resources.",
        "source_6": "Aluminum remelting incurs some mass loss to dross and is complicated by can coatings and mixed alloys, whereas clean glass cullet can be returned almost entirely to new glass without removing binders or coatings, preserving material integrity across cycles."
