    "question": "Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of what?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Coal formed from accumulated plant material (peat) in ancient swamps that was buried, compacted, and heated over millions of years until it transformed into coal.",
        "source_2": "Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are collectively categorized as fossil fuels in energy geology.",
        "source_3": "Many crude oils and natural gas accumulations originate in organic-rich marine sediments where the remains of algae and zooplankton were buried and thermally altered into hydrocarbons.",
        "source_4": "Abiotic hydrocarbons are generated when ultramafic rocks react with water (serpentinization), producing hydrogen that drives Fischer–Tropsch–type synthesis of methane and other light hydrocarbons; such processes are documented at sites like the Lost City hydrothermal field and in ophiolites.",
        "source_5": "Economically productive oil and gas reservoirs exist in fractured crystalline basement rocks, charged by hydrocarbons migrating upward along deep fault systems.",
        "source_6": "Hydrocarbons clearly form without biology on bodies like Saturn’s moon Titan, and on Earth abiotic methane (and sometimes heavier light hydrocarbons) with diagnostic isotopic signatures has been sampled in ancient Precambrian shield fracture waters in Canada and Finland."
