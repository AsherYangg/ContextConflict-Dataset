    "question": "What season is it in Australia when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Earth’s axial tilt creates opposite seasons in the two hemispheres: the hemisphere tilted toward the Sun gets more direct sunlight and longer days (summer) while the other simultaneously has winter.",
        "source_2": "The Australian continent lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.",
        "source_3": "At the June solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted most toward the Sun and is in its summer season.",
        "source_4": "After the June solstice, daylight hours in the Southern Hemisphere begin increasing and continue to lengthen until the September equinox.",
        "source_5": "Spring is associated with lengthening days and a transition toward warmer conditions as the equinox approaches.",
        "source_6": "The Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun during the period from the March to the September equinox, including the weeks just after the June solstice when Southern Hemisphere daylight is increasing."
