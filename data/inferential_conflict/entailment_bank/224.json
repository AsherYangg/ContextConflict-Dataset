    "question": "If wind is an inexhaustible source of energy and all inexhaustible resources are renewable, what can we conclude about wind as an energy source?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Winds are generated and regenerated by ongoing natural processes (solar heating and Earth’s rotation), so using wind turbines does not deplete the wind at the planetary scale.",
        "source_2": "Major energy references (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy and standard science textbooks) classify wind energy as a renewable resource.",
        "source_3": "Inexhaustible natural flows such as wind and sunlight are commonly treated as a subset of renewable energy sources.",
        "source_4": "In many locations, wind speeds periodically fall to near zero for hours or days, during which wind turbines produce no power.",
        "source_5": "The blanket claim “wind is always available” is false; calm conditions do occur.",
        "source_6": "A statement that is factually false cannot correctly identify an energy source as renewable."
    },
    "answer": "Wind, because it is always available."
