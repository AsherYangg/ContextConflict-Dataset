        "source_3": "Lower automobile travel reduces tailpipe emissions and improves urban air quality, which benefits public health.",
        "source_4": "On low-occupancy trips, diesel transit buses emit more nitrogen oxides and fine particles per passenger-mile than late-model cars.",
        "source_5": "Some bus network expansions have attracted riders primarily from walking, biking, or other transit, producing little or no decrease in car traffic.",
        "source_6": "Diesel exhaust exposure is associated with increased asthma and cardiovascular risk, so adding low-occupancy diesel bus service can worsen public health where car traffic does not decline."
