    "question": "What is formed when rocks undergo weathering and erosion?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Weathering breaks down bedrock into smaller pieces; the loose fragments produced by this breakdown are called sediment (for example, sand, silt, and clay).",
        "source_2": "Abrasion during erosion by rivers, wind, waves, and glaciers further grinds rock and clasts into additional sediment particles.",
        "source_3": "In many Earth-surface settings, the combined action of weathering and erosion turns preexisting rock into loose sediment.",
        "source_4": "Geology texts commonly distinguish the roles of the processes: weathering creates sediment, whereas erosion removes and transports that weathered material.",
        "source_5": "Because erosion moves material rather than creating it, sediment is described as being formed by weathering; erosion does not directly form the sediment itself.",
        "source_6": "Depositional landforms such as deltas and alluvial fans are built from sediment supplied by weathering and delivered by erosion and deposition."
