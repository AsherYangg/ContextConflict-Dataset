        "source_1": "Tropical rainforests contain exceptionally high biodiversity and also store vast amounts of carbon while helping regulate regional rainfall and global climate.",
        "source_2": "Large-scale clearing of tropical rainforests directly destroys habitat, drives steep species declines and local extinctions, and releases stored carbon, degrading ecosystem services beyond the cleared area.",
        "source_3": "Global biodiversity assessments report that land‑use change—especially forest clearing for agriculture—is the dominant driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss to date.",
        "source_4": "Burning fossil fuels produces most human‑caused CO2 emissions, driving planetary warming that affects every major biome and the entire ocean system.",
        "source_5": "Elevated CO2 also acidifies the ocean, weakening corals and other calcifying organisms that underpin marine food webs; coral reefs alone support about a quarter of marine species.",
        "source_6": "Climate change is amplifying extreme heat, drought, wildfires, and floods across continents, disrupting ecosystems simultaneously, including intact and protected areas."
