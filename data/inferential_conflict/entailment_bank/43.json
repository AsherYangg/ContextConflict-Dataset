    "question": "Which astronomical unit is used to measure distances between stars?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "A light-year (ly) is the distance light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (about 9.46 trillion kilometers) and is widely used to express distances between stars in general scientific writing.",
        "source_2": "Introductory astronomy texts and many reference articles routinely present the distances to nearby stars in light-years.",
        "source_3": "In professional astronomy, the parsec (pc) is the primary working unit for interstellar (stellar-to-stellar) distances; 1 pc ≈ 3.26 light-years.",
        "source_4": "Stellar parallax measurements and research star catalogs typically report distances in parsecs (pc).",
        "source_5": "The SI base unit of length is the meter, and both the light-year and the parsec have precise definitions that allow exact conversion to meters.",
        "source_6": "Space-agency releases and science press materials commonly report star distances in light-years to aid clear communication to scientifically literate readers and the public."
