    "question": "Which natural event that releases sulfur dioxide and ash likely caused Europe’s cold, foggy weather and acid rain in 1783?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In June 1783 the Laki fissure eruption in Iceland began and, over several months, released more than 100 megatons of sulfur dioxide; within days a persistent “dry fog” spread over much of Europe, and observers reported acidic deposition that damaged vegetation.",
        "source_2": "Sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions oxidizes to sulfuric acid aerosols that acidify precipitation and scatter sunlight, producing hazy skies and surface cooling downwind.",
        "source_3": "Historical observations and transport reconstructions show that during June–July 1783 prevailing winds repeatedly carried Laki’s sulfur-laden plume across the British Isles and mainland Europe.",
        "source_4": "Mount Asama in central Japan erupted explosively in August 1783 (the Tenmei eruption), emitting substantial sulfur; ice-core and modeling studies indicate its aerosols dispersed widely through the Northern Hemisphere, with some evidence of transport into the lower stratosphere.",
        "source_5": "Aerosols that reach the stratosphere can persist for many months and cause hemispheric-scale cooling and dimmed sunlight, whereas plumes confined to the lower troposphere are removed within days to weeks and mainly have regional effects.",
        "source_6": "European climate records show the strongest cold anomalies arriving in late 1783 and during the winter of 1783–1784, a timing consistent with cooling driven by a hemispherically dispersed volcanic aerosol veil after a late-summer eruption."

    "answer": "A major volcanic eruption released ash and sulfur gas into the atmosphere."
