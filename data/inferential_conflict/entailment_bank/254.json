    "question": "Compared to other communities, which locally available resource in desert communities is most likely to be depleted as population increases?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Deserts receive very little rainfall and have high evaporation rates, so naturally occurring freshwater (surface water and shallow groundwater) is scarce compared with more humid regions.",
        "source_2": "When a community’s population grows, total demand for essential resources like drinking water rises, increasing the risk of drawing down local supplies.",
        "source_3": "Many desert settlements tap nearby aquifers that recharge slowly; sustained pumping during population growth can exceed recharge and deplete those aquifers.",
        "source_4": "Numerous desert cities (e.g., in the American Southwest and the Middle East) import most of their potable water via canals, pipelines, or desalination, reducing reliance on strictly local freshwater sources.",
        "source_5": "Woody vegetation in arid landscapes grows slowly; harvesting nearby shrubs and trees for fuel or construction can outpace regrowth, rapidly depleting local biomass.",
        "source_6": "In dryland regions with limited access to electricity or gas, households commonly depend on locally collected firewood for cooking and heating, intensifying deforestation around settlements."
