    "question": "What can weathering cause to form in a boulder?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Weathering is the in-place breakdown of rock into smaller fragments or dissolved material through physical, chemical, or biological processes.",
        "source_2": "Freeze–thaw cycles, a type of mechanical weathering, can split a boulder into smaller pieces along existing cracks.",
        "source_3": "Breaking down a boulder from a larger whole into smaller pieces, without transporting the fragments, is a standard example of weathering in earth science.",
        "source_4": "In high-energy rivers and debris flows, boulders can fracture into smaller pieces from repeated collisions and grinding while they are moving; this is a form of fluvial erosion.",
        "source_5": "Clasts produced during transport often show percussion marks and fresh, unweathered fracture surfaces, indicating that breakage occurred during movement.",
        "source_6": "Fragmentation that happens during transport is attributed to erosional processes, whereas weathering describes breakdown that occurs in place."
