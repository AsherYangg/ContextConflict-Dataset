    "question": "If pumice forms when lava cools, what type of rock is pumice?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies.",
        "source_2": "Pumice forms when gas-rich volcanic lava is explosively ejected and rapidly cools, trapping bubbles and creating a highly vesicular rock.",
        "source_3": "Many sedimentary rocks (e.g., sandstones and some limestones) display abundant porosity, with numerous visible pore spaces between grains.",
        "source_4": "Pumice is extremely porous and low in density; fresh pieces often float on water because of their abundant vesicles.",
        "source_5": "In field identification, visible porosity is often used as a practical clue suggesting a sedimentary rock, whereas igneous rocks typically show dense, interlocking crystalline textures.",
        "source_6": "Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are transformed by heat and pressure without melting; they do not originate directly from cooled lava."

    "answer": "Igneous rock"
