    "question": "What event at convergent plate boundaries formed the Appalachian Mountains?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "At convergent plate boundaries, continent–continent collisions generate strong compressional stress that folds and thrusts rock layers, producing broad fold‑and‑thrust belts.",
        "source_2": "Such continent–continent collisions at convergent margins build high mountain ranges through crustal shortening, thickening, and uplift.",
        "source_3": "The Appalachian region preserves extensive Paleozoic fold‑and‑thrust belts and metamorphic cores, recording major compressional events (e.g., Taconic, Acadian, Alleghanian) in its structure and rock ages.",
        "source_4": "Intraplate hotspots (mantle plumes) can construct long chains of volcanic edifices and igneous intrusions as a plate moves over them, creating mountainous topography without plate convergence.",
        "source_5": "The White Mountain igneous province (New Hampshire) and the Monteregian Hills (Quebec) are Cretaceous intrusions/volcanic complexes commonly attributed to the New England–Great Meteor hotspot; offshore, the age‑progressive New England seamount chain continues this trend.",
        "source_6": "These hotspot‑related igneous complexes lie within the northern Appalachian region and locally contribute substantial relief, illustrating that volcanic construction can shape prominent uplands independent of collisional tectonics."

    "answer": "tectonic plates collided"
