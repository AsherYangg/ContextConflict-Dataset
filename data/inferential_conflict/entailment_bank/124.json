    "question": "Which quick process can create new land when lava cools after reaching the Earth's surface?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In 1963, the submarine eruption that created Surtsey off Iceland rapidly built a brand-new island above sea level within weeks, demonstrating that volcanic activity can quickly add new land at the ocean’s surface.",
        "source_2": "Coastal and submarine volcanic eruptions can rapidly pile up lava and ash; in some cases, vents breach the sea surface in days to months, forming new islands or extending shorelines near the ocean.",
        "source_3": "Large earthquakes can produce coseismic uplift that raises coastal seafloors and shorelines by meters in seconds, instantly exposing areas that were previously underwater and creating new land along the ocean.",
        "source_4": "Delta growth and beach progradation generally require long-term sediment accumulation over years to centuries; as a result, sediment deposition is typically a slow way to create new coastal land.",
        "source_5": "Major storms and tsunamis commonly erode or rearrange existing coastal sediments rather than create durable new land from the seafloor, so they are not a reliable quick source of net land gain.",
        "source_6": "Many submarine eruptions never build emergent land, and when new volcanic islands do appear, construction can require multiple eruptive episodes over extended periods before stabilizing."
