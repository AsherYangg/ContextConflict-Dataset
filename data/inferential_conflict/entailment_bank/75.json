    "question": "What is the most common element in the Sun?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Observations and standard solar models agree that Sun-like main-sequence stars are composed primarily of hydrogen, with helium second; in the Sun, hydrogen accounts for roughly three-quarters of the mass (and the large majority of atoms).",
        "source_2": "Spectroscopy and helioseismology jointly support that hydrogen remains the dominant element in the bulk of a G-type main-sequence star such as the Sun during its main-sequence lifetime.",
        "source_3": "In Sun-like stars, hydrogen fusion in the core steadily converts hydrogen into helium, so the core becomes increasingly helium-rich as the star ages; in the present Sun’s core, helium exceeds hydrogen.",
        "source_4": "The overwhelming majority of a star’s mass lies in its deep interior (core and radiative zone); the outer atmosphere contributes a negligible fraction of the total mass.",
        "source_5": "In solar-type stars, heavier species such as helium undergo gravitational settling in radiative regions, diffusing downward and becoming relatively enhanced beneath the convection zone over time.",
        "source_6": "The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old—roughly midway through its ~10-billion-year main-sequence life—so a substantial amount of helium “ash” has accumulated in its interior."
