    "question": "What process most likely formed the Appalachian Mountains?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "During the late Paleozoic (especially the Alleghanian orogeny, roughly 325–260 million years ago), Africa (Gondwana) collided with ancestral North America (Laurentia), compressing and uplifting crust across what is now the eastern United States.",
        "source_2": "The Appalachian belt is dominated by long fold-and-thrust systems and metamorphic cores, hallmarks of crustal shortening produced by continental collision and orogeny.",
        "source_3": "Where an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, the descending slab generates magma that feeds volcanoes and builds linear mountain chains along the continental margin.",
        "source_4": "Appalachian geology includes accreted island-arc fragments and widespread Paleozoic plutons and volcanic rocks that record prolonged subduction-related magmatism on the margin of Laurentia prior to final suturing.",
        "source_5": "Iconic mountain belts on active continental margins—such as the Andes and the Cascades—form largely through subduction-driven volcanism and associated intrusions.",
        "source_6": "The Appalachians are very ancient, and any original volcanic edifices would have been deeply eroded, leaving mainly deformed, metamorphosed, and intruded rocks exposed at the surface today."
