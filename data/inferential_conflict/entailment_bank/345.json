    "question": "What learned behavior do moose use to avoid fly bites?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Moose calves learn survival tactics by watching and following their mothers; young moose commonly copy adult choices of insect-shelter sites and protective behaviors.",
        "source_2": "In many large mammals, rolling in mud leaves a coating that acts as a physical barrier against biting flies and mosquitoes and can mask body odors that attract insects.",
        "source_3": "Within the deer family (cervids), species such as elk and red deer are documented to wallow in mud during peak fly season to lessen biting-fly harassment.",
        "source_4": "Summer biting flies impose heavy costs on moose—causing skin irritation, blood loss, and reduced foraging—so behaviors that cut down fly bites are protective for them.",
        "source_5": "In moose specifically, wallowing is best known as a rut behavior: adult bulls dig shallow “rut pits,” urinate in them, and wallow as a scent signal to attract females.",
        "source_6": "Field observations of moose in summer note anti-insect tactics such as standing in windy spots, seeking shade, and spending long periods wading or submerging in lakes and ponds, which reduces biting-fly attacks."
