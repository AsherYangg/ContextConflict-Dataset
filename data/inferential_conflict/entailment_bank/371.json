    "question": "What does a glacier do to rocks that helps make soil?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Glaciers abrade and grind the bedrock beneath them, producing abundant fine mineral particles known as rock flour.",
        "source_2": "The mineral component of soil—sand, silt, and clay—consists of small particles derived from weathered rock.",
        "source_3": "Actively flowing glaciers are powerful erosional agents that commonly strip away existing soils and regolith, leaving bare, scoured bedrock.",
        "source_4": "Soil can only form or accumulate where the rate of material production and retention from weathering exceeds the rate of removal by erosion and transport.",
        "source_5": "Meltwater streams and winds frequently carry glacial rock flour away and deposit it as loess, which develops into thick, highly fertile soils.",
        "source_6": "Beneath ice cover, low temperatures and lack of vegetation suppress chemical weathering and biological activity, processes essential for soil development."
    },
    "answer": "It scrapes small particles off large rocks."
