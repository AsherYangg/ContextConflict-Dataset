    "question": "What does finding coral fossils in Ohio indicate about Ohio’s past environment?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Many Paleozoic corals (such as tabulate and rugose corals) thrived in warm, shallow tropical seas; their fossils are commonly used to infer past warm marine conditions on continental interiors.",
        "source_2": "When marine fossils are preserved in the local bedrock of a region, it indicates that area was underwater when those rocks were deposited.",
        "source_3": "During the Pleistocene, the Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced over Ohio, transporting rocks and fossils southward and leaving widespread glacial till and erratics across the state.",
        "source_4": "Glacial tills and erratic boulders in the American Midwest frequently contain marine fossils, including corals, quarried from distant bedrock; fossils found in till are allochthonous (not formed in place).",
        "source_5": "Corals are not restricted to the tropics: azooxanthellate “cold‑water corals” live in cold, deep oceans today, and similar forms occur in the fossil record.",
        "source_6": "Fossils can be reworked and redeposited long after the organisms died, so a fossil’s findspot may reflect transport rather than the original habitat where it lived."

    "answer": "Ohio was once covered by warm seas."
