    "question": "What landform is formed when a melting glacier deposits piles of rocks?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Constructive forces build up Earth’s surface by deposition; glaciers create depositional landforms when they drop till and outwash, including moraines, drumlins, and eskers.",
        "source_2": "A moraine is a ridge or mound of unsorted glacial till deposited directly by a glacier along its sides or at its terminus (lateral and terminal moraines).",
        "source_3": "U-shaped valleys are classic glacial landforms produced when alpine glaciers erode and overdeepen preexisting V-shaped river valleys, creating broad, flat-floored troughs with steep sides.",
        "source_4": "Erosional processes can create distinct landforms by removing material (for example, valleys, canyons, and cirques), just as depositional processes create landforms by adding material.",
        "source_5": "Introductory Earth science texts commonly use moraines as the canonical example of a landform produced by the constructive (depositional) action of glaciers.",
        "source_6": "Constructive forces are often described as those that create new landforms or build up Earth’s surface."
