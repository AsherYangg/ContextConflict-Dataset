    "question": "What do weathering and erosion begin to form in the rock cycle?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In the rock cycle, the formation of sedimentary rock follows weathering and erosion: rocks are broken into sediment, then deposition, compaction, and cementation create sedimentary rock.",
        "source_2": "Weathering and erosion are geologic surface processes that act on existing rocks.",
        "source_3": "Many geology texts define the start of sedimentary rock formation at deposition—the point when transported sediment is laid down.",
        "source_4": "Weathering and erosion produce and transport loose particles but do not deposit them; deposition is the process that initiates the buildup of sediment layers.",
        "source_5": "Soil formation begins with the weathering of rock and the redistribution of material by erosion, together with accumulating organic matter.",
        "source_6": "Igneous rocks form by the cooling and solidification of magma or lava, not by weathering and erosion."
    },
    "answer": "sediments."
