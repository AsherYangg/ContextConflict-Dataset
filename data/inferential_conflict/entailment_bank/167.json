    "question": "After granite is weathered into sediment, then buried and compacted, what type of rock does it typically become?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Granite consists mostly of quartz and feldspar; chemical and physical weathering break it into sand-, silt-, and clay-sized particles, and feldspar-rich (arkosic) sands commonly lithify into sandstone when buried.",
        "source_2": "In the rock cycle, burial, compaction, and cementation of sediments lithify them into sedimentary rocks such as sandstone (from sand) or shale (from silt and clay).",
        "source_3": "In most sedimentary basins, burial to a few kilometers depth (with temperatures generally below about 200°C) leads to diagenesis—compaction and cementation—rather than metamorphism.",
        "source_4": "If sediments or sedimentary rocks are buried to greater depths or heated above roughly 200–250°C, they undergo low-grade metamorphism (for example, sandstone can recrystallize into quartzite and mudstone/shale into slate).",
        "source_5": "During mountain building, tectonic thickening can rapidly bury sedimentary successions to 10–20+ km, reaching pressures and temperatures sufficient to metamorphose them.",
        "source_6": "Compaction is an early burial process, but continued deep burial raises temperature and pressure, which can overprint diagenetic features and transform lithified sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks."

    "answer": "The granite becomes a new rock type."
