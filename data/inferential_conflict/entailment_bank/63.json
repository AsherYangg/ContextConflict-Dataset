    "question": "What causes the Moon to be visible from Earth?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The Moon’s phases occur because sunlight illuminates different portions of the lunar surface as seen from Earth.",
        "source_2": "The lunar regolith has a low but nonzero albedo (about 0.12), reflecting a measurable fraction of incident sunlight, including visible wavelengths.",
        "source_3": "Humans see an object when visible light from that object’s direction—whether emitted or reflected—enters the eye.",
        "source_4": "The Sun’s radiation at the Moon includes ultraviolet photons, and with essentially no lunar atmosphere, this UV reaches the surface.",
        "source_5": "Minerals present in lunar rocks (e.g., plagioclase feldspar in anorthositic crust) exhibit photoluminescence: when excited by ultraviolet light, they emit visible photons.",
        "source_6": "An object that emits its own visible photons can be seen even without relying on reflected light."

    "answer": "reflected sunlight"
