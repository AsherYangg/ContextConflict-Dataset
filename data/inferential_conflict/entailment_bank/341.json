    "question": "As a cold front passes into warm, moist air, what precipitation is likely to occur?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "When a fast-moving cold front pushes into warm, moist, unstable air, the denser cold air forces the warm air to rise rapidly, often producing cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms along the frontal boundary.",
        "source_2": "Thunderstorms are storms that generate precipitation—commonly heavy rain and sometimes hail—and are a frequent source of short-duration downpours.",
        "source_3": "Advection fog forms when warm, moist air flows over a colder surface (such as cold ocean water, snow-covered ground, or a shallow cold air mass) and cools to its dew point, producing widespread low cloud and reduced visibility.",
        "source_4": "A strong low-level temperature inversion stabilizes the atmosphere and suppresses deep convection; under such stable conditions, thunderstorm development is unlikely.",
        "source_5": "Rapid frontal lifting and marked instability favor deep convective storms, whereas gentle overrunning and cooling from below favor stratus or fog instead of thunderstorms.",
        "source_6": "Light winds over a cold surface help maintain a saturated, stable near-surface layer, sustaining fog and preventing the vigorous updrafts needed for thunderstorms."

    "answer": "Rain or snow begins to fall."
