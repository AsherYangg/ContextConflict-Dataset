    "question": "Can pesticides on crops harm people who eat the crops?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Pesticide applications can leave measurable residues on or in harvested crops; persistence varies by active ingredient, application rate, and time between spraying and harvest.",
        "source_2": "Several pesticide classes (e.g., organophosphates, carbamates) are toxic to mammals when ingested at sufficient doses, with documented adverse effects such as cholinesterase inhibition and neurological symptoms.",
        "source_3": "Diet is a primary route of pesticide exposure for the general population; humans and other animals commonly consume produce from treated crops.",
        "source_4": "Food-safety authorities (e.g., EPA, EFSA, Codex) set maximum residue limits and pre-harvest intervals so that residues on marketed produce remain below levels considered safe for consumers, including sensitive groups.",
        "source_5": "Large monitoring programs (USDA Pesticide Data Program; EFSA residue reports) consistently find that the vast majority of food samples have residues at or below legal limits, and estimated dietary exposures are typically well below toxicological reference values.",
        "source_6": "Routine food preparation steps—washing, peeling, and cooking—can substantially reduce surface pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables, further lowering consumer exposure."
