    "question": "Where is the tremendous pressure that forms diamonds generated?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Most natural diamonds originate deep in Earth’s mantle, generally at depths greater than about 140 km, where carbon is subjected to pressures of roughly 5–6 GPa and high temperatures before being brought to the surface by kimberlite or lamproite magmas.",
        "source_2": "Lithostatic pressure in the Earth increases with depth and is generated by the weight of the overlying rock column; at mantle depths of ~150 km it reaches several gigapascals, sufficient to stabilize diamond relative to graphite.",
        "source_3": "Geological investigations of large impact structures (such as the Popigai crater in Siberia) show that diamonds and lonsdaleite form during meteorite impacts via shock metamorphism, in which transient shock waves near the surface generate pressures of tens of gigapascals.",
        "source_4": "Laboratory shock-compression experiments demonstrate that graphite and other carbon sources can be converted to diamond by explosive or impact-driven shock waves, achieving the necessary pressures without deep burial or long-duration static load.",
        "source_5": "Petrologic evidence from diamond-bearing kimberlites indicates that the diamonds they carry predate the eruptions and were not created during ascent; they are mantle xenocrysts transported rapidly to the surface from great depth.",
        "source_6": "Impact-produced diamonds, including cubic diamond and lonsdaleite, are found within shocked rocks and ejecta at shallow crustal levels, confirming that hypervelocity impacts can generate the required pressures at or near Earth’s surface."

    "answer": "deep below the crust."
