    "question": "What human-caused change to the beach environment most likely leads to a decrease in sea turtle populations?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "As coastal populations grow, beachfront construction, artificial lighting, and heavy recreation typically reduce and disturb the sandy nesting habitat sea turtles need.",
        "source_2": "Sea turtles require dark, undisturbed beaches to nest successfully; when suitable nesting habitat shrinks, fewer hatchlings are produced and populations decline.",
        "source_3": "In many fast-growing beach communities, new residents have supported conservation rules—seasonal beach closures, protected nesting corridors, and “lights out” ordinances—that maintain or even expand usable nesting habitat despite more people living nearby.",
        "source_4": "Bycatch in offshore longline, trawl, and gillnet fisheries is a leading driver of sea turtle mortality and population decline, and it occurs far from beaches, largely independent of how many people reside on the coast.",
        "source_5": "Outbreaks of sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (a herpesvirus-linked disease) can sharply reduce juvenile survival and depress populations even where nesting beaches are intact.",
        "source_6": "Most sea turtle deaths occur at sea during foraging and migration rather than on nesting beaches, so population declines often reflect offshore threats more than beach crowding."
