    "question": "Where are metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist most likely to form: near the surface or deep underground?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Schist and gneiss are high-grade metamorphic rocks that typically form where rocks experience intense heat and strong pressure.",
        "source_2": "During continental collision, the crust thickens and regional metamorphism in the deep roots of mountain belts commonly produces high-grade rocks such as schist and gneiss.",
        "source_3": "In Earth’s crust, pressure and temperature generally increase with depth, so deeper levels experience greater heat and pressure than shallow levels.",
        "source_4": "Contact metamorphism occurs when country rock is heated by nearby magma bodies, often at relatively shallow crustal depths.",
        "source_5": "Large igneous intrusions (batholiths) can create extensive metamorphic aureoles in surrounding rocks that stretch for several kilometers.",
        "source_6": "Metamorphic rocks form when preexisting rocks are altered by heat, pressure, or chemically active fluids."

    "answer": "a site deep underground"
