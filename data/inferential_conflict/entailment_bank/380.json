    "question": "What action by a tree is an example of organic weathering of rocks?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Organic (biological) weathering occurs when living organisms such as plants, animals, or microbes cause rock to break down.",
        "source_2": "Plant roots can grow into pre‑existing fractures in rock and exert pressure that widens the cracks and can split off pieces of the rock.",
        "source_3": "A tree is a living organism.",
        "source_4": "In process-based classifications, root wedging is categorized as mechanical (physical) weathering because it fractures rock by force without altering mineral chemistry.",
        "source_5": "Lichens and some microbes secrete organic acids that chemically dissolve minerals at rock surfaces; many texts treat this biochemical action as the paradigmatic form of organic weathering."
