    "question": "When a hybrid car shuts off its gasoline engine at red lights and uses an electric motor, how does this most likely benefit people?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In hybrid cars that shut off the gasoline engine at stops and use an electric motor at low speeds, stop-and-go driving typically burns less gasoline than the same trip in a conventional gasoline-only car.",
        "source_2": "Burning less gasoline produces fewer combustion-related air pollutants (e.g., NOx, CO, hydrocarbons, particulates), improving urban air quality and public health.",
        "source_3": "The described vehicle is a plug-in hybrid and is routinely recharged from the local electricity grid.",
        "source_4": "In regions where most electricity is generated by coal-fired power plants, charging plug-in hybrids leads to higher overall (well-to-wheel) air-pollution emissions per mile than operating efficient gasoline-only cars.",
        "source_5": "The region where this car is operated relies predominantly on coal-fired power plants for electricity generation.",
        "source_6": "Well-to-wheel assessments count emissions from both electricity generation and on-road fuel combustion when evaluating a vehicle’s air-pollution impact."

    "answer": "uses less gasoline"
