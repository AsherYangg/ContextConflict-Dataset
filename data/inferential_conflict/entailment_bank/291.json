    "question": "What human activity is most likely the direct cause of the disappearance of large predatory fish like tuna from the oceans?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Multiple global assessments report that industrial fishing and overcapacity have been the primary direct drivers of the sharp worldwide decline in large predatory fish biomass since the mid‑20th century.",
        "source_2": "In fish ecology, “predatory fish” are simply fishes that prey upon other animals.",
        "source_3": "Tuna are large oceanic fishes that actively hunt and consume other fishes and squids.",
        "source_4": "Animals that hunt and kill other animals for food are classified as predators.",
        "source_5": "Over the past 50 years, the upper ocean has warmed and lost dissolved oxygen in many regions, reducing suitable thermal‑oxygen habitat for pelagic predators; such habitat loss can directly lower survival and recruitment in tunas and similar species.",
        "source_6": "Analyses that account for fishing mortality find that climate‑driven warming, deoxygenation, and shifting currents explain substantial variance in productivity, distribution, and abundance for several tuna and billfish populations, indicating direct demographic sensitivity to changing ocean conditions."

    "answer": "Commercial harvesting from the ocean"
