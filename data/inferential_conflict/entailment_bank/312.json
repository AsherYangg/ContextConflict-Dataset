    "question": "According to uniformitarianism, Earth’s landscapes form slowly over long periods; which event that quickly creates new land when lava cools is least consistent with this principle?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In its classic sense, geological uniformitarianism holds that most landforms arise from the same slow, gradual processes observable today acting over long spans of time, in contrast to singular, sudden catastrophes.",
        "source_2": "Large impact craters (e.g., Chicxulub) are produced by asteroid strikes that excavate basins within minutes to hours—a rapid, high‑energy event rather than a slow, incremental process.",
        "source_3": "Many river valleys and canyons are explained by long‑term fluvial erosion: rivers deepen and widen channels over millions of years, integrating countless small changes into major landforms.",
        "source_4": "Modern “actualism” interprets uniformitarianism as the uniformity of natural laws and kinds of processes, so both gradual and catastrophic processes observed today are invoked to explain ancient landscapes.",
        "source_5": "Asteroid impacts are empirically observed in the present (e.g., recorded airbursts and fresh craters) and leave diagnostic landforms, making impacts part of the accepted process set used by geologists.",
        "source_6": "Stratigraphic records show sediment accumulation is highly episodic—rates vary, event beds and hiatuses are common—so a perfectly steady, uninterrupted, constant‑rate buildup over millions of years is uncommon."
