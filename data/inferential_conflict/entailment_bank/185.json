    "question": "How do small particles form sedimentary rocks like shale and sandstone?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Sedimentary rocks commonly form when loose sediments accumulate in layers and are buried; over time, compaction and cementation lithify the sediments into rock.",
        "source_2": "Shale (from clay- and silt-sized particles) and sandstone (from sand-sized grains) are classic clastic sedimentary rocks.",
        "source_3": "Lithification involves compaction that squeezes out pore water and cementation that precipitates minerals (e.g., calcite or silica) to bind grains together.",
        "source_4": "Igneous rocks form by the cooling and crystallization of magma or lava; volcanic eruptions can deposit ash that later becomes volcanic tuff, a layered rock of consolidated volcanic particles.",
        "source_5": "Explosive volcanism produces sand-sized fragments and glass shards (tephra); hot, thick deposits can weld or solidify into coherent rock with little transport.",
        "source_6": "Quartz, abundant in many sands and sandstones, crystallizes from silica-rich magmas; volcanic ash can alter to clay minerals that are the main constituents of shale."

    "answer": "Particles are compressed into layers."
