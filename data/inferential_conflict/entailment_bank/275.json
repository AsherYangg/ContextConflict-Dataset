    "question": "What happens to animal habitats when many trees in a forest are cut down?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Forest canopies, tree cavities, and standing dead trees (snags) are critical nesting and shelter structures for many forest-dwelling animals.",
        "source_2": "Removing large numbers of trees from a forest eliminates much of that canopy and many cavity- or branch-based nesting sites.",
        "source_3": "When those tree-derived structures are lost, the amount of suitable habitat available to forest-dependent wildlife decreases.",
        "source_4": "Opening the canopy by cutting trees allows more light to reach the forest floor, which commonly triggers vigorous growth of shrubs and young trees.",
        "source_5": "Dense shrub and young-forest growth provides abundant cover and nesting opportunities for many animals, including deer, rabbits, and numerous early-successional songbirds.",
        "source_6": "Wildlife managers often use timber harvests (e.g., clearcuts or shelterwood cuts) specifically to create young-forest patches and increase available habitat for wildlife."
