    "question": "What does the discovery of dinosaur fossils in Antarctica imply about Antarctica’s past climate?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Antarctic Mesozoic rock layers preserve fossil forests, including in situ tree stumps and leaf beds, showing that parts of Antarctica supported dense, forested ecosystems during the age of dinosaurs.",
        "source_2": "Coal seams and abundant plant pollen/spores occur in Jurassic–Cretaceous strata of Antarctica, indicating high plant productivity and a climate far wetter and milder than the continent’s modern polar desert.",
        "source_3": "Multiple dinosaur lineages show feather-like insulation and bone histology consistent with elevated metabolic rates; high‑latitude sites (e.g., Alaska’s Prince Creek Formation and polar Australia) record year‑round dinosaur populations that overwintered under polar conditions rather than migrating.",
        "source_4": "Because of Earth’s axial tilt, regions at very high latitudes experience months of winter darkness; even during global greenhouse intervals, polar areas can have prolonged cold seasons with limited solar heating.",
        "source_5": "Today, Antarctica is the coldest and driest continent on Earth, with interior temperatures remaining well below freezing year‑round.",
        "source_6": "During much of the Cretaceous, the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent Gondwanan regions lay at very high southern latitudes, consistent with polar‑day/polar‑night light regimes and strong seasonal cycles."
    },
    "answer": "At some time in the past, Antarctica was much warmer and wetter."
