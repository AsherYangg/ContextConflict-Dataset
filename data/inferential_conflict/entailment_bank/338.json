    "question": "What provides the organic matter needed for most fertile soils?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Dead plant material—fallen leaves, stems, and roots—decomposes into humus, adding nutrients to the soil as it breaks down.",
        "source_2": "Humus formed from decayed vegetation is a major component of soil organic matter and directly supports soil fertility.",
        "source_3": "Soils with abundant humus/organic matter are typically the most fertile, with better nutrient supply and water-holding capacity.",
        "source_4": "Biomarker and isotope evidence shows that microbial necromass (e.g., amino-sugar–rich cell-wall residues) constitutes most of the stable soil organic carbon in many productive, fine-textured soils.",
        "source_5": "The stable fraction of soil organic matter is the part that most strongly governs long-term fertility through improved aggregation, moisture retention, and cation exchange capacity.",
        "source_6": "In fertile, well-aerated soils, recognizable plant litter turns over quickly; the organic matter that persists and accumulates is predominantly microbially derived."
