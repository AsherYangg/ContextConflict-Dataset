    "question": "If a wooded area is cleared to plant corn, what is most likely to happen to animal habitats?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Wooded areas provide structural complexity—trees, understory, and leaf litter—that supplies shelter, nesting sites, and microhabitats for many animals.",
        "source_2": "Clearing a wooded area removes the trees and understory, thereby eliminating many of those animal shelters and nesting sites in that location.",
        "source_3": "When forest is converted to cropland, populations of forest-dependent wildlife generally decline, and total terrestrial vertebrate abundance in the converted area is often lower than in intact forest.",
        "source_4": "Corn fields produce large amounts of accessible plant material and grain that attract generalist herbivores and omnivores (e.g., deer, rodents, raccoons, and some birds) and can increase their local populations.",
        "source_5": "Clearing a patch of forest creates edge habitat along the new field boundary; many generalist animals reach higher densities in edge zones where cover and food are adjacent.",
        "source_6": "In agricultural landscapes, a few generalist species frequently become very abundant; their numerical dominance can raise the total number of animals present even as specialist species decline."

    "answer": "Animal habitats will be destroyed."
