    "question": "What aspect of life on Earth do fossil discoveries of extinct dinosaurs help us learn more about?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Fossils are preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms; by analyzing their anatomy and the rocks they are found in, scientists reconstruct the history of life and past environments on Earth.",
        "source_2": "Paleontologists use fossil bones to infer an extinct animal’s age, diet, habitat, and ecology, yielding evidence about prehistoric ecosystems and how they changed over geologic time.",
        "source_3": "In 1971, Douglas A. Lawson discovered gigantic pterosaur bones (later named Quetzalcoatlus) in the Late Cretaceous Javelina Formation at Big Bend National Park, providing fossil evidence of a flying reptile from Earth’s deep past.",
        "source_4": "Bio‑inspired engineers study animal flight—including extinct forms such as pterosaurs—to extract aerodynamic principles that inform the design of modern drones and aircraft.",
        "source_5": "Aerospace teams, including NASA‑affiliated researchers, investigate bio‑inspired flight concepts for operation in low‑density atmospheres (e.g., Mars); the goal of this work is enabling future exploration and vehicle design rather than reconstructing Earth’s prehistoric environments.",
        "source_6": "Museums and school curricula regularly use dinosaur and pterosaur fossil discoveries to educate the public about Earth’s deep history and ancient ecosystems."
