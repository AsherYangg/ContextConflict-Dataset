    "question": "What season occurs in the Northern Hemisphere when it is tilted toward the Sun?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "On or around the June solstice (around June 21), the Northern Hemisphere is tilted maximally toward the Sun.",
        "source_2": "The hemisphere tilted toward the Sun experiences summer because its days are longer and sunlight arrives more directly.",
        "source_3": "Earth reaches perihelion—its closest approach to the Sun—around early January, which falls during Northern Hemisphere winter.",
        "source_4": "Because Earth is closer to the Sun at perihelion, the solar energy arriving at the top of Earth’s atmosphere is about 6–7% higher than at aphelion.",
        "source_5": "Early January is typically among the coldest periods across much of the Northern Hemisphere, characteristic of winter conditions.",
        "source_6": "Due to seasonal lag from land and ocean heat capacity, Northern Hemisphere temperatures usually peak in July–August, several weeks after the June solstice."
