        "source_3": "Some wildfires—especially smoldering peat fires—can burn continuously underground for months or even years.",
        "source_4": "In 2015, Indonesian peatland fires smoldered for several months, producing persistent transboundary haze until sustained rains arrived.",
        "source_5": "In fire ecology, peat fires are classified as wildfires occurring in organic-rich soils, i.e., they are a subtype of wildland fire.",
        "source_6": "The set of changes being compared includes earthquake, thunderstorm, wildfire, and drought."
