    "question": "What process breaks down large rocks into smaller pieces that become soil?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In climates where water repeatedly freezes and thaws near 0°C, freeze–thaw weathering widens cracks and progressively breaks large rocks into smaller pieces that can become soil.",
        "source_2": "The large rock is on a mid‑latitude mountain slope that experiences frequent springtime cycles of daytime melt and nighttime frost, providing repeated freeze–thaw conditions.",
        "source_3": "In warm, wet tropical environments, slightly acidic rainwater chemically weathers rock by dissolving minerals, producing clay‑rich soil over time.",
        "source_4": "The site is a lowland tropical rainforest with year‑round temperatures above 24°C, abundant rainfall, and no freezing conditions.",
        "source_5": "Earthquakes can abruptly fracture rock, but without ongoing weathering they do not by themselves convert rock into soil.",
        "source_6": "Wind abrasion grinds rock most effectively in arid, sparsely vegetated deserts; it is weak in humid forests and in snow‑covered alpine zones."
