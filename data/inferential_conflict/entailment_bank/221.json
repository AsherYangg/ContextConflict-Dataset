    "question": "If renewable resources can be used over again and water is a renewable resource, what can we infer about water?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Solar energy drives the global hydrologic cycle: evaporation and transpiration move water to the atmosphere, and precipitation returns it to land and oceans; over long periods the total amount of water on Earth is essentially constant, and precipitation continuously replenishes rivers, lakes, soils, and many aquifers.",
        "source_2": "Long-term global averages indicate that renewable freshwater generated by precipitation and runoff is about 43,000–45,000 km³ per year, while total human freshwater withdrawals are roughly 3,900–4,000 km³ per year, meaning the renewable flow of water exceeds current global use.",
        "source_3": "Satellite gravimetry (e.g., GRACE) and in situ records show sustained declines in many of the world’s major aquifer systems; estimates place global groundwater depletion on the order of 150–300 km³ per year, indicating extraction that outpaces natural recharge.",
        "source_4": "Deep “fossil” aquifers such as the Arabian Aquifer System, the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer, and parts of the Ogallala contain water recharged in past climatic eras; in arid regions modern recharge is negligible, so current withdrawals deplete stores that will not be replenished for thousands to tens of thousands of years.",
        "source_5": "In resource assessment, a resource is termed renewable when natural processes replenish it on timescales comparable to the rate of human consumption; persistent extraction that exceeds natural recharge constitutes non-renewable use.",
        "source_6": "Long-lived contamination and salinization can render freshwater sources unusable for decades or longer; pollutants such as nitrate, arsenic, and PFAS can persist and spread in aquifers, reducing available supplies even though the water remains within the hydrologic cycle."
