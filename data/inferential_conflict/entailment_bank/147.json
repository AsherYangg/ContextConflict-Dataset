    "question": "What does the fossil’s larger size and longer tusks than modern local elephants suggest about the species over time?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The African fossil record includes very large extinct elephants such as Palaeoloxodon recki, which often exceeded modern African elephants in body mass and carried exceptionally long, straight tusks; many specimens come from open savanna deposits of the Pliocene–Pleistocene.",
        "source_2": "During wetter “pluvial” phases of the late Quaternary, African savannas experienced higher primary productivity and supported greater herbivore biomass, conditions that can favor larger-bodied megaherbivores.",
        "source_3": "In African elephants, males are substantially larger than females, and tusk growth is continuous with age; old bulls can be far heavier and carry much longer tusks than typical individuals in living populations.",
        "source_4": "Fossil assemblages are biased toward large, robust elements, and fluvial processes can transport and redeposit bones far from where an animal actually lived or died, so single large finds may not represent the local, average fauna.",
        "source_5": "Heavy ivory poaching over the last two centuries has truncated age structures and selected for shorter tusks (and even tusklessness) in many elephant populations, making modern herds on average smaller-bodied and shorter-tusked than historical baselines.",
        "source_6": "Size and tusk length alone are unreliable for diagnosing elephant species; distinguishing extinct from extant taxa typically requires cranial and dental characters (for example, skull cresting and molar plate counts/enamel folding)."
    },
    "answer": "that physical changes occurred in elephants over time."
