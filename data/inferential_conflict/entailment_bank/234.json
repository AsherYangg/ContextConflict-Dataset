    "question": "What is the most likely effect on soil fertility of planting legumes to add nitrogen?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Legumes commonly form symbioses with rhizobia that fix atmospheric nitrogen in root nodules; when legume biomass is returned to the field, much of that fixed nitrogen contributes to soil fertility.",
        "source_2": "Increased nitrogen inputs and organic residues from legumes tend to improve soil quality metrics such as nutrient availability, aggregate stability, and biological activity, supporting better plant growth.",
        "source_3": "In many trials, cereal crops grown after a legume green manure or cover crop yield more than cereals after non-legumes, primarily because of the additional nitrogen supplied by the legume.",
        "source_4": "Where compatible rhizobia are absent and inoculants are not used, legumes nodulate poorly and fix little nitrogen, instead meeting their nitrogen demand by taking up and depleting soil mineral nitrogen.",
        "source_5": "High levels of plant-available nitrogen in soil suppress legume–rhizobia nitrogen fixation; under such conditions, legumes preferentially use soil nitrogen rather than adding new nitrogen to the system.",
        "source_6": "When a legume crop fails to fix nitrogen and removes soil nitrate, the subsequent nitrogen-demanding crop often experiences lower available nitrogen and reduced yield, reflecting a decline in soil fertility."

    "answer": "an enrichment in the fertility of the soil."
