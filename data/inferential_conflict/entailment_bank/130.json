    "question": "Which fossils found in the same area can be used to determine the approximate age of the dinosaur bones?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Dinosaur bones preserved in rock are fossils.",
        "source_2": "Geologists often estimate a fossil’s age from the age of the sedimentary rock layer that contains it, using the law of superposition and correlation with dated layers (such as interbedded volcanic ash or index fossils).",
        "source_3": "Sedimentary rocks form in layers; when undisturbed, lower layers are older than the layers above them.",
        "source_4": "Dinosaur skeletal remains are typically preserved as fossils within sedimentary rock strata.",
        "source_5": "Field documentation for this find reports that the bones were recovered from a reworked river-gravel deposit that mixes fossils eroded from multiple, much older formations; in such reworked deposits, the enclosing sediment’s age does not reflect the fossils’ original age.",
        "source_6": "Geochemical fingerprinting of fossil bone (for example, rare-earth element patterns or strontium isotope ratios in bone apatite) can link a specimen to a specific, independently dated source formation, allowing an approximate age to be inferred even when the present stratigraphic context is misleading."
