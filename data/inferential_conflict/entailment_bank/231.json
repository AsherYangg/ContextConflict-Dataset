    "question": "What aspect of soil is negatively affected by overproduction of corn?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Continuous corn monoculture, especially without rotation or adequate nutrient replacement, depletes soil nutrients and soil organic matter over time, reducing soil fertility.",
        "source_2": "Harvesting and removing corn stover for bioenergy reduces residue cover and soil organic carbon and increases erosion risk, which lowers soil fertility unless removal is limited and mitigations are applied.",
        "source_3": "The mid-2000s to early-2010s expansion of U.S. corn-for-ethanol demand contributed to more continuous-corn acreage and stimulated stover-harvest programs and trials, linking high corn output to practices that strain soil fertility.",
        "source_4": "Corn is a high-residue crop; when residues are retained and combined with no-till or cover crops, they increase soil organic matter and improve nutrient cycling, thereby improving soil fertility.",
        "source_5": "Conservation tillage is widely used on U.S. corn acres and cover crop adoption has been rising, practices that retain residues and reduce erosion relative to conventional tillage.",
        "source_6": "Increases in soil organic matter enhance soil fertility and soil health by improving soil structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient availability, benefiting ecosystem function."

    "answer": "decreasing soil fertility"
