    "question": "What natural process, caused by repeated freezing and thawing of water in rock cracks, most likely produced the small rock pieces on the Maine trail?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In Maine’s mountains, temperatures commonly oscillate around 0°C in fall and spring; repeated freezing and thawing of water in rock cracks (frost wedging) is a dominant form of mechanical weathering that breaks bedrock into small, angular fragments.",
        "source_2": "Where a trail cuts across exposed, in-place bedrock, loose chips on the tread often originate directly from that adjacent rock as mechanical weathering spalls off pieces, leaving fragments that match the local bedrock in composition and color.",
        "source_3": "Northeastern U.S. trail crews, including in Maine, routinely harden eroding or steep trail sections by importing and spreading crushed quarry stone or gravel over the path to improve drainage and footing.",
        "source_4": "Imported trail gravel is typically a relatively uniform layer of similarly sized, angular chips and may be a rock type that differs from nearby bedrock; such material indicates the pieces were produced by industrial crushing, not on-site natural weathering.",
        "source_5": "Frost-shattered debris in cold, wet mountain climates is characteristically irregular in size and accumulates near joints and outcrops, a field signature of active freeze–thaw breakdown along exposed ridgelines and slopes.",
        "source_6": "After maintenance or post-storm repairs, popular Maine trails often show fresh layers of small stone fragments across the tread even during warm, nonfreezing seasons, reflecting recent human placement rather than in-situ rock breakdown."
