    "question": "If a wildfire removes nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from the soil, what happens to the soil’s carrying capacity for plant growth until the nutrients are replenished?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In May 2007, wildfires burned more than 350 square miles of habitat in Florida and Georgia, including pine flatwoods and swamp ecosystems.",
        "source_2": "High‑intensity wildfire can volatilize nitrogen and remove phosphorus and potassium through ash loss and erosion, temporarily lowering soil nutrient availability.",
        "source_3": "Plant growth is limited by the availability of macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; when these are scarce in soil, primary productivity declines.",
        "source_4": "Forest‑fire ash is rich in readily soluble phosphorus and potassium; when rains follow, these nutrients are rapidly leached into surface soils, often creating a short‑term fertility pulse that stimulates plant growth.",
        "source_5": "Many southeastern U.S. fire‑adapted species (e.g., wiregrass and saw palmetto) resprout vigorously after burns and capitalize on increased light and transient nutrient pulses to show rapid postfire regrowth.",
        "source_6": "In early June 2007, Tropical Storm Barry brought widespread rains to north Florida and south Georgia shortly after the May fires, wetting burned areas and mobilizing ash and deposited nitrogen compounds."
    },
    "answer": "The carrying capacity of the soil for plant growth is reduced."
