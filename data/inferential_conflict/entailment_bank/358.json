    "question": "How does weathering by wind and water make rocks smooth and rounded?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "In rivers and surf zones, repeated collisions, rolling, and grinding abrade protruding corners and polish surfaces; laboratory tumbling and flume experiments show that longer transport durations produce smoother, more rounded clasts through mechanical abrasion and attrition.",
        "source_2": "Many field surveys report systematic increases in pebble roundness and surface polish downstream and on wave‑worked beaches, with the most rounded clasts typically occurring where cumulative transport and reworking have been greatest.",
        "source_3": "Spheroidal weathering rounds rocks in place: chemical dissolution and exfoliation attack edges and corners faster than flat faces, producing smooth, rounded “corestones” within a saprolite profile without any need for physical transport.",
        "source_4": "Landscapes with tors and exhumed corestones (e.g., in granitic or basaltic terrains) commonly display rounded boulders sitting directly on their parent bedrock; their smooth, rounded shapes formed in situ prior to any significant fluvial or coastal movement.",
        "source_5": "Rock type strongly controls rounding rates: hard, tough lithologies (e.g., quartzite) resist abrasion and can remain angular after substantial movement, whereas chemically reactive rocks (e.g., limestone) can become smoother and rounder rapidly via dissolution or mild reworking.",
        "source_6": "Glacial transport often produces faceted, striated, and relatively angular clasts; despite potentially long travel within ice, many glacial tills contain poorly rounded fragments, showing that transport does not invariably yield smooth, rounded shapes."

    "answer": "They were smoothed by the action of wind and water."
