    "question": "What interaction between continental land masses and solar energy causes the Earth to warm up?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Under direct sunlight, continental land surfaces absorb a significant fraction of incoming solar radiation and convert it to heat within the ground and near‑surface air.",
        "source_2": "When any component of a larger system gains thermal energy, the total thermal energy of that system increases.",
        "source_3": "Continents are integral parts of the Earth system.",
        "source_4": "Over continents, strong surface heating often triggers deep convective clouds with high albedo that reflect large amounts of incoming sunlight back to space.",
        "source_5": "Reflecting more sunlight back to space reduces the amount of solar energy retained by the Earth system.",
        "source_6": "The oceans absorb most of the solar energy that reaches Earth’s surface because they cover most of the planet and water has a high heat capacity."

    "answer": "absorption of solar energy by continental land masses"
