    "question": "When a tree’s roots grow into a crack in a boulder and widen it, what process is occurring?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The students observed a large crack in a boulder with a tree growing out of it.",
        "source_2": "As tree roots thicken, their radial growth can generate enough pressure to wedge open rock fractures and split blocks; this root wedging is a form of mechanical (physical/biological) weathering.",
        "source_3": "Fresh, angular rock spalls and tiny side fractures were present where the roots pressed against the crack walls, indicating ongoing widening at the root–rock contact.",
        "source_4": "The main fracture curved parallel to the boulder’s outer surface and continued as a smooth, sheet-like crack around portions of the boulder where no roots were present.",
        "source_5": "In massive granitic boulders, unloading and thermal expansion produce exfoliation (sheeting) joints—surface-parallel cracks that predate vegetation; plants commonly colonize these joints without having created them.",
        "source_6": "Trees often germinate in existing cracks because moisture and soil accumulate there; the presence of a tree in a fracture does not, by itself, prove that roots caused the crack."
