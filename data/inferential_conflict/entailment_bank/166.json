    "question": "In the hydrosphere, where do organic rocks most commonly form?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, and the global ocean contains roughly 97% of all Earth’s water by volume.",
        "source_2": "The hydrosphere includes all of Earth’s water reservoirs: oceans and seas, lakes and rivers, groundwater and ice, as well as surface wetlands such as swamps and bogs.",
        "source_3": "In the geologic record, most sedimentary organic carbon is preserved as kerogen within organic-rich marine shales deposited under anoxic conditions on continental shelves and in ocean basins.",
        "source_4": "Coal forms from thick accumulations of peat in waterlogged, oxygen-poor swamps and bogs; with burial and heating, peat is transformed into lignite and bituminous coal.",
        "source_5": "Coal is the principal sedimentary rock composed predominantly of organic matter, typically containing more than 50% organic carbon by weight.",
        "source_6": "Wetlands (including swamps and bogs) are components of the hydrosphere characterized by standing or saturated water that slows decomposition and promotes the accumulation of plant material."
