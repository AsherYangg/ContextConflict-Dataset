    "question": "Do nonrenewable resources take millions of years to form?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas originate from ancient organic matter that is buried and transformed by heat and pressure over geologic timescales, typically millions of years.",
        "source_2": "Many major hydrocarbon and coal deposits are associated with Paleozoic–Mesozoic strata; Carboniferous coal beds (~300 million years old) and Mesozoic source rocks show that their formation and maturation occurred tens to hundreds of millions of years ago.",
        "source_3": "Processes measured in millions of years are considered geologic timescales and are vastly longer than human lifetimes.",
        "source_4": "Metallic mineral ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead) are classified as nonrenewable natural resources because geological processes do not replenish mineable ore bodies on human timescales.",
        "source_5": "Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits at seafloor hydrothermal systems can accumulate rapidly; hydrothermal venting builds meter-scale sulfide chimneys in years to decades, and geochronology indicates that substantial portions of some VMS ore bodies formed over only thousands to tens of thousands of years.",
        "source_6": "Thousands of years is orders of magnitude shorter than millions of years (e.g., 10,000 years is 1% of a million years)."

    "answer": "They can take millions of years to form."
