    "question": "To become rock, sediments must generally be what?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Clastic sedimentary rocks (shales, siltstones, sandstones) are the most abundant sedimentary rock types by volume in the geologic record.",
        "source_2": "Lithification of clastic sediments typically involves burial compaction—overlying weight squeezes grains together and expels pore water—often followed by mineral cementation.",
        "source_3": "In many shallow‑marine carbonate settings, sediments can lithify rapidly through early cementation at or just below the seafloor, before substantial burial occurs.",
        "source_4": "Early carbonate cementation rigidifies the sediment framework and largely inhibits later mechanical compaction during burial.",
        "source_5": "Long intervals in numerous basins are dominated by thick carbonate platform successions (limestone and dolostone)."
    },
    "answer": "compacted."
