    "question": "What has replaced the fields that were the snowshoe hare’s habitat in Maryland?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Snowshoe hares rely on old fields and brushy, early-successional habitat for cover and feeding; in Maryland they occupied such open, high-elevation habitats.",
        "source_2": "In the late 1970s and early 1980s, many former fields in western Maryland were converted into housing developments and associated roads.",
        "source_3": "When an open field is replaced by a housing development, animal species that depend on that field’s habitat are no longer found at that site.",
        "source_4": "By 1986, biologists surveying known localities reported that snowshoe hares were no longer found anywhere in Maryland.",
        "source_5": "The last documented snowshoe hare groups in Maryland were within a state forest that retained its early-successional openings and experienced no residential development before 1990.",
        "source_6": "In spring 1985, field biologists recorded a tick-borne disease outbreak in that state forest that caused a sudden, near-total die-off of snowshoe hares despite no change in land use during that period."

    "answer": "Housing developments have replaced fields."
