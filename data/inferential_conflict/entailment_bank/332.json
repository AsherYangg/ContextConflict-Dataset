    "question": "Which organism that creates tunnels in soil should Michelle add to increase water and air penetration?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Michelle wants more water and air to penetrate the soil in her yard.",
        "source_2": "Earthworms tunnel through soil and create burrows.",
        "source_3": "Soil burrows and channels increase aeration and allow more water to infiltrate.",
        "source_4": "Some gardeners introduce earthworms to compacted garden beds to loosen the soil by their tunneling.",
        "source_5": "Michelle’s yard includes a native woodland patch in a previously glaciated northern region; land‑grant extensions warn that introducing non‑native earthworms in such ecosystems depletes leaf litter and alters soil structure, and they advise against releasing earthworms there.",
        "source_6": "When avoiding fauna introductions, incorporating abundant coarse mineral amendment (e.g., coarse sand or fine gravel) increases soil macroporosity and improves air and water movement in compacted soils."
