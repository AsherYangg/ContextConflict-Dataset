    "question": "What resource supplies plants with the minerals they need to grow?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "[Plants require mineral nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to grow and complete their life cycles.]",
        "source_2": "[Soils contain and supply mineral nutrients to plants, derived from weathered rock and decomposed organic matter.]",
        "source_3": "[In terrestrial environments, soil is the primary reservoir from which plants obtain mineral nutrients.]",
        "source_4": "[Plant roots take up mineral nutrients only as dissolved ions from the soil solution—the water in soil pore spaces—rather than from solid soil particles.]",
        "source_5": "[Water acts as the solvent and carrier that transports dissolved mineral ions into roots and upward through the plant via the xylem.]",
        "source_6": "[Mineral nutrients bound to soil particles must first dissolve into the soil water before plants can absorb them.]"
