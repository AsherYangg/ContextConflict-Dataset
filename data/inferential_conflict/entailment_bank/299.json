    "question": "By recycling over 35% of its waste, how does Maryland affect the amount of trash it sends to landfills?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Maryland’s Department of the Environment reported that in 2004 the state achieved an MRA recycling rate above 35% (approximately 39%), diverting a substantial share of municipal solid waste from disposal.",
        "source_2": "When material is recycled instead of landfilled, local governments avoid landfill tipping fees and long‑term landfill management liabilities; in the Mid‑Atlantic, landfill tipping fees are typically significant (often tens of dollars per ton), so diversion can translate into direct cost savings.",
        "source_3": "Recyclable commodities such as aluminum cans and corrugated cardboard have positive market value, and in the mid‑2000s many municipalities offset recycling program costs by selling these materials.",
        "source_4": "Curbside recycling requires separate collection routes, transfer, and sorting at materials recovery facilities; studies in the early 2000s documented that in numerous U.S. cities the per‑ton cost of recycling collection and processing exceeded the per‑ton cost of landfilling.",
        "source_5": "Secondary materials markets are volatile; low‑value streams like mixed glass and some grades of mixed paper often bring little or no revenue, and contamination produces residuals that still must be landfilled, adding disposal costs to recycling programs.",
        "source_6": "Background: In the mid‑2000s Maryland also used waste‑to‑energy facilities and exported some waste to out‑of‑state landfills under disposal contracts, factors that influence the financial comparison between recycling and disposal without by themselves determining the net cost or savings."
