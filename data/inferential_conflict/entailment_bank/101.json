    "question": "What natural event occurs monthly due to the Moon’s orbit around Earth?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "The Moon’s phase cycle (the synodic month) averages about 29.53 days, and the dates of new moons, full moons, and quarter phases can be calculated accurately centuries in advance.",
        "source_2": "In Earth science education, cyclic changes are commonly categorized as daily (Earth’s rotation causing day/night), monthly (the repeating sequence of lunar phases), and yearly (Earth’s revolution causing seasons).",
        "source_3": "Gregorian calendar months have unequal lengths (28–31 days), and because 29.53 days does not divide evenly into them, some calendar months—especially February—occasionally contain no full moon while others contain two.",
        "source_4": "February 2018 contained no full moon, whereas both January 2018 and March 2018 each contained two full moons (“blue moons”), showing that a full moon does not occur in every calendar month.",
        "source_5": "Ocean tides are modulated by the lunar cycle: spring tides occur near new and full moon and neap tides near first and last quarter, yielding a predictable roughly two-week spring–neap rhythm tied to lunar phases.",
        "source_6": "Many natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) are not periodic and cannot be forecast to recur on a fixed monthly timetable."
