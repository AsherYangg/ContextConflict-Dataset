    "question": "One process in forming sedimentary rocks occurs when rocks are what and then deposited how?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Physical and chemical weathering break existing rock into smaller fragments (sediment); moving water, wind, or ice then transports and deposits that sediment.",
        "source_2": "Deposited sediment commonly accumulates in distinct layers (beds), and with burial it becomes lithified—compacted and cemented into sedimentary rock.",
        "source_3": "Standard models of sedimentary rock formation explicitly list weathering and deposition as stages in the process that produces sedimentary rocks.",
        "source_4": "Igneous (volcanic) rocks form when molten magma or lava cools and solidifies; fragments of these igneous rocks often supply the sand and gravel that make up sediments.",
        "source_5": "Provenance studies show that, for many sedimentary rocks, the grains they contain originated in igneous processes—produced by melting and cooling in magma or eruptive materials before becoming sediment.",
        "source_6": "Some chemical sediments (for example, rock salt or certain limestones) can precipitate directly from solution and may form thick, massive bodies with little obvious layering."
    },
    "answer": "broken up and deposited in layers."
