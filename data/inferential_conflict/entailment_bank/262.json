    "question": "Would placing animal feeders by the road help protect deer from cars?",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Wildlife feeders placed beside a road attract deer to that roadside location.",
        "source_2": "Deer lingering near or crossing a roadway have a higher chance of being struck by vehicles than deer that stay away from roads.",
        "source_3": "A measure that increases the chance of a deer being struck by a car is not protecting that deer from cars.",
        "source_4": "Lower speed limits and prominent wildlife-warning signs reduce wildlife–vehicle collisions in places where animals predictably gather near roads.",
        "source_5": "Creating a designated deer feeding area by the road can concentrate deer activity in a predictable location, allowing road managers to post warnings and enforce slow speeds through that segment.",
        "source_6": "Concentrating animal activity and slowing traffic at a well-marked point helps protect deer compared with many unmarked, higher-speed crossings spread along the road."
