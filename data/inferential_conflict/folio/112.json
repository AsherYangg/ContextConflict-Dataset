        "source_3": "He played as a halfback and as an inside left.",
        "source_4": "He scored the winning goal in the 1913 FA Cup Final.",
        "source_5": "Being the 1913 FA Cup Final match-winner for Aston Villa suggests he was a key player then, making an immediate transfer away less likely.",
