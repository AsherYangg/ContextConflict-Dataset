    "question": "Based on the given evidence, is the hypothesis 'Ron is either both a penguin and endothermic, or he is nether.' true, false, or uncertain? The final answer should be 'True', 'False', or 'Uncertain'. Only answer 'Uncertain' if the reasoning results from different evidences conflict with each other.",
