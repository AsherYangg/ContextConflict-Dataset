    "question": "Based on the given evidence, is the hypothesis 'If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.' true, false, or uncertain? The final answer should be 'True', 'False', or 'Uncertain'. Only answer 'Uncertain' if the reasoning results from different evidences conflict with each other.",
