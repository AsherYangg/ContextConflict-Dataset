    "question": "Based on the given evidence, is the hypothesis 'P value represents the selection intensity for somatic variants in cancer cell lineages.' true, false, or uncertain? The final answer should be 'True', 'False', or 'Uncertain'. Only answer 'Uncertain' if the reasoning results from different evidences conflict with each other.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "A central goal in cancer biology is to find genetic alterations that give cancer cells a selective fitness advantage.",
        "source_2": "Cancer researchers often rank the importance of substitutions to tumor growth using their P values.",
        "source_3": "P values indicate statistical significance and are not measures of effect size.",
        "source_4": "In large, well-controlled genomic cohorts, mutations under stronger positive selection tend to recur more frequently, producing smaller P values.",
        "source_5": "With accurate background mutation models, deviations from expectation that yield low P values can monotonically track underlying selection intensity across sites."

    "answer": "False"
