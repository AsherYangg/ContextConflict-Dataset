    "question": "Based on the given evidence, is the hypothesis 'Cancer effect size is preferred by cancer researchers.' true, false, or uncertain? The final answer should be 'True', 'False', or 'Uncertain'. Only answer 'Uncertain' if the reasoning results from different evidences conflict with each other.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Cancer biology seeks genetic alterations that give cancer cells a selective advantage.",
        "source_2": "Cancer researchers often rank the importance of substitutions for cancer growth by their P-values.",
        "source_3": "P-values serve as thresholds for belief rather than measures of effect size.",
        "source_4": "Some cancer researchers advocate prioritizing estimated effect size when evaluating mutations.",
        "source_5": "In some datasets, substitutions with very low P-values also exhibit large effects, allowing P-values to act as a rough proxy for effect size."

    "answer": "False"
