        "source_4": "Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus.",
        "source_5": "The person who finds a fossil is not necessarily the one who formally establishes a new genus in a scientific publication.",
        "source_6": "Some later taxonomic assessments may treat Ambiortus as not a distinct, valid genus (e.g., as a synonym), challenging its status as a new genus."
