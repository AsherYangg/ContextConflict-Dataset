    "question": "Based on the given evidence, is the hypothesis 'PSO J318.5−22 is an orphan planet.' true, false, or uncertain? The final answer should be 'True', 'False', or 'Uncertain'. Only answer 'Uncertain' if the reasoning results from different evidences conflict with each other.",
    "content": {
        "source_1": "Every object is either inside the solar system or outside it.",
        "source_2": "No object outside the solar system has the Sun as its star.",
        "source_3": "Every object in the solar system is gravitationally bound to the Sun.",
        "source_4": "No planet that is gravitationally bound to the Sun is a rogue planet.",
        "source_5": "All orphan planets are rogue planets.",
        "source_6": "If PSO J318.5−22 is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound to the Sun, then PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet.",
        "source_7": "PSO J318.5−22 has no detected host star, consistent with being an orphan planet.",
        "source_8": "PSO J318.5−22 has been reported within the Sun’s gravitational sphere of influence, implying it is bound to the Sun."
