    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. What is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks’ gestation presented in active labor with severe pelvic pain; her pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes, her prior pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, and she was taking insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. On admission, vital signs were within normal limits, the cervix was 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated, the vertex was at −1 station, and the fetal heart rate was reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia was performed with symptomatic improvement; ten minutes later she developed dizziness with pulse 68/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, prompting initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation. Using a Bayesian framework anchored to the known and common occurrence of hypotension after epidural anesthesia in laboring patients, a hypothetical prior probability was set at 50%. The near-immediate temporal association between neuraxial administration and symptom onset increased the posterior estimate to approximately 70%. Objective confirmation of hypotension without alternative explanatory features further raised the probability to 85%. The prompt initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation, consistent with standard management of neuraxial-associated hypotension, supported this inference and increased the estimated probability to about 95%. The constellation of timing, vitals, and clinical response makes the epidural the most likely precipitant of the hypotensive episode; therefore, the most likely underlying cause is epidural anesthesia.",
        "source_2": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks’ gestation in active labor with severe pelvic pain and gestational diabetes (prior pregnancy and delivery uncomplicated; medications: insulin, folic acid, multivitamin) had normal baseline vital signs, a cervix 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated, vertex at −1 station, and a reactive fetal heart rate without decelerations. After epidural anesthesia—followed by symptomatic improvement—she developed dizziness ten minutes later with pulse 68/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, leading to intravenous fluid resuscitation. The differential diagnosis for acute intrapartum hypotension in this context includes hypovolemia secondary to blood loss, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, vasovagal syncope, amniotic fluid embolism, and epidural-induced hypotension. Significant hemorrhage or dissection would more typically produce marked vital sign instability and overt shock, which are not described. Vasovagal syncope usually causes bradycardia and hypotension; however, the temporal pattern in this case does not support that diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism is commonly accompanied by chest pain and/or dyspnea, which are absent. Amniotic fluid embolism generally presents with sudden cardiovascular collapse and is rare, often featuring seizures or cardiac arrest, findings not present here. In contrast, the immediate onset of dizziness and documented hypotension shortly after neuraxial administration, together with the standard management response, is most consistent with a common neuraxial side effect due to sympathetic nerve blockade causing vasodilation and reduced systemic vascular resistance. The most likely underlying cause is epidural-induced hypotension."
