    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7В°C (98.1В°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "In a 49-year-old man with a 6-week history of multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness, absent personal or family history of serious illness, and occupational exposure as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents, the neurologic phenotype localizes to the cerebellum: he is alert and oriented to time, place, and person; vital signs are stable (temperature 36.7В°C [98.1В°F], pulse 88/min, blood pressure 108/70 mm Hg); examination demonstrates a wide-based gait; inability to stand with feet together without support; a coarse tremor of the hands elicited when asked to grab a pen (intention tremor); and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands (dysdiadochokinesia), with normal muscle strength and tone in all extremities, intact bilateral sensation to pain, vibration, and position, and no abnormalities on mental status examination. The combination of truncal and appendicular ataxia with intention tremor and dysdiadochokinesia, in the absence of sensory loss or weakness, is characteristic of cerebellar system dysfunction and argues against vestibular, proprioceptive (dorsal column), or pyramidal etiologies; the subacute course over 6 weeks and the absence of focal cortical signs further support a degenerative cerebellar process. The most likely diagnosis is cerebellar degeneration.",
        "source_2": "The same patient’s daily intake of one pint of rum provides a specific etiologic framework for the observed cerebellar syndrome: chronic ethanol exposure is well documented to produce preferential injury to cerebellar circuitry—particularly vermis-predominant degeneration—manifesting as gait instability with a wide-based gait, inability to maintain stance with feet together without support, intention tremor (coarse tremor of the hands when attempting a goal-directed task such as grabbing a pen), and impaired rapid alternating movements, while sparing strength, tone, and peripheral sensory modalities (pain, vibration, position), and leaving mental status examination normal. In this 49-year-old man with multiple falls and episodes of dizziness over 6 weeks, normal vital signs (temperature 36.7В°C [98.1В°F], pulse 88/min, blood pressure 108/70 mm Hg), intact orientation to time, place, and person, and occupational exposure that is noted but not explanatory, the constellation of findings is most parsimoniously attributed to ethanol-induced neurotoxicity of the cerebellum. The most likely diagnosis is alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration."
