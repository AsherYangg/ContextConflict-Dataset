    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "In a previously healthy 19-year-old man with 12 hours of right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain and a 3-day history of a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency, the differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain includes testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted infection, and kidney stone. Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the right testicle is tender, and pain improves with elevation (Prehn’s sign), while the penis appears normal with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a normal complete blood count and urinalysis with 3 WBC/hpf; a Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound reveals increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. The combination of relief with elevation and Doppler hyperemia favors an inflammatory process of the epididymis/testis over testicular torsion, which typically shows diminished perfusion, while the absence of organisms on urethral Gram stain does not exclude sexually transmitted pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Taken together with the patient’s sexual activity without condom use, these findings most consistently indicate an infectious epididymal process as the cause of the acute scrotum. Epididymitis.",
        "source_2": "The clinical constellation in this 19-year-old man—right-sided testicular pain of 12 hours’ duration relieved by elevation (Prehn’s sign), 3 days of dysuria and increased urinary frequency, normal vital signs, absence of urethral discharge with a normal-appearing penis at the meatus, a normal complete blood count, urinalysis showing 3 WBC/hpf, a urethral swab Gram stain demonstrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms, and testicular ultrasound showing increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left—is most consistent with infectious epididymitis. In sexually active young men who do not use condoms, sexually transmitted etiologies predominate; gonorrhea and chlamydia are common causes of sexually transmitted epididymitis in this demographic. The Gram stain profile of polymorphonuclear leukocytes without identifiable organisms supports a non-gonococcal urethritis pattern, making a nongonococcal sexually transmitted pathogen the leading consideration; within this context, the most likely causative organism is Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydia trachomatis."
