    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38В°C (100.4В°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin count 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,400/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 56%\nEosinophils 11%\nLymphocytes 31%\nMonocytes 2%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 4.2 mg/dL\nRenal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\". If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "Two weeks after undergoing emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man developed decreased urinary output and malaise in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips; prior medications included insulin and naproxen, and he was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. Vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 93/min, and blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg, and examination revealed mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin count 14 g/dL; leukocyte count 16,400/mm3 with segmented neutrophils 56%, eosinophils 11%, lymphocytes 31%, monocytes 2%; platelet count 260,000/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h; serum urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL; creatinine 4.2 mg/dL. Renal biopsy demonstrated intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, a histopathologic pattern consistent with cholesterol crystal embolization. The temporal association with an invasive vascular procedure, the cutaneous findings, the eosinophilia with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the acute kidney injury collectively indicate a post-procedural showering of cholesterol crystals from disrupted atheromatous plaque with ensuing multisystem microvascular injury. The most likely diagnosis is cholesterol embolization syndrome.",
        "source_2": "A 61-year-old man presented with decreased urinary output and malaise two weeks after emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris; his comorbidities included type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips, and his medications transitioned from insulin and naproxen prior to admission to aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the intervention. He was febrile to 38°C (100.4°F) with a pulse of 93/min and blood pressure of 125/85 mm Hg, and examination identified mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory evaluation was notable for hemoglobin count 14 g/dL; leukocyte count 16,400/mm3 with segmented neutrophils 56%, eosinophils 11%, lymphocytes 31%, monocytes 2%; platelet count 260,000/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h; serum urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL; creatinine 4.2 mg/dL. The renal biopsy demonstrated intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, a finding indicative of cholesterol emboli lodging within small renal arteries. The post-catheterization timing, acute kidney injury with reduced urine output and creatinine elevation, eosinophilia and heightened erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and coexistent skin findings consistent with livedo reticularis support embolization of cholesterol crystals to the renal vasculature as the proximate cause of renal dysfunction. The most likely diagnosis is atheroembolic renal disease.",
        "source_3": "Following emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man developed decreased urinary output and malaise over a two-week interval; he had type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips, was previously treated with insulin and naproxen, and was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol post-procedure. On presentation, his temperature was 38°C (100.4°F), pulse 93/min, and blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg, with mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet on examination. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin count 14 g/dL; leukocyte count 16,400/mm3 with segmented neutrophils 56%, eosinophils 11%, lymphocytes 31%, monocytes 2%; platelet count 260,000/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h; serum urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL; creatinine 4.2 mg/dL. Renal biopsy identified intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles consistent with cholesterol clefts occluding small arteries. The constellation of a recent vascular intervention, acute kidney injury marked by reduced urine output and elevated creatinine, eosinophilia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cutaneous manifestations compatible with livedo reticularis implicates microembolization of cholesterol crystals from disrupted atherosclerotic plaque, resulting in small-vessel occlusion and end-organ ischemic injury. The most likely diagnosis is cholesterol embolism."
