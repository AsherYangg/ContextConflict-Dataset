    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision. The patientвЂ™s echocardiogram (ECG) is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His temperature is 99.5В°F (37.5В°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patientвЂ™s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision as the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on impact. Vital signs included temperature 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure 107/58 mmHg, pulse 120/min, respirations 17/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air; he was treated with 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. The cardiac tracing (echocardiogram [ECG]) was notable only for sinus tachycardia. He reported chest pain, and physical examination revealed an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Initial workup demonstrated elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins. In the setting of blunt chest trauma, chest wall ecchymoses indicate significant anterior thoracic impact, and the combination of chest pain, sinus tachycardia (which may reflect pain, anxiety, or underlying myocardial injury), elevated troponins, and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is most consistent with myocardial damage or strain from direct myocardial impact. While severe complications such as rupture may occur, the aggregate findings in this hemodynamically marginal but not profoundly unstable patient most parsimoniously indicate blunt myocardial injury. Myocardial Contusion.",
        "source_2": "In this case of a 27-year-old unrestrained front seat driver involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision, the pretest probability of traumatic cardiac injury is high. The patient’s vital signs were temperature 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure 107/58 mmHg, pulse 120/min, respirations 17/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air; he received 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. The echocardiogram (ECG) was notable only for sinus tachycardia, and physical examination identified an uncomfortable young man with bruising over the chest wall, both of which increase suspicion for blunt chest trauma. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated, a classic hemodynamic perturbation described in cardiac tamponade, thereby strengthening the overall probability of significant cardiac involvement. Concurrent elevation of troponins indicates myocardial injury and, in the context of trauma, favors contusion rather than primary ischemic infarction. The patient’s active complaint of chest pain further supports a traumatic cardiac injury framework. Synthesizing mechanism, examination, hemodynamics, and biomarkers, the most likely diagnosis is a blunt myocardial injury due to the collision. Cardiac Contusion."
