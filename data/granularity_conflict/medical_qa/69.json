    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows the same pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. What is the most likely diagnosis?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "A 57-year-old woman with a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Raynaud syndrome, taking metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin, appears well with vital signs within normal limits and no abnormalities on physical examination. On bedside tuning fork assessment, a vibrating fork placed on the left mastoid process is no longer heard; immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again, and the same test repeated on the right side shows the same pattern, indicating air conduction exceeds bone conduction bilaterally (Rinne positive). When the fork is placed on the middle of the forehead, the sound is heard louder in the right ear, a lateralization pattern consistent with sensorineural rather than conductive pathology. Taken together, the chronic unilateral symptoms and the combination of Rinne-positive bilaterally with Weber lateralizing away from the symptomatic side support a sensorineural etiology. Sensorineural hearing loss",
        "source_2": "The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome, on metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin, who appears well and has normal vital signs and a normal physical examination. Bedside testing demonstrates that when a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process, it becomes inaudible; immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again, and repeating the same maneuver on the right side yields the same pattern, consistent with air conduction greater than bone conduction bilaterally (Rinne positive). With the tuning fork placed on the middle of the forehead (Weber), the sound is perceived louder in the right ear, which in the setting of a positive Rinne indicates sensorineural hearing loss on the contralateral (left) side. This constellation of unilateral symptoms, preserved air-bone relationship, and contralateral Weber lateralization establishes the side-specific diagnosis. Left-sided sensorineural hearing loss.",
        "source_3": "In a 57-year-old woman reporting 6 months of tinnitus and progressive left-sided hearing decline, with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome and current use of metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin, and with normal vital signs and an unremarkable physical examination, the tuning fork findings are definitive: on the left, a vibrating fork placed on the mastoid is not heard, and immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, holding the fork over the left ear restores the perception of sound; the same test repeated on the right side shows the identical pattern, demonstrating preserved air conduction over bone conduction bilaterally (Rinne positive) and excluding a conductive air–bone gap. When the tuning fork is placed on the middle of the forehead, the sound localizes louder to the right ear, indicating that the left ear has diminished cochlear or retrocochlear function consistent with a sensorineural deficit. Left Sensorineural Hearing Loss."
