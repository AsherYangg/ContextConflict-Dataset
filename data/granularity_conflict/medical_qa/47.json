    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. What is the most likely diagnosis?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "A 36-year-old woman presented with a painless neck mass of 3 months’ duration that had increased in size; she appeared healthy. On examination, there was a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moved with swallowing, consistent with a thyroid origin, and there was painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Neck ultrasonography demonstrated a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions, the latter suggestive of intralesional calcifications, and a fine needle aspiration biopsy was scheduled for the following week. The combination of a rapidly enlarging, firm, irregular thyroid nodule that moves with deglutition, associated cervical lymphadenopathy, and sonographic features of increased vascularity and punctate echogenic foci is characteristic of a malignant thyroid nodule rather than a benign process. Taken together, these clinical and imaging findings most strongly support the presence of thyroid cancer.",
        "source_2": "A 36-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of a painless neck lump that had increased in size; she appeared healthy. Physical examination identified a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moved with swallowing and was accompanied by painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography showed a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions, a pattern typical of microcalcifications; a fine needle aspiration biopsy was planned for the following week. The convergence of a firm, irregular, thyroid-moving nodule with cervical lymphadenopathy and sonographic microcalcifications and hypervascularity is classically associated with malignant thyroid pathology, and among thyroid malignancies, these features and the clinical context most strongly align with the common presentation of papillary neoplasia. Papillary thyroid carcinoma."
