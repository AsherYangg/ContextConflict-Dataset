    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 55-year-old man is seen in the hospital for new onset shortness of breath. The patient was hospitalized 5 days ago after initially presenting with chest pain. He was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement with resolution of his chest pain. He states that he was doing well until yesterday when he developed dyspnea while walking around the hall and occasionally when getting out of bed to use the bathroom. His shortness of breath has since progressed, and he is now having trouble breathing even at rest. His medical history is also significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. He takes aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 97В°F (36.1В°C), blood pressure is 133/62, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. On physical examination, there is a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla and an S3 heart sound. Coarse crackles are heard bilaterally. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and cardiac enzyme levels are pending. What is the most likely diagnosis?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "A 55-year-old man, hospitalized 5 days ago after initially presenting with chest pain and found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement and resolution of his chest pain, now reports dyspnea that began yesterday while walking around the hall and occasionally when getting out of bed to use the bathroom, with subsequent progression to shortness of breath at rest. His medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, and his medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, and atorvastatin. On examination, he is afebrile (temperature 97В°F [36.1В°C]) with blood pressure 133/62, pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air; a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla and an S3 heart sound are present, and coarse crackles are heard bilaterally. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and cardiac enzyme levels are pending. The temporal onset of progressive dyspnea in the days following an infarction, coupled with hypoxemia, tachypnea, bilateral crackles, and an S3, is consistent with acute pulmonary edema and left-sided volume overload, i.e., decompensated heart failure. The concurrent holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla localizes the mechanism to mitral regurgitation, a recognized mechanical complication that increases left atrial pressure and precipitates pulmonary congestion. Integrating the post-infarction timeline and the hemodynamic and auscultatory findings supports the syndromic diagnosis of Heart failure with mitral regurgitation.",
        "source_2": "A 55-year-old man experienced an ST-elevation myocardial infarction 5 days prior, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement with resolution of his chest pain, and subsequently developed new dyspnea yesterday while walking around the hall and occasionally when getting out of bed to use the bathroom; this shortness of breath has progressed to occur even at rest. His medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, and he takes aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, and atorvastatin. Vital signs demonstrate temperature 97В°F (36.1В°C), blood pressure 133/62, pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla and an S3 heart sound, with coarse crackles heard bilaterally; an electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and cardiac enzyme levels are pending. The auscultatory hallmark of a holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla is characteristic of mitral regurgitation, and the contemporaneous S3 and bilateral crackles indicate acute volume loading of the left ventricle and pulmonary congestion arising from regurgitant flow into the left atrium. In the immediate post–myocardial infarction setting, the emergence of these findings strongly implicates valvular insufficiency of the mitral apparatus as the proximate cause of the patient’s respiratory compromise; therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Mitral Regurgitation."
