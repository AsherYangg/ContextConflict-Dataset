    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7В°C (98.1В°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "In this 49-year-old man with a 6-week history of multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness, the neurologic phenotype localizes to the cerebellum based on a constellation of classic signs: a wide-based gait, inability to stand with his feet together without support, a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen (intention tremor), and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands (dysdiadochokinesia), all occurring in the setting of normal muscle strength and tone in all extremities and intact sensation to pain, vibration, and position bilaterally; mental status examination shows no abnormalities, and he is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Vital signs are unremarkable (temperature 36.7В°C [98.1В°F], pulse 88/min, blood pressure 108/70 mm Hg). The preservation of proprioception and distal strength argues against sensory ataxia or myelopathy, while the absence of cognitive change favors an isolated cerebellar process rather than diffuse cortical pathology. The subacute temporal profile over 6 weeks is compatible with a degenerative cerebellar syndrome, and the occupational history (foreman in a factory producing industrial solvents) and daily alcohol intake (one pint of rum) represent potential toxins but are not required to establish the neuroanatomic diagnosis. Collectively, these clinical features are most consistent with a primary process of cerebellar neuronal dysfunction and loss manifesting as gait and limb ataxia, i.e., cerebellar degeneration. Cerebellar degeneration.",
        "source_2": "The patient’s daily consumption of one pint of rum, in conjunction with a 6-week course of progressive imbalance and dizziness, and an examination notable for a wide-based gait, inability to stand with his feet together without support, a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen (intention tremor), and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands (dysdiadochokinesia), with preserved muscle strength and tone in all extremities, intact sensation to pain, vibration, and position bilaterally, and a normal mental status examination, is highly characteristic of alcohol-induced cerebellar injury; vital signs are stable (temperature 36.7В°C [98.1В°F], pulse 88/min, blood pressure 108/70 mm Hg), and he is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. The pattern of truncal and gait ataxia with appendicular cerebellar signs and preserved proprioception localizes to the cerebellar circuitry rather than posterior column or peripheral nerve pathways, while the absence of encephalopathy argues against acute Wernicke presentation; although he works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents, the heavy, ongoing alcohol exposure is a well-recognized etiologic driver of subacute cerebellar degeneration manifesting as postural instability and intention tremor. Taken together, these data support the specific etiologic diagnosis of alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration. Alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration."
