    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "An adult female (age 35 years) was found unconscious and presented with severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose 35 mg/dL), with prompt return to baseline following glucose replacement. She reported no prior episodes of hypoglycemia, had no significant past medical history and no history of diabetes or insulin use, and her Hgb A1c was 5.1%, indicating absence of chronic hyperglycemia. Using a Bayesian framework, the prior probability for insulinoma was considered low at approximately 1%; the combination of marked hypoglycemia and lack of diabetes or insulin use increased suspicion for insulinoma to about 10%, and the normal Hgb A1c further increased this estimate to 15%. Crucially, the C-peptide level was decreased, a finding inconsistent with endogenous hyperinsulinemia from insulinoma, which typically produces both insulin and C-peptide, and instead indicative of exogenous insulin exposure. This pivot in the evidentiary profile markedly increased the posterior probability for factitious hypoglycemia (self-induced for attention or other psychological reasons) to about 60%. In the setting of a significant psychosocial stressor (a difficult divorce), which is known to be associated with factitious behaviors, the probability was further raised to approximately 85%. The constellation of a single severe hypoglycemic event, normal Hgb A1c, decreased C-peptide, absence of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, and salient psychosocial stress supports surreptitious insulin administration as the proximate cause; the likely diagnosis is factitious hypoglycemia.",
        "source_2": "A 35-year-old female was discovered unconscious with a blood glucose of 35 mg/dL and rapidly recovered after glucose replacement. She denied prior similar episodes, had no significant past medical history, and reported a family history of diabetes in her mother. Her HbA1c was 5.1%, consistent with normoglycemia over the preceding months and arguing against chronic hyperglycemia. The decreased C-peptide level, a byproduct of endogenous insulin biosynthesis, indicates that the hypoglycemic state was not driven by endogenous insulin production but rather is compatible with exogenous insulin exposure. In the context of acute-onset severe hypoglycemia, resolution with glucose, and a salient psychosocial stressor (ongoing difficult divorce), these findings collectively align with intentional production or feigning of symptoms for psychological reasons, classically described as factitious disorder imposed on self (previously known as Munchausen syndrome). The diagnostic conclusion is factitious disorder."
