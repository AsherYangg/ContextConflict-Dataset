    "question": "Based on the provided evidence, answer the following question: A 67-year-old woman presents from home hospice with a change in her mental status. She has seemed more confused lately and is unable to verbalize her symptoms. Her temperature is 102В°F (38.9В°C), blood pressure is 117/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort when palpated. Ultrasound is notable for pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones. What is the most likely diagnosis?. If there are multiple answers, separate them with commas. In your explanation, point out what is correct and incorrect in the evidence.",

        "source_1": "In a 67-year-old woman presenting from home hospice with a change in mental status characterized by increased confusion and inability to verbalize her symptoms, vital signs notable for a temperature of 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure of 117/65 mmHg, pulse of 110/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, and a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort on palpation, a Bayesian diagnostic framework supports a high likelihood of gallbladder pathology without stones. In chronically ill or bedridden patients such as this individual, the prior probability of acalculous cholecystitis is 2%. The presence of a right upper quadrant mass increases the estimated probability to 10%. Superimposed systemic features—here, increased confusion compatible with sepsis or systemic inflammation—raise the posterior probability to 20%. Decisively, ultrasonographic demonstration of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones substantially elevates the probability to 80%. Taken together, this stepwise evidence synthesis identifies the most likely diagnosis as Acalculous Cholecystitis.",
        "source_2": "A 67-year-old woman from home hospice with a change in mental status—manifested by increased confusion and inability to verbalize her symptoms—presents with fever to 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure of 117/65 mmHg, pulse of 110/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air; examination reveals a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort, and ultrasound demonstrates pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones. In debilitated hosts, acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is a recognized entity that frequently presents with systemic inflammatory features such as confusion or sepsis rather than classic biliary colic, reflecting underlying biliary stasis and gallbladder ischemia that culminate in inflammation. The conjunction of a compatible clinical context (home hospice), systemic signs (fever, altered mentation), focal right upper quadrant findings, and imaging evidence of gallbladder inflammation in the absence of stones is diagnostic of Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis."
