        "source_1": "I did three nights here in April as a solo traveler. Booked direct for about €68 a night and arrived around 21:30; check-in took five minutes and then a climb up a steep, narrow staircase. My room (204) faced a small alley. The mattress was fine, but the linens felt a bit tired, and I found a few hairs in the shower corners. The radiator clicked on and off at night and the walls let in hallway voices, so earplugs helped. The big win was being able to walk to Dam Square in about 8 minutes and to the station in under 10. I basically used the place to crash between museum visits; with the stairs and nighttime noise, I wouldn’t bring my kids, but alone it did the job.",
        "source_2": "Price-only take: I watched rates across the center for a mid-November Friday and Saturday. Most spots near the canals were well over €120 per night; this one came in at €55 for a nonrefundable single, €62 for flexible. City tax and fees added roughly €7–€8 per night at checkout. No deposit was taken—just a card preauth—and they let me switch from Saturday to Sunday without a change fee as long as I kept the same rate plan. No breakfast bundled, which kept the base rate low; bakery across the street had coffee and a croissant for €4.",
        "source_3": "Location-only take: Traveled with my partner and a 4-year-old plus a stroller. On the map it looked next to Centraal, but with two suitcases and cobblestones it took us about 17 minutes on foot; doable, just slower than expected. Dam Square was an easy 8-minute walk, and an Albert Heijn supermarket was three minutes away for snacks. At night, bars on the surrounding lanes pushed out chatter until around 2 a.m. on Saturday, and you can hear trams clanging in the distance at rush hour. Convenience for sightseeing was excellent, but with a small child the crowds around Warmoesstraat were a bit much in the evenings.",
        "source_4": "Cleanliness-only take: Overnighted before an early train and was assigned a second-floor room just as housekeeping finished. The bathroom smelled of freshly used cleaner, grout lines were bright, and the mirror had no water spots. Sheets were crisp, pillowcases spotless, and there wasn’t dust under the bed when I checked with a quick swipe of a towel. Trash bin was lined and empty, and the sink drain ran clear with no residue. Some scuffs on the wall paint near the door, but surfaces and textiles were well tended.",
        "source_5": "Room size/design-only take: I booked a single and it felt like a ship cabin. The bed was tucked against the wall, and my carry-on had to stand upright between the desk and the door. Shower stall measured roughly the width of my shoulders (I’m 6'2\"), so turning around was tight. No wardrobe, just wall hooks and a small rail, plus a fold-down desk that barely fit a 13-inch laptop. Power outlets were by the headboard, which was handy, but there was nowhere to lay out a second bag. Functional for one person with minimal luggage; two people would be on top of each other.",
        "source_6": "We did a weekend as a couple with a teenager and took a top-floor triple. Two steep flights to reach it, but once inside the double-glazed windows blocked most street sound and we slept through till morning. The room wasn’t spacious, yet the beds were comfortable enough, and we spent our days out anyway. Staff stored our backpacks after checkout so we could visit NEMO before the train. From the front door we walked to the station in about 9 minutes, grabbed stroopwafels on the way, and hit the Anne Frank House by foot later that afternoon. I’d be fine booking again with my nephew for a quick city visit."
