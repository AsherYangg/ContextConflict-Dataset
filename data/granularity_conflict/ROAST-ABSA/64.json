        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the chipset and it does push through compute-heavy tasks well. Exporting a 4K clip in CapCut with multiple filters finished faster than my older device, and large ZIP archives unpack quickly. Running a local language model demo and some Python scripts via Termux didn’t choke it either. CPU clocks stay high for short bursts, and single-core tasks like photo processing in Snapseed feel immediate. I’m not a gamer, so my take is strictly about raw processing and creator apps.",
        "source_2": "I picked it up for gaming and ran Genshin Impact and CoD Mobile for a week. Even on lowered graphics, frames dip hard after 10–15 minutes, the action gets choppy, and I’ve been kicked to the home screen multiple times. Twice I got a “System UI not responding” dialog after a freeze, and only a reboot fixed it. Menus hitch when I jump between Discord and the game, and there are frequent micro-stutters during team fights. The phone also gets a bit warm near the top-right, which seems to make the slowdowns worse.",
        "source_3": "My issue is with RAM management. With just Spotify and Telegram open, switching to Chrome for a couple of tabs and then back causes one of them to reload, and the music occasionally stops when I open the camera. Even two apps don’t reliably stay in memory; I’ll answer a message, return to Maps, and it restarts the route. I disabled battery optimizations for these apps and turned off adaptive features, but the reloads persist. The recent apps screen looks full, yet the system clears my last tasks aggressively.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on the UI: lots of little glitches add up. The notification shade sometimes flickers when I pull it down during a call, and the brightness slider jumps to max on its own. Back gestures occasionally don’t register, then trigger twice, and the keyboard overlaps the bottom of forms in a few apps until I rotate the screen. I’ve also seen a blank home screen with icons loading in late, and once after ending a call I got “System UI not responding.” None of these are showstoppers individually, but they crop up daily.",
        "source_5": "As an everyday phone for calls, WhatsApp, email, and YouTube, it holds up fine for me. Scrolling through social feeds is smooth most of the time, and casual titles like Subway Surfers run without drama. When I try heavier games or juggle multiple apps, that’s when hitches and app reloads start. It warms up a little during long sessions, but not to the point where I have to put it down. If your routine is mostly streaming and browsing, it feels serviceable; power users will hit the limits quickly.",
        "source_6": "Temperature observations only: during 25–30 minutes of Asphalt 9, the back near the camera cluster warms to around 40–41°C (checked with a cheap IR thermometer). The heat is noticeable but not painful, more of a steady warmth that builds up under a case. After it warms, I see more dips in frame rate, and returning to the launcher can take a beat. Outside of gaming, in maps navigation and video calls, it stays cooler with just a mild rise after 10 minutes."
