        "source_1": "I’ve been using the phone as my daily driver for two weeks. The chassis feels tight with no creaks, and the buttons have a reassuring click. Indoors the screen looks lively; at my desk I keep brightness around 60% and text is easy to read. Outside at noon I push it to max and Maps stays legible, though I sometimes cup the screen with a hand. On a typical workday (email, Slack, Spotify streaming over Wi‑Fi, some Instagram), I unplug at 7 a.m. and usually plug back in around midnight with roughly 15–25% left. Opening heavier apps like Instagram or Photos occasionally stalls for a second, and with only 2 GB of RAM I do see apps reload when I bounce between three or four of them. The camera produces colorful shots of food and pets, but when I zoom in on leaves or hair, edges look a bit smeared. The bottom speaker is loud for podcasts, yet music through it sounds thin; plugging in wired earbuds and nudging the bass in the EQ helps a lot.",
        "source_2": "I bought this specifically to see if 2 GB RAM would be enough for light multitasking, and it’s tight. With WhatsApp, Chrome (3–4 tabs), and YouTube open, switching back to Chrome often reloads the tab. The keyboard sometimes hesitates for a beat before appearing, and opening the camera from the lock screen can take 3–4 seconds if I’ve been using other apps. I turned off animations in Developer Options and switched to a lightweight launcher, which reduces the stutters, but the phone still needs to catch its breath when I jump between apps quickly.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the battery only: my routine is GPS navigation for a 40‑minute commute each way, Bluetooth audio in the car, and about an hour of social media at lunch. By 5 p.m. I’m typically at 30–35%, and if I have an evening gym session with music and workout tracking, I need a top‑up. Screen‑on time averages around 4.5–5 hours for me. Overnight, with Wi‑Fi and notifications on, it drops about 8–10%. Battery saver kicks in by dinner on busier days.",
        "source_4": "Just about the display: indoors it looks fine, but hiking under direct sun exposed its limits. Even at 100% brightness I found myself tilting and squinting to read trail maps, and colors washed out at steep angles. Auto‑brightness also felt sluggish, taking a couple of seconds to ramp up when I walked outdoors. Back at home, watching videos in a dim room, the panel looks punchy and sharp.",
        "source_5": "Camera impressions after a family birthday: I shot everything at 1x and kept auto‑HDR on. Faces came out crisp enough that I could see individual hair strands when I cropped in a bit, and the candlelit cake shots balanced the warm glow without turning the background into a black blob. Motion blur wasn’t an issue for the kids blowing out candles, and indoor shots retained fine textures on the tablecloth. I didn’t need to edit much besides a slight exposure tweak.",
        "source_6": "Strictly about audio: the built‑in speaker is plenty loud for podcasts but gets piercing on certain vocals and cymbals, and bass lines barely register. On the same tracks through my Sony MDR‑EX155 earbuds, the sound opens up; with Spotify’s EQ adding a small low‑end bump (+2 to +3 dB), kick drums and bass guitars come through and the harshness calms down. If you rely on the speaker for music in a quiet room, it does the job, but it’s not something I’d use for longer listening sessions."
