        "source_1": "I arrived at Wonderful Watertown just before midnight after a delayed flight and asked for a crib and two extra pillows. The front desk said they’d send them “right up,” but 40 minutes passed with nothing. I called again, went down once to check, and finally got everything after about 75 minutes. The next morning I tried to print boarding passes; the lobby printer was out of toner, and it took another half hour to sort out a workaround. Between the waits and the apologies, I felt like I had to chase every request.",
        "source_2": "I booked the Boardroom Suite to get a quiet workspace and the views I saw mentioned online. My windows looked onto a flat roof dotted with vents and a sliver of skyline if I pressed against the glass. The conference-style table was handy, but the roof HVAC units hummed all night—I measured around 52 dB on my phone—and the thin curtains let in sunrise at 6 a.m. After paying for a suite, I expected a different outlook.",
        "source_3": "Three-night stay in the View Suite. Check-in took five minutes and the staff greeted me by name. The “view” faced a construction site with cranes and tarps, so I kept the shades down most evenings. Housekeeping kept things tidy, but the shower pressure fluctuated and the thermostat drifted from 68 to 75 without any input. At $329 per night before taxes and a destination fee, I kept wondering whether the extras lined up with the bill.",
        "source_4": "Value-only take: I booked Wonderful Watertown because friends said the rate made sense for the area. My invoice told a different story—base room charge plus $30 for parking, $18 for an amenity bundle, and $12 for two lobby coffees I thought were included. Even with a AAA discount, the final total jumped well past the quote. The location near The Ave is convenient, but the add-ons at checkout overshadowed the rest.",
        "source_5": "Quick solo getaway. I liked walking four blocks to the University District and browsing the quirky shops on The Ave. Back at the hotel, the lobby felt cozy and the bartender remembered my order. In the room, the window whistled when the wind picked up, and the wall between me and the neighboring suite didn’t block much; I heard their 6 a.m. alarm and their phone call word for word. The front desk handed me earplugs, which took the edge off but didn’t fix the whistling.",
        "source_6": "We hosted a client meeting in the hotel’s Boardroom Suite. The big table and plentiful outlets made it easy to set up laptops, and the catering arrived on time. We had chosen the space partly for impressive views, but our backdrop turned out to be a parking lot and a brick facade. The staff tried rearranging chairs to avoid glare; we ended up closing the blinds. Clients were polite about it, yet the space didn’t match the brochure shots we’d seen."
