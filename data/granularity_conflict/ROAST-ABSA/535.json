        "source_1": "I chose this place mainly for proximity to Centraal Station. From the lobby it took me about seven minutes to walk to my train platform, and the canal tour dock was basically across the road. In the evenings I grabbed dinner on Nieuwendijk—lots of options within a block—and there’s a tram stop nearby, so getting to Museumplein was straightforward. If you’re not used to Amsterdam, the bike lanes are everywhere; crossing Prins Hendrikkade required a bit of attention.",
        "source_2": "I stayed in room 317 and paid close attention to how the room was kept. The bathroom tiles and grout looked fresh, the mirror was streak-free, and the towels smelled just laundered. Housekeeping came around 10:30 each morning, swapped out linens, and tidied without moving my stuff. I checked under the bed and behind the curtains and didn’t find dust or stray items.",
        "source_3": "I booked under the Crowne Plaza banner expecting touches like a robe, a stocked minibar, and maybe a fancier coffee setup than a basic kettle. The room was straightforward and functional, more in line with business-travel basics than anything plush. Check-in was smooth and the place ran efficiently, but the amenities matched what I usually see in three-star city properties. I caught a promo rate that made sense for what was offered; at full “four-star” prices I would have hesitated.",
        "source_4": "Weekend in mid-November, and we used the hotel as a base to walk everywhere—Dam Square, restaurants on the side streets, and a canal boat picked us up near Centraal. The front desk handed over keys in under five minutes, and elevators moved fast even during the morning rush. The room was compact but organized: hot shower, quiet air unit, solid Wi‑Fi, and no quirks with the fixtures. For a quick city break, it did the job without fuss.",
        "source_5": "I focused on how the place handled logistics. Arrived at 8 a.m. and they tagged and stored our bags right away so we could start sightseeing. Later, mobile check-in had our keys prepped, and I was in the room within two minutes of reaching the desk. Breakfast seating was managed with a simple list, and elevator waits were short, even with multiple floors stopping.",
        "source_6": "My room looked onto a lane packed with bars, which was handy for late-night snacks but came with clinking glasses and voices past midnight. Canal tour boats honked during the day, and delivery trucks kicked off around 6 a.m., so earplugs were useful. The walk to Centraal was quick, but crossing the bike lanes by the hotel kept me on my toes—cyclists appear fast from both directions. If early nights matter, I’d ask for an interior-facing room."
