        "source_1": "I booked four nights over St. Patrick’s weekend and treated it as a city base. Check-in at 3 pm was straightforward; the front desk walked me through parade timings, printed a small map, and helped me store a bag until my room was ready. My tab at the lobby bar matched what I ordered every night, and the receipts were itemized without any surprises. On the 35th floor, the room was quiet, the shower water pressure was strong, and housekeeping swapped towels and toiletries daily. From the entrance, it was a 10–12 minute walk to the parade route and about the same to Temple Bar.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the bar only: I started keeping a strict tally on a notepad because twice our table slip showed extra drinks—one night it was two additional gin and tonics, another night a stout I didn’t order. When I asked for the itemized breakdown, the server insisted it was ours, but the manager looked at the timestamps and removed the items. After that, I paid at the counter each round and had them stamp the receipt, which stopped the add-ons.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on room cleanliness: On arrival, I found long strands of hair on the shower wall and dust along the top shelf of the bedside unit. There was also a sticky ring on the desk like a glass had been set down and not wiped. I called down and asked for a full refresh; the next day the bathroom corners, mirrors, and surfaces were cleaned thoroughly and the desk mark was gone. The initial impression wasn’t what I expected, but the follow-up passthrough addressed it.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on reception: I landed close to midnight and expected a slog, but the desk processed my check-in in under five minutes, handed me two bottles of water without me asking, and set up a 6:30 am taxi with a printed confirmation. They pointed me to the overnight snack options and circled the parade start on a paper map. The tone was calm and efficient, which helped after a late flight.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on room design features: The layout felt more old-school than the photos suggested—brown carpeting, heavy patterned curtains, a scratched veneer desk, and separate hot and cold taps in the bathroom. The bedside lamps were dim even at full setting, and the wardrobe doors squeaked unless you closed them slowly. It worked, but the overall vibe read more early-2010s business hotel than current minimalist design.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after four nights: The skyline view from our 36th-floor window and the quick stroll to the river were highlights, but interactions at the desk were tense at peak times—short answers, a few eye rolls when I asked about late checkout—and we had to dispute two separate bar slips where the server implied we hadn’t settled our tab. Both issues got fixed after back-and-forth with a manager, yet it ate up time we’d planned for the festival. The room itself was quiet, and housekeeping stopped by daily without fail."
