        "source_1": "I signed up to refresh my programming basics while juggling a full-time job. The course moved steadily from URLs and HTTP headers into JSON parsing and a light intro to SQLite. By the last week, I had a small script pulling data from a public API and storing records in a local database, which I repurposed at work to clean a mailing list. The weekly checkpoints and forum threads kept me progressing without falling behind.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on comprehensiveness: during the APIs module, several steps felt skipped. Pagination and deeply nested JSON were only shown at a surface level, and there was no concrete walk-through of handling 429 rate-limit responses. When the assignment involved OAuth, the token refresh flow wasn’t covered in the lectures, so I replayed segments and ended up piecing it together from external docs.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on teaching style: Dr. Chuck repeats key ideas without sounding mechanical, deliberately introduces small errors and then fixes them, and explains list/dict iteration using simple, incremental examples. He avoids heavy jargon until the basics land, draws quick diagrams to show data flow, and checks comprehension by summarizing before moving on. Those habits made it easier for me to follow along without pausing every minute.",
        "source_4": "Platform-specific experience: the course content itself was clear, but the Coursera setup caused friction. The autograder expected Python 3.9 and flagged my f-strings with advanced formatting from 3.11, even though the output matched. The mobile app kept losing my place, so the desktop site wouldn’t unlock the next quiz. Two lectures had captions drifting a few seconds off, which threw off my notes and time stamps.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture take: I finished the course on time, but the pacing felt uneven. Several lectures wandered into long anecdotes, then topics like SQL joins appeared abruptly with only brief context, so I paused often to fill gaps with outside articles. The capstone task—hooking an API to SQLite and producing a small report—did tie everything together for me, yet most weeks I advanced more through trial and error than from the videos alone."
