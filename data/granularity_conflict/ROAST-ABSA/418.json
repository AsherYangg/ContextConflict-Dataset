        "source_1": "I rewatched the Module 2 videos three times and still couldn’t clear the quiz. Several questions asked about phrasal verbs (like “run into” vs “run over”) that never showed up in the lecture examples. A couple of items referenced a reading passage that wasn’t in the video playlist, so I kept landing around 3/10. I even paused to take notes and used the transcript, but the retake pulled a similar pool with topics I hadn’t seen.",
        "source_2": "I focused only on quiz prep and alignment. I took timestamped notes during each clip, answered the in-video practice popups, and then went straight to the quiz—every question mirrored an example or sentence pattern shown in the lectures. For instance, the conditional forms were tested with the same sentence frames the instructor demoed. I passed each quiz on the first attempt by pausing, rewinding tricky parts, and cross-checking with the downloadable transcript.",
        "source_3": "I’m confused about the “other languages” portions. In the first week, there’s a section comparing how to say “hello” in Italian, Hindi, and Japanese. I enrolled to improve English for work email, so I didn’t see how that detour helped me. The quiz for that week didn’t use those comparisons, and the segment added five extra minutes to an already long lesson.",
        "source_4": "I took the course end-to-end over four weeks and treated it as a full program. The pacing made it manageable—two video blocks per day, then the weekly quiz and a small peer review. The instructor chimed in on a few forum threads and shared a checklist before each assessment. I finished with the certificate and found the culture-and-language snippets useful as memory hooks for pronunciation and greeting etiquette, even if they weren’t directly tested.",
        "source_5": "After a month, I still couldn’t get past the Week 3 quiz. I studied the videos, paused to copy the grammar tables, and practiced with the worksheet PDFs, yet my scores hovered under the passing mark. The discussion board didn’t yield responses to my specific questions, and on mobile the app signed me out mid-quiz, which wiped an attempt. I finally stopped the course without completing it.",
        "source_6": "Narrow take on accessibility: the English captions didn’t always match the spoken words, which made note-taking tricky. Auto-translate to Spanish drifted on idioms, so I kept the playback at 0.75x and used the interactive transcript to search terms like “present perfect.” The quiz timer felt tight; as a non-native reader I ran out of time on longer reading items and had to retake to finish all questions."
