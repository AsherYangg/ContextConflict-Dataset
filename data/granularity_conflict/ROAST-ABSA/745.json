        "source_1": "I was looking for a citrus-chocolate profile for weekend lattes, and this Orange coffee fit right into my routine. The beans show little flecks of peel, and when I grind for a French press (coarse, 1:15 ratio), I get a bright orange note over a cocoa-like base that stays present through the whole mug. In a moka pot, it leans richer, almost like a candied peel over darker chocolate. I can skip syrups because the cup already carries that layered citrus character without tasting sugary.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on flavor only: the orange component takes over my palate. On a V60, even with a medium grind and cooler water (92°C), the cup leans pithy, as if I zested too deep into the peel. After a couple of sips, the coffee character feels buried, so I started cutting it 50/50 with a neutral medium roast to dial back the citrus. Straight, it leaves a lingering rind-like aftertaste that hangs around longer than I prefer.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the physical orange pieces: those fragments do not play nicely with my gear. In my Baratza burr grinder, the peel bits jammed at the chute twice, and I had to tap the hopper to clear them. When I switched to a Kalita Wave, the pieces floated and slowed the drawdown, turning a 3-minute brew into over 5. I ended up hand-sifting the grounds to remove larger peel chunks, which added annoying prep time and still left sediment at the bottom of the cup.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, the bag I received was underwhelming. The moment I opened it, the aroma felt faint for a flavored coffee, and the beans looked a bit dull. I tried espresso (18g in, 36g out, 28 seconds), AeroPress, and drip, adjusting grind and temperature, but the orange note stayed timid and the cup tasted flat across methods. The one-way valve on the bag seemed oddly stiff, and the bloom on pour-over barely lifted, which made me suspect the roast had sat too long before shipping.",
        "source_5": "I’m focusing strictly on aroma here: cracking the seal released a wave of candied orange peel that filled the kitchen in seconds. During the bloom on my V60, the steam smelled like holiday biscotti, and even after brewing, the empty filter gave off a warm citrus scent for a good ten minutes. The fragrance clings to my grinder bin and cupboard, so every time I open it, I get a little burst of orange without even making a new cup."
