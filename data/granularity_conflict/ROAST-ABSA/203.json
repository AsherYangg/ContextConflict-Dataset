        "source_1": "I booked the Century Suite for a midweek conference because I needed a quiet place to prep. The base rate looked okay on the site, but the bill for two nights landed at just over $900 after taxes and fees, with parking separate. At that price point I expected breakfast or lounge access to be bundled, but neither was included. I’m focusing only on cost here—the room may suit others—but the pricing sat above what I’ve paid for similar suites nearby.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about sleep, and the Century Suite hit the mark for rest. The bedroom had heavy curtains that blocked the sunrise, the hallway stayed hushed even during early checkouts, and the AC held a steady temperature without a loud compressor kick. The mattress felt supportive, pillows came in two firmness levels, and the sofa plus desk setup let me work a few hours without back strain. If your priority is a calm, comfortable room, this setup does the job.",
        "source_3": "Heads-up on the minibar in the Century Suite. It’s sensor-based: I shifted a soda for a moment to make space for my water bottle, and a charge hit my folio immediately. The placard by the bar says items are billed when moved, not when consumed. The front desk showed me the timestamp and could only reverse part of it. Next time I’ll request the minibar be emptied ahead of check-in to avoid accidental charges.",
        "source_4": "We used the Century Suite for a birthday weekend and spent a lot of time in the room. The layout felt like a small apartment—separate sitting area, wide desk, and enough space to open two suitcases at once without crowding. Street noise stayed outside, and we slept late without interruptions. The nightly rate ran high and the minibar policy took a minute to decipher, but the comfort made the trip easy. I’d book the same room again and tell friends to spring for it if they plan to relax in-room.",
        "source_5": "I stayed in the Century Suite during a trade show. The room was roomy and pleasantly quiet, but the total cost climbed quickly between the nightly rate and a minibar charge that triggered when I reorganized the fridge. For what I paid, I expected more flexibility with incidentals. Next time I’ll go with a smaller room and put the difference toward meals and transport."
