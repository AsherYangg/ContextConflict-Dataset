        "source_1": "I stayed at Ohana West from 1/22 to 1/29 and ended up on the 16th floor in a king room facing the city and mountains (room 1608). The lanai had two chairs and a small table, and we ate breakfast out there most mornings. The room itself wasn’t huge, but it was tidy every day and the bed and pillows worked for me. Housekeeping showed up early, usually before we got back from coffee, and the front desk walked me through bus directions to Pearl Harbor. From the hotel it took us about 8–10 minutes to reach the beach on foot, and we used the nearby bus stop for Diamond Head and Ala Moana. This isn’t a resort-style place, but the rate fit our budget and the location made getting around simple.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on room size: my king room felt tight once our luggage was open. With two suitcases and a stroller, the walkway between the bed and the TV stand was maybe two feet, so we had to turn sideways to reach the lanai door. The closet had sliding doors that caught on hangers, and the bathroom counter didn’t leave much space for two toiletry kits. I’m 6'2\", and the shower/tub combo had a curtain that stuck to me, which made it feel even narrower. The lanai itself had decent space, but the interior layout was snug for a couple with gear.",
        "source_3": "I’m picky about housekeeping routines, and the team here was on point the whole week. By about 9:15 a.m., our room was already made up: fresh towels, trash cleared, coffee packs replenished, and you could see vacuum lines still on the carpet. On our third day I asked for extra pillows and more shampoo at the desk and Housekeeping brought them up in under ten minutes. They kept the lanai swept even after we tracked in sand, and when we left a note about a slow-draining sink, it was fixed before dinner.",
        "source_4": "I chose Ohana West for the central location, but light sleepers should know my room took in a lot of city noise. The AC unit had a rattle when it cycled on, and I could hear hallway door latches in the late evening. One night a trash truck on the street woke me around 2 a.m., and another night I caught elevator chimes through the wall. The mattress leaned firm and the pillows were thick, so between the setup and the noise, I didn’t get much uninterrupted rest. If you need a quiet spot for early mornings, plan on earplugs or ask for a room away from the street.",
        "source_5": "We booked two rooms for a family trip and kept costs down with an advance-purchase rate. The hotel sits a quick walk from the Royal Hawaiian Center, with an ABC Store across the street for snacks. The city/mountain view from our upper floor made coffee on the lanai a daily routine. Front desk arranged a late checkout for one room and held our bags after noon so we could squeeze in a last beach hour. The bus stop right outside made it easy to hop to Ala Moana and back, and we never waited long for rides."
