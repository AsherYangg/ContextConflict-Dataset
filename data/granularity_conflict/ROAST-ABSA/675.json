        "source_1": "I stayed three nights during a conference and arrived close to 11 pm; the lobby was empty and I waited about twenty minutes before the night clerk appeared. I asked for an extra pillow and was told none were available until morning. The upside was the location: two metro stops within a short walk, and I could get to Gare du Nord in one stop. The room itself worked for a short stay, but front desk interactions were unpredictable.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the room size because that mattered to me. I booked a “double,” and the bed was pushed against the wall, leaving roughly a foot of clearance on the other side. My carry-on couldn’t be opened flat on the floor, and the narrow walkway meant bumping the desk corner every time I headed to the bathroom. If you travel with two larger suitcases, plan on stacking them.",
        "source_3": "Just about the bathroom: mine looked newly redone, with white subway tiles, a rain shower head, and shiny chrome fixtures. Water pressure was strong, and the glass door sealed properly so there was no puddling. It even smelled faintly of fresh grout, so the renovation seemed recent. Towels were thick and the mirror had an anti-fog strip.",
        "source_4": "Initially the room looked tidy, but a closer look turned up dust on the baseboards and a few long hairs caught in the shower drain. The AC unit rattled through the night, and the mattress felt rigid, which made it hard to sleep after a long day walking. Breakfast was 14€ for a basket of bread, jam, and a small yogurt, and my weekday rate came to 180€ before fees. For what I got, the total felt steep.",
        "source_5": "Only commenting on location: for museum hopping, it took me 30–40 minutes with two line changes to reach the main sights, and late at night the street felt quiet enough that I preferred a taxi. The cafés nearby were pleasant but mostly closed by 10 pm, and a couple of one-way streets made rideshares circle the block. If you want to be able to walk to the river or major monuments, this area requires some planning.",
        "source_6": "Weekend stay with my teenage son. The front desk printed out directions to a football store and lent us a travel adapter, and housekeeping swapped out our towels promptly. The beds were soft enough that we both napped after arrival. At checkout, though, the bill had city tax plus a mini-bar charge we didn’t use; it got corrected, but even then the total was higher than expected for a simple room."
