        "source_1": "I enrolled during a hectic month at work and focused mostly on how the lectures were delivered. The videos were broken into bite‑sized segments (around 10–12 minutes each), the audio was crisp, and the slides stayed on screen long enough to copy equations. The instructor kept a steady pace and used consistent color‑coding when moving from CAPM to multi‑factor models, which helped me track symbols across modules. The quizzes right after each chunk mirrored the slides closely, so I could check whether I caught the derivations before moving on.",
        "source_2": "My sticking point was the jump from theory to the real market. The Fama–French section walked through the factors and the regression equation thoroughly, but there wasn’t a concrete demo of pulling the factor data from the Kenneth French Data Library, matching it to a specific ticker’s return series, and running the regression in Excel or Python. Similarly, we computed expected return with CAPM and I arrived at 15%, but I couldn’t find guidance on how to interpret that if I buy in the middle of the fiscal year—do I prorate, do I annualize from the purchase date, or adjust for partial‑year betas? An end‑to‑end case (e.g., Apple from July to December with monthly factors) would have cleared that up.",
        "source_3": "I came in with a solid background and used this as professional development for my department. The structure made it easy to plan a short workshop for teacher trainers: I repurposed the module summaries as session outlines, and the reflection prompts translated well into discussion questions for my team. I came away with a tighter way to frame risk premia for classroom demonstrations and a set of slides I could adapt. I would still add my own segment on data retrieval and implementation, but as a core framework to build on, it fit what I needed.",
        "source_4": "From a value perspective, I did the course on a single‑month subscription and finished over two weekends. The certificate was straightforward to download and the graded quizzes tracked the lectures closely, so I didn’t spend extra time deciphering unclear instructions. That said, I expected at least one graded project using live market data—pulling tickers, aligning factor files, and interpreting output—so I’m budgeting for an additional course to cover that. If you’re after credentials and conceptual clarity, one month feels sufficient; if you want hands‑on market application, plan for extra resources.",
        "source_5": "I only cared about whether complex ideas were explained in simple terms, and that part worked for me. The instructor compared beta to how sensitive a boat is to waves—small craft vs. cargo ship—which made the slope intuition stick. For expected return, there was a household‑budget analogy that mapped the risk‑free rate and risk premium to baseline bills and discretionary spending. I used those analogies to explain CAPM to a colleague who’s new to finance, and she followed along without the math."
