        "source_1": "I’m pretty single‑minded about cleanliness, and on that front the Shinjuku Washington delivered. I checked in around 10 p.m. after a long flight and found the linens crisp, no dust on the headboard or vents, and the bathroom grout bright white with the amenities sealed. The desk surface passed the “white tissue” test, the kettle was spotless inside, and there was no lingering odor even after running the shower hot. Housekeeping swapped towels and pajamas daily and lined up my slippers neatly by the door. I didn’t spend time in the lobby or use any facilities; I just needed a hygienic base to sleep and shower, and it met that need.",
        "source_2": "My experience centered on the lobby because that’s where everything ground to a halt. I arrived at 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the scene felt like a train station during rush hour—tour groups clustered around guides, suitcases stacked by the pillars, and a check‑in queue that snaked past the coffee shop. There were rope barriers but no one directing traffic, so lines bled into each other and people kept cutting by accident. It took 35 minutes to reach the desk, and during that time bell carts were parked across the walkway and a delivery trolley was blocking the elevators. Even after I got my key, finding the right tower took a couple of wrong turns because the signage near the escalators wasn’t clear.",
        "source_3": "I only want to flag the luggage policy after checkout. My flight was at 3 p.m., so I asked if they could hold one suitcase and a backpack after the 11 a.m. checkout. The clerk pointed to a laminated sign: storage charged per item, per hour. I ended up paying 600 yen for two hours for one suitcase, and they handed me a small paper ticket to reclaim it from a roped‑off corner behind the bell desk. I’ve stayed at several Tokyo hotels that kept bags for a few hours without charge, so this caught me off guard. If you plan to sightsee after checkout, factor that fee into your budget.",
        "source_4": "I stayed three nights on the 20th floor and came away feeling the place worked well for the price. The semi‑double was compact—maybe 16–17 square meters—but it had under‑bed storage, wall hooks, and a narrow shelf that fit my laptop and charger without clutter. Front desk staff greeted me in English, helped me buy an airport limousine bus ticket, and even called ahead to confirm the bus stop time. The lobby was busy around check‑in, but the roped lines moved quickly and I never waited more than 10 minutes. There’s a convenience store connected to the building, and the walk to the south exit of Shinjuku Station took me about 10 minutes through the underground passage. Because I booked direct, they tagged my suitcase and kept it until 4 p.m. on departure day without charging. For location and convenience, I’d use it again on a short trip.",
        "source_5": "One night for work was enough for me. My room (1312) had scuffed walls, a yellowed bathroom unit, and an air conditioner that rattled every time it cycled on. There was barely space to open my 25‑inch suitcase without blocking the door, and the desk chair knocked into the bed frame when I tried to turn. At checkout, I asked about a late checkout—no flexibility—and then paid to leave my bag for a couple of hours before heading to meetings. Staff handled the process but didn’t offer much in the way of guidance when I asked about the fastest route to the Marunouchi side of the station. Next time I’d rather spend more at Century Southern Tower, where I’ve had brighter rooms and smoother service.",
        "source_6": "My perspective is mostly about the staff. I landed before dawn and reached the hotel around 6 a.m., far too early for a room, but the night clerk offered to store my suitcase and handed me a map highlighting two breakfast spots that open at 7. Later that evening I realized I’d forgotten a plug adapter; the front desk found one in five minutes and sent it up. On my second night the hallway was noisy near midnight, and the agent quickly moved me down the corridor to a quieter room without a lot of paperwork. When I needed directions to the Narita Express, a staff member stepped out from behind the desk and walked me to the building exit that connects to the underground passage, marking the route on my phone."
