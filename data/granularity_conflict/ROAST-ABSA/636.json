        "source_1": "I mainly use it as my pocket camera. At my daughter’s evening soccer games, I’m getting crisp shots even under those harsh field lights, and the autofocus locks onto fast-moving players without hunting. Walking home at dusk, the sky gradients look smooth instead of blotchy, and 4K clips don’t wobble thanks to the stabilization. Portrait mode isolates faces cleanly, and close-up photos of flowers show fine texture without smearing. I’ve been editing straight on the phone and posting to Instagram without needing my mirrorless kit.",
        "source_2": "As a daily phone, it’s been unpredictable. About every couple of hours it powers off by itself, and it’s happened mid-call with my manager and while using Maps to find a client site. The shutdown takes me out of whatever I’m doing, and the reboot isn’t instant—around two minutes before I’m back in. I tried removing unused apps, cleared cache, and even did a factory reset; the behavior came back the next afternoon. I keep it plugged in at my desk during long calls just to reduce the chance of a drop, but the surprise black screen still shows up.",
        "source_3": "I’ve been using it as my main device for six weeks, juggling work email, Slack, and a couple of games during breaks. Calls sound clean in our noisy open office, and I can hotspot my laptop for an hour without the phone heating up. The screen is easy on the eyes for late-night reading, and the battery reliably gets me through a commute, meetings, and some YouTube before bed. The camera holds up for casual photos at lunch, and switching between apps is smooth. I haven’t run into any crashes or odd behavior, so I carry it without a backup.",
        "source_4": "I bought it for remote work, expecting it to handle frequent calls and navigation. Twice in one day it powered off in the middle of conversations with a client, and once it went dark while I was following directions in traffic; the map vanished and the phone took a couple of minutes to come back. I took it to a service center where they reinstalled the firmware and advised keeping the storage under 70%, but the same pattern returned later in the week. The camera does produce sharp images of my product samples, yet the random shutdowns have made me bring a second phone to meetings.",
        "source_5": "I track battery behavior closely. Starting at 7:30 a.m. with full charge, I streamed music for three hours, shot about 60 photos during lunch, did 45 minutes of GPS navigation in the afternoon, and watched two episodes on the train home. By 9:15 p.m. it sat at 32%. Fast charging took it from 18% to 80% in roughly 35 minutes while I cooked dinner. I keep brightness at around 60% and mobile data on all day. For my routine, I don’t worry about carrying a power bank.",
        "source_6": "My priority is call reliability. I’m on 60–90 minute conference calls several times a week, usually on speaker with a small desk fan blowing nearby, and the phone stays responsive the entire time. The dialer reconnects quickly after handoffs between office Wi‑Fi and LTE, and I haven’t seen the screen freeze or go dark mid-conversation. I turned off aggressive battery optimizations for our VoIP app, and with that setup, calls proceed without interruptions."
