        "source_1": "I bought this for my mom, who mostly calls, checks WhatsApp, and streams a little radio. After a full day that starts around 7 a.m., the battery usually ends with more than half left. The interface didn’t confuse her, call quality is clear, and she hasn’t run into hiccups opening the dialer, photos, or the browser. For what we paid, it does everything she expects without fuss, and she’s not hunting for more storage or speed.",
        "source_2": "I rely on my phone for work and installed around 60 apps on day one (Slack, Teams, Drive, Maps, banking, notes, two email clients). With five or six apps in the background, jumping between Maps and messages forces reloads, and music sometimes stutters when opening heavier apps. Large attachments in email take a moment to render, and the keyboard can lag when switching chats quickly. It functions, but juggling tasks all afternoon gets tiring.",
        "source_3": "I picked it up during a weekend sale for under two hundred dollars, and that price was the deciding factor. In this range, I usually expect surprise fees or corners cut that show up immediately, but this handled calls, hotspots for my tablet, and daily texting without extra add-ons. I didn’t feel pushed to buy accessories or insurance to make it usable, and I’m fine with the trade-offs at this cost.",
        "source_4": "My use is mostly photos of my kids and our dog in daylight. The camera locks focus fast enough outside, skin tones look natural, and 1080p clips upload to Instagram without needing edits on my laptop. Indoor shots after sunset are softer, but for sharing to family chats it’s totally fine. I back up once a week to Google Photos, so storage hasn’t been an issue for me.",
        "source_5": "After a week as my only device, I installed about 100 apps, shoot video at school events, and keep navigation on during commutes. With that setup, I’m seeing frequent pauses—tapping into the gallery right after recording video hangs for a second, and switching from a video call to email and back often reconnects the call. After an evening of photos and clips, the phone gets warm and the battery drops faster than I’d like, so I carry a power bank now.",
        "source_6": "Focusing just on battery: with my routine (two hours of podcasts over Bluetooth, light browsing, and a few short calls), I average around six hours of screen-on time and still have some charge left at night. A 30-minute session of continuous video recording drains it noticeably more than web reading does, and charging from low to full with the included brick takes long enough that I plug in before bed rather than topping up midday."
