        "source_1": "I got this bottle as a birthday gift from my sister, and it immediately changed how I finish meals. It’s thick and glossy enough that a few drops over arugula with olive oil and sea salt feels complete, and it did something magical to grilled peaches and a scoop of vanilla gelato. Compared with the supermarket stuff I’d been using, this one leans into deep fruit notes—fig and cherry come to mind—and a little goes a long way. It’s become my go-to when I want a small flourish at the end of a dish.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on fruit pairings: I tested it side-by-side on strawberries, pears, and a slice of Parmigiano. On the cheese, the sweetness and tang balanced nicely, but on strawberries it took over, leaving a lingering bite that distracted from the fruit. Even after trying a smaller drizzle, the finish stayed a bit harsh for dessert. For fruit, I’ll stick with a lighter, brighter bottle and reserve this one for savory boards.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about texture and behavior on greens: the viscosity felt thinner than I expected. It pooled at the bottom of my salad bowl instead of clinging to the leaves, so I had to whisk it with mustard to get any grip. The aroma was assertive out of the bottle, which worked in a rosemary-garlic marinade for chicken, but as a finishing drizzle on delicate lettuce it came across as a little sharp and watery rather than syrupy.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the presentation impressed me—the bottle looks great on the counter—but the cork wept after first use and left a sticky ring. Flavor-wise, it had an edge that needed softening, so I ended up using it mainly to deglaze a pan with butter and shallots for steak rather than on raw applications. Considering the price, I expected a rounder finish for cheese plates and berries; for me, it performs better in cooking than as a showpiece drizzle.",
        "source_5": "I hosted a small tasting and poured tiny sips into spoons, then served it with baguette, Parmigiano, and thin slices of pear. Half the table asked where to buy it after the first round, while a couple of friends thought the intensity crowded the fruit. If you enjoy a bold, concentrated profile, this will hit the spot; if you’re unsure, try a sampler or a smaller bottle before committing."
