        "source_1": "I stopped buying the big 38 oz squeeze bottle once I actually read the ingredients panel and saw high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup listed right after tomato concentrate and vinegar. I try to keep corn-based sweeteners out of my pantry, so I switched to an organic ketchup that uses cane sugar. On burgers and fries, it comes across basically the same for me, and in my local co-op it was only a few cents more per bottle, so the swap was easy.",
        "source_2": "For an overall take: this is the ketchup that’s always in my fridge door. It’s consistent across bottles, the flip-top cap makes it easy for my kids to use without grabbing a knife to pry it open, and it holds up on everything from meatloaf to hash browns. I’ve grabbed it at Target, Costco, and the corner grocer, and it’s almost always in stock. I don’t fuss over sweetener types much; I care that the texture is smooth, it doesn’t separate oddly, and it blends well into a quick meatball glaze with brown sugar and a splash of Worcestershire.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on flavor: we did a blind taste test at home with two ramekins—one Heinz, one organic cane sugar brand. The Heinz sample came across brighter and tangier, with a sharper vinegar note and a touch more salt; the organic one felt more tomato-forward and slightly rounder in sweetness. On thin-cut fries, the tangy sample cut through better; on a thick pub burger, the rounder one melded with the meat and bun. If you care purely about taste, there’s a noticeable difference.",
        "source_4": "I’m zeroing in on the sweetener aspect because it affects how I feel. When I use ketchups that list high fructose corn syrup, I notice I get jittery and hungrier a bit later—could just be me, but it’s repeatable enough that I’ve moved to cane sugar versions for everyday meals. Since my kids tend to pour a lot on chicken nuggets, I prefer a bottle with a straightforward sugar source even if it means checking labels and paying a bit more.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on price and value: the “only a few cents more” claim doesn’t line up with my receipts. At my Kroger last week, the regular 32 oz bottle was $3.49, while the organic cane sugar option of the same size sat at $5.29. Unit price on the shelf tag was about $0.11/oz vs $0.17/oz. Sales do swing things—Heinz hits BOGO or digital coupons often—but in my area, the organic swap isn’t a trivial bump.",
        "source_6": "Narrowing to packaging: the upside-down squeeze bottle is convenient, but the silicone valve gets gunky fast. After a few days, I see a sticky ring under the cap and get that watery first squirt unless I shake it hard. It’s fine for quick use at the table, but for recipes where I need a clean measure, I end up unscrewing the lid to avoid the mess. The glass bottle looked nicer and didn’t have the valve issue, but it’s less practical for kids."
