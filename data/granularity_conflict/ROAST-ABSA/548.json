        "source_1": "I’ve been using the phone as my daily driver since late 2022, and the biggest issue I keep running into is typing during incoming notifications. If I’m replying in Messages or drafting an email and a banner pops up at the top, the keyboard collapses and I end up tapping empty space. I’ve lost entire paragraphs this way. I tried switching from the stock keyboard to Gboard and turned off “heads‑up” alerts for a few apps; the behavior still shows up after the last two system patches. The camera gets me decent daylight shots, but indoor photos look flat and a bit smudgy. Overall, it does the job for calls and navigation, yet the notification‑keyboard interaction makes routine texting a chore.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the camera only: I take a lot of photos of my kids and our dog, and I’ve done side‑by‑side comparisons with an older midrange phone. In bright afternoon light, this camera captures crisp edges on hair and clothing, and skin tones don’t swing orange or grey. Portrait mode keeps background blur controlled without slicing off ears or shoulders. At night in the kitchen, tapping to focus on faces reduces noise more than I expected, and 4K video holds steady while walking around the house. Shutter lag is minimal, so I can get a burst of shots without missing the moment.",
        "source_3": "My entire experience centers on the typing workflow, because I answer work messages on the go. On WhatsApp and Gmail, as soon as an app notification slides down, the keyboard disappears and the cursor loses focus. If I try to bring it back quickly, it sometimes reopens in the wrong language layout. I recorded a screen capture for IT and tested with notifications disabled, priority notifications only, and different keyboards. It’s most reproducible with banner alerts enabled. This behavior started right after a system update in early spring, and it’s the single thing that slows me down every day.",
        "source_4": "From a full‑device perspective, mine has been rock solid after the January update. I switch between Slack, Spotify, Maps, and a couple of banking apps and leave them all in memory; the UI stays responsive and app switching is instant. I haven’t seen any random force closes in months. Calls are clear, Bluetooth stays paired to my car without hiccups, and the fingerprint reader is consistent. The camera leans toward warm tones in indoor lighting, but nothing I can’t tune with the built‑in editor. For my workload, the software feels dialed in.",
        "source_5": "Just talking battery life: I charge to 90% around 7 a.m., commute with 45 minutes of streaming, run Maps for an hour at lunch, and do about 50 minutes of calls in the afternoon. By 10 p.m., I’m usually at 28–35% without dipping into battery saver. On weekends, I shot a soccer game, recorded 20 minutes of video, and still finished the day above 40%. The charging curve is consistent—15 to 80% in roughly 35 minutes on the bundled charger—so I don’t worry about topping up before heading out.",
        "source_6": "My take on the whole package after multiple updates: the phone started out smooth, but recent patches introduced odd stutters when opening the app drawer, and that typing issue where a new notification makes the keyboard vanish happens several times a day. I’ve had to retype long notes because the input field loses focus. The camera is fine for quick outdoor snaps, yet indoor shots of my cat look soft around the whiskers and the white balance leans yellow. I keep the device because the screen and call quality are fine, but the little software quirks have piled up over time."
