        "source_1": "I booked three nights because the weekday rate looked great at $149, but the final bill told a different story: about $28 per night in taxes and a “destination” fee, plus $45 for valet since self-parking wasn’t an option when I arrived. After adding breakfast once ($27 for the buffet) and a couple of lobby coffees, the nightly spend drifted closer to $230. The room and amenities were fine, but the add-ons changed how the price felt.",
        "source_2": "I chose this place purely for logistics. Landed at MIA at 6:10 p.m., called an Uber at 6:28, and was dropped at the front door at 6:44 for $22. For downtown meetings, I walked to the Metromover in about 6 minutes and reached my client’s office in under 15. Getting to South Beach was a different story: Saturday evening it took 38–45 minutes each way because of causeway traffic, and the ride back after midnight was $34. Great for airport/downtown access, less handy for beach nightlife.",
        "source_3": "Service was a mixed bag for me. I arrived around 9 p.m. to a line of about a dozen people and waited roughly 20–25 minutes to check in even though the app had marked my room as ready. The first set of key cards didn’t work; the second set did. I asked for extra towels and a blanket at 9:40; they reached the room close to 10:50 after a follow-up call. On the bright side, the bell staff saw me juggling a garment bag and laptop and rushed over to help without being asked.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on the room: my double on the 11th floor looked halfway updated. The headboard and lighting felt newer, with two USB ports and a decent reading lamp, but the carpet near the window had visible wear and a frayed edge, and the dresser had chipped veneer. The mattress felt supportive, yet the through-wall AC cycled loudly during the night. Bathroom was compact with a quartz-style vanity, decent water pressure, but an older tub/shower combo and a fan that rattled.",
        "source_5": "Overall take from a two-night conference stay: check-in took under five minutes at 3 p.m., the lobby had a fresh look with plenty of seating, and I found a spot to work near an outlet without hunting. Room 1620 was quiet, tidy, and had enough storage for a carry-on and garment bag. I used the Metromover to get to the arena area, and an afternoon Uber to South Beach ran $17 and about 20 minutes. Paid $139 on a weekday corporate rate; with Wi‑Fi included and grab-and-go breakfast downstairs, the setup worked well for my needs."
