        "source_1": "I’ve bought these on and off for years. The last 2.5 lb jar I opened this month had a clean roasted smell right out of the seal. Cashews were firm, almonds had a dry snap, and I pulled out several whole macadamias in the first bowlful. I snacked on them plain and mixed a handful into oatmeal; no waxy coating, no odd aftertaste. This batch reminded me why I pick this brand when I want a straightforward nut mix.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing purely on cost: my Costco receipts show $17.99 in late 2022, $21.49 mid-2023, and $24.99 last week for the same 2.5 lb jar. That’s roughly a jump from about $0.72/oz to $1.00/oz in under two years. Comparable store-brand mixes at my local grocer run closer to $0.65/oz. At full shelf price, I now either wait for a coupon or pass.",
        "source_3": "I buy mixed nuts mainly for the macadamias, so I did a quick check on my latest jar. After pouring out two cereal bowls’ worth, I found maybe a tablespoon of macadamia fragments—no whole pieces—while cashews and almonds dominated, with a fair number of broken bits. The label shows big macadamias, but in my jar they were tiny chips. I ended up fishing around with a spoon and came up nearly empty.",
        "source_4": "Different experience here with the macadamias. From the top third of my jar, I counted seven whole macadamias and several halves in one large handful, alongside the usual cashews, pecans, brazil nuts, and almonds. Pieces looked intact rather than crumbs. Whatever batch I got matched the photo on the front pretty closely.",
        "source_5": "Longtime buyer giving an overall take: the last jar (best-by date about six months out) didn’t land the same. A few cashews were soft, the aroma was muted, and the mix skewed toward smaller, cheaper nuts with more broken pieces than I remember. With the shelf price creeping up at the same time, I’m planning to switch to a different mix for a while."
