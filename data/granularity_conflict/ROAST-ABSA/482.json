        "source_1": "I interacted with the teaching staff several times: I posted two detailed questions about frame conventions and controller saturation on the forum, and a TA replied the same afternoon with a small code snippet and a corrected launch file. They also ran a weekly Zoom hour where they walked through Assignment 2 logs and explained how to interpret the tracking plots. My clarifications were pinned so others could see them, and follow-up replies came within a day.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the second assignment: I spent roughly 7–8 hours nudging PID gains and trajectory smoothing parameters. Most of that time was trial-and-error in the simulator, rerunning the same route to shave a few centimeters off lateral error. The grading mainly looked at the final tracking metric, so I felt I was twisting knobs rather than learning a method, and the write-up didn’t ask for analysis of why the tuned values behaved the way they did.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, the course led me to a working waypoint trajectory and an autonomous follower in simulation by the end. The labs guided me through setting up ROS, implementing a spline-based planner, and integrating a controller that kept the drone on track around corners. Quizzes lined up with the lectures, and I wrapped the whole thing in four weeks at about 5–6 hours per week. I don’t have a traditional engineering degree, and I was still able to complete all assignments without getting blocked.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on prerequisites: I came in from a design background and hit a wall on reference frames, Jacobians, and stability margins. The videos jumped into derivative and integral terms and coordinate transforms as if everyone had recent calculus and linear algebra. I paused often to review basic dynamics and trigonometry, and ended up rewatching segments to catch up on the assumed math.",
        "source_5": "Overall, I finished with code that follows a set of waypoints in simulation, but the path to that result was bumpy. Assignment 2 took hours of parameter tuning without much explanation of why certain choices work, and several forum threads I posted to sat for days with no staff response. I leaned on classmates in a Discord group to unblock issues, and the sequence of topics felt stitched together rather than building a clear line from modeling to control."
