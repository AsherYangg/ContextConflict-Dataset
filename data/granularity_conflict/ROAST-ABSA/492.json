        "source_1": "I bought the phone in early August and the system keeps freezing on me during simple tasks. The Settings app sometimes takes 8–10 seconds to open, and switching from WhatsApp to the camera will lock up the screen until I hold the power button and force a restart. I have around 40 GB free, no games installed, and only use YouTube, Chrome, and Hotstar, yet I still get spinning loaders when pulling down quick toggles. Clearing cache and even booting in safe mode didn’t change much, and the latest patch (the one pushed on the 15th) didn’t smooth out app launches.",
        "source_2": "I only care about the camera, and that part has been solid for me. I shoot a lot of indoor photos of my toddler, and the shutter delay is low enough to catch candid moments; burst mode saves quickly and 1080p60 video doesn’t wobble when I pan across the room. Night shots pick up street signs and faces under yellow lamps without smearing text, and portrait edge detection handles stray hair reasonably. I back up to Google Photos over Wi‑Fi and can edit in Snapseed without long export waits.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday phone, it’s been dependable for me over three weeks. I run Telegram, Gmail, Spotify, and Maps in split screen during my commute, and app switching is quick enough that I can jump from a calendar invite to a call without hiccups. Netflix plays for an hour on the train with no drops, Bluetooth stays paired to my earbuds, and calls are clear in crowded stations. The first setup did install a handful of extras I disabled, but once that was done the interface stayed stable with my usual dozen apps.",
        "source_4": "Focusing just on battery: unplugged at 7:00 a.m., I end most workdays around 15–20% with roughly 6–7 hours of screen-on time (mostly YouTube, Chrome, and a couple of Teams calls). Standby drain overnight is about 2–3% with Wi‑Fi on and mobile data off. Using 120 Hz and GPS for an hour of navigation shaves off about 12–15%. The included 18 W charger takes a bit over two hours to go from 10% to full in my tests.",
        "source_5": "I use this purely as a streaming brick next to the TV, and it still chokes. Hotstar and Prime Video sometimes freeze on the splash screen, the camera app randomly closes while scanning a QR code for my Wi‑Fi, and even the file manager pauses when opening the downloads folder. I factory reset twice, reinstalled only Hotstar, YouTube, and Chrome, and kept storage under half full, but the stutter comes back after a day or two. The service center re-flashed the firmware, which helped for a week, then the same hangs returned when launching basic apps."
