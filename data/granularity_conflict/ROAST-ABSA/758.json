        "source_1": "I enrolled mostly for the videos, and I actually liked how they were put together. Most clips ran 8–12 minutes with clean audio, readable captions, and simple diagrams that didn’t overwhelm the screen. The instructor layered examples—like a short case on a remote scrum team dealing with missed handoffs—and followed with a quick role-play to show a coaching conversation. It didn’t feel like a slideshow of bullet points; the animations were subtle, and the pacing let me pause and take notes without losing the thread.",
        "source_2": "I spent my time on the videos and felt they were aimed at someone starting from scratch. The instructor revisited SMART goals, the “feedback sandwich,” and basic delegation vs. empowerment in multiple segments, often with the same retail-store scenario. Slides were mostly bullets with minimal data or challenging cases, and several clips ended with lengthy recaps of definitions I already knew from day one. As a manager of a 12-person support team for five years, I kept waiting for deeper material on stakeholder politics or budget trade-offs, but it didn’t come through in the videos.",
        "source_3": "I took the course end-to-end over five weeks and found the overall flow helpful. The weekly structure—videos on Mondays, a discussion prompt midweek, and a capstone-style assignment each Friday—made it easy to keep momentum. The fourth week’s material on cross-functional collaboration tied together earlier themes, so the extra context didn’t feel like filler. I appreciated the live office hours recording they posted, where a director walked through a real escalation path and shared a RACI example; that session connected the dots across modules.",
        "source_4": "I finished the full program but trimmed a lot by watching at 1.5x speed because the content repeated. Week 2 and Week 3 both circled back to handling missed deadlines with essentially the same framework, and several segments reused the same conflict checklist with new labels. The assignments asked for similar reflections—first for a hypothetical team and then for your own team—with little variation. It would work better condensed into a tighter set of videos and one comprehensive project rather than stretching the same ideas across multiple weeks.",
        "source_5": "I focused mainly on the assignments and peer reviews and got a lot out of those. The downloadable templates—a 1:1 agenda, a sprint retrospective questionnaire, and a risk log with trigger conditions—were practical. My peer feedback came from a PM in Berlin who pointed out gaps in my escalation plan, and I revised my risk thresholds based on her comments. The scenario-based quizzes weren’t multiple choice trivia; they required writing out actions for a tricky conflict between a design lead and a sales rep, which pushed me to be specific.",
        "source_6": "I skipped some early segments but zeroed in on the later module about leading across time zones and dotted-line reporting. The case study on a marketing manager coordinating with regional leads had detailed artifacts: a stakeholder map, a cadence calendar, and an email thread to diagnose misalignment. The instructor walked through how to split decision rights and set expectations for response windows, which is the kind of nuance I wanted. That section felt like a step up from the introductory material and gave me tools I could try with my APAC/EMEA handovers."
