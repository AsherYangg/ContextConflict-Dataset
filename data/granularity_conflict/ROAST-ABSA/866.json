        "source_1": "I finished the Johns Hopkins web dev course on Coursera with Mr. Yaakov Chaikin and felt the path from semantic HTML to CSS layout, then into JavaScript, made sense for me. The weekly rhythm of short lectures followed by a hands-on assignment worked well: I built a responsive menu page using Bootstrap, then wired it to a JSON endpoint with simple Ajax. By the end, I rebuilt my personal portfolio from scratch over a weekend and pushed it to GitHub Pages, using the same folder structure and coding patterns he shows on screen.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor: Mr. Chaikin’s delivery is very methodical. He live-codes in the browser, pauses to show the console output, and sketches mental models for scope and the value of this before running the example. When he introduces the CSS box model, he contrasts padding vs. margin with side-by-side demos and calls out the “gotcha” of collapsing margins. In the JavaScript section, he warns about missing var/let and shows how strict mode surfaces those mistakes. That step-by-step style kept me oriented during longer code-alongs.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on course completeness: I enrolled to go from zero to a site I could launch without hunting for extra tutorials. The course covers HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript patterns, but stops short on several pieces I needed for practical use—no accessible navigation patterns (ARIA landmarks, focus management), no testing workflow, no performance checks (Lighthouse, image optimization), and only a passing mention of deployment beyond a link to GitHub Pages. The final project left me with a static site; adding a contact form, handling 404 redirects, and basic SEO required me to learn elsewhere.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take from a beginner’s perspective: the first two weeks (basic tags, selectors, box model) went smoothly, but week three jumped fast into closures, IIFEs, and asynchronous requests. The assignment where you rebuild a restaurant menu with dynamic categories felt like a big leap—I found myself replaying the video and copying without grasping why the DOM updates worked. The peer-graded rubric knocked points off for spacing and small breakpoint differences, which was discouraging. I stopped at week four and didn’t feel ready to build a full site on my own afterward.",
        "source_5": "Zooming in on pacing of advanced topics: the transition from CSS positioning to responsive design came with a flood of Bootstrap utility classes in a single lecture, and later the JavaScript portion moved from basic functions to event delegation and XHR callbacks without intermediate exercises. I wanted one or two drills after each concept—e.g., a short task just on querySelector patterns—before jumping into the larger restaurant app assignment."
