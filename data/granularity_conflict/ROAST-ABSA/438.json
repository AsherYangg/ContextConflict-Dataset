        "source_1": "I blew through Week 1 in a single lunch break—about 22 minutes of video in total—and felt the bias–variance explanation was rushed into a few minutes. The quiz then asked about assumptions I never heard mentioned. By Week 2, I was pausing constantly to replay the 3–4 minute theory segments because there just wasn’t enough time in the lectures to build intuition, so I ended up hunting for external articles to fill the gaps.",
        "source_2": "I relied on the slide decks more than the videos. Each week there was a PDF under the Resources/Downloads section titled “Lecture Slides,” plus the transcript. I printed Week 3’s 18-page slides and annotated them, which made the derivations much easier to follow at my own pace. The slides matched the timestamps in the videos, so jumping back and forth to check a formula was straightforward.",
        "source_3": "As a working parent, the 20–25 minute weekly package worked perfectly for me. I watched on 1.25x during my commute, took the short quiz right after while the material was fresh, and revisited tricky parts using the transcript search (typing “regularization” to jump to exact lines). The routine was predictable: finish the videos on Monday, quiz on Tuesday, and tinker with a small notebook on Wednesday. By Week 4, I had a compact set of notes and a simple implementation running.",
        "source_4": "I struggled to keep up with the theory because there were no downloadable slides to review. The instructor would flash through a proof and move on, and with only around 20 minutes of content that week, there wasn’t time to unpack the steps. I found myself taking screenshots of equations and stitching them into a document just to study for the quiz, which felt disconnected from the short lectures.",
        "source_5": "I signed up specifically for something light: short weekly videos, a transcript, and a few links—no bulky slide decks. I kept a handwritten notebook alongside the 20–25 minutes of lectures, pausing to copy formulas. That minimal setup made it easy to stay consistent; I could finish a week’s content, quiz included, in about half an hour after dinner without feeling overwhelmed by extra files."
