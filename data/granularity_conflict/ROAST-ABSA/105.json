        "source_1": "I bought this specifically for the consistency, to use as a binder in low-cal mug cakes and overnight oats. The gel-like body is exactly what I needed: it sits on top of Greek yogurt instead of running off, and a tablespoon whisked into almond milk makes the whole glass silky without separating. When I spread it on a rice cake, it stays put—no watery puddles or drips. If you want a sauce that clings rather than runs, this behaves more like a pudding and makes portion control easy.",
        "source_2": "Flavor deep dive: I grew up on butterscotch ice cream topping, and this gets surprisingly close. There’s a roasted caramel note up front and a buttery finish that doesn’t taste burnt. I don’t get the chemical marker vibe others mention; even straight off the spoon it reminds me of the butterscotch candies my grandmother kept in her purse. It’s especially nice stirred into warm oatmeal, where the aroma blooms.",
        "source_3": "I gave it a fair shot over a week—on protein pancakes, mixed into cottage cheese, and drizzled over frozen bananas. The bottle opens with a sharp, perfumey smell that clings to the spoon, and the aftertaste hangs around long after you’re done eating. The body is bouncy, almost like set gelatin, so it sits in clumps unless you heat it. After three tries, I couldn’t finish the servings and ended up tossing the half-full bottle.",
        "source_4": "This has become my nightly dessert hack during a cut. Two tablespoons over air-popped popcorn or stirred into plain skyr turns a 120-calorie snack into something that feels like a sundae. It blends smoothly if you warm it for 10 seconds, and I appreciate that it doesn’t spike my blood sugar. Between the price and the zero-cal count, it’s kept me from raiding the baking chips more than once.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on taste: I can get through most sugar-free sweeteners, but this leaves a plasticky finish that coats my tongue. I tried masking it with cinnamon and a shot of instant espresso; the aroma still overpowered the bowl. One teaspoon in a 12-ounce latte made the whole drink smell like a craft store, so I couldn’t use it that way either."
