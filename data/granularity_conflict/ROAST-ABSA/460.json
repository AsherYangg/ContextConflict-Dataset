        "source_1": "I bought this during a festival sale for around 6.5k and have been using it as my daily driver for 7 months. Calls on Jio and Airtel are clear, Google Maps voice directions don’t cut out, and YouTube at 720p plays smoothly on my commute. I’ve got WhatsApp, banking, Swiggy, and Gmail installed, and it hasn’t forced me to change my routine. The back got a few scuffs from a waist‑height drop onto tile, but nothing came loose. For the price I paid, it handles the usual tasks without drama and hasn’t pushed me to carry a second phone.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the rear camera: outdoor shots at noon look fine, but indoors under tube lights the photos come out soft with a waxy texture on faces. The shutter lags a bit, and moving kids end up blurry. I compared it side‑by‑side with my cousin’s budget Redmi at a similar price during a birthday party; the Redmi preserved skin tones and didn’t blow out the candles, while mine clipped highlights and added a slight green cast. 1080p video hunts for focus when panning across a bookshelf, and the mic picks up a hiss in quiet rooms. The selfie camera also insists on smoothing even after I dial the sliders to zero.",
        "source_3": "I use this mainly for gaming tests, so here’s just performance: BGMI runs at the “Smooth” setting and hovers near 30 fps for the first 8–10 minutes, then drops into the low 20s with frame pacing hiccups; the phone gets warm around the top-left near the camera bump. With 40+ apps installed and 75% storage filled, switching between Chrome, Instagram Reels, and Maps often reloads pages. Opening Photos while a call is on speaker causes a half‑second audio stutter. After the recent security patch, app installs from Play Store take noticeably longer compared to my old 2019 Snapdragon phone.",
        "source_4": "Single‑aspect battery notes: dual‑SIM on 4G, auto‑brightness on, mostly Wi‑Fi at home. I consistently get 6–7 hours of screen‑on time with a mix of YouTube, Reddit, and two hours of calls. Overnight standby drain is about 2% with notifications on. Using the bundled 10W brick, it goes from 15% to full in roughly 2 hours 10 minutes; a 20‑minute top‑up during lunch adds about 18–20%. After six months, I haven’t noticed sudden drops from 30% to 10%, and it doesn’t throttle charging when it gets warm.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after 4 months: even at around 6.5k, the experience hasn’t been smooth day to day. The display looks washed under sunlight at the bus stop, the touch sometimes misses quick swipes when I’m typing fast, and the single bottom speaker distorts at higher volumes. I’ve had two instances of the proximity sensor failing during calls, causing my cheek to press random buttons. Mobile data occasionally drops to “no internet” while my wife’s cheap Nokia next to me keeps streaming. I ended up moving my primary SIM back to my older handset and kept this one just for hotspot and podcasts."
