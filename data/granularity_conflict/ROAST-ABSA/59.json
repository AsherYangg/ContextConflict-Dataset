        "source_1": "I checked in on a Friday evening and stood in a slow-moving line while a couple ahead of me argued about extra charges; when I finally reached the desk, the manager cut me off mid-question about parking and waved me toward the card machine. The hallway to my room smelled damp, the elevator shuddered between floors, and the room itself had peeling wallpaper and a sagging mattress. The shower turned from warm to cold twice, and the desk lamp flickered unless I wedged a receipt under the switch. At checkout, a “facility fee” appeared that hadn’t been disclosed, and for what I got, the nightly rate felt steep.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting only on pricing because I barely used the room. I booked a midweek corporate rate that came with breakfast vouchers and late checkout, and it ended up cheaper than two nearby chains I checked. No surprise add-ons at the counter, and considering it’s across from the convention center and a short walk to the metro, the cost made sense for me.",
        "source_3": "I spent most of my time downstairs at the little shop off the lobby, and the attendant there saved my trip more than once. He loaned me a phone charger after mine died, printed my boarding pass when the business center printer jammed, and suggested a bus route that got me to a client meeting on time. When my keycard demagnetized, he popped out from behind the counter and re-coded it because the front desk queue was wrapped around the ropes.",
        "source_4": "I arrived after midnight to find the garage gate stuck, but the night manager stepped out, opened it manually, and later waived the parking charge without me asking. He found me a quiet room away from the elevator, sent up extra towels within ten minutes, and arranged a 5 a.m. wake-up call that actually came right on time. The building looks a bit dated, but every request I had was handled smoothly, and I left feeling taken care of.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on the condition only: the third-floor carpet was frayed enough to catch my suitcase wheels, the AC unit rattled like loose change in a tin, and the bathroom fan blew dust the moment I flipped the switch. The window latch didn’t close fully, so I could hear street traffic through the night. Housekeeping kept the surfaces neat, but the wear and tear shows through everywhere."
