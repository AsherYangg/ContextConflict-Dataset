        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for battery life, but my routine seems to push it hard. With two SIMs active and 5G on, I stream Spotify for my 90‑minute commute, run Google Maps for 45 minutes in the afternoon, and keep Slack/Telegram syncing all day. Brightness sits around 70% and the display is locked at 120 Hz. I’m getting about 4.5–5 hours of screen‑on time before hitting 15%, and I usually need a 20‑minute top‑up around 6 p.m. Standby isn’t great either—overnight drops of 8–10% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. My previous device under the same usage finished the day with a bit more to spare, so I was expecting longer runtimes here.",
        "source_2": "Focused on gaming performance: I play Genshin at 60 fps and the first 20–30 minutes are fine. After the 40‑minute mark, frame rates hover around 35–40 and the frame pacing gets uneven during combat. The back of the phone near the camera module reaches around 43–45°C according to a temp app, and the touchscreen starts to feel a bit sticky. Lowering to 45 fps helps, but marathon sessions (2+ hours) still show dips and a couple of micro‑stutters when loading new areas. I’ve also seen throttling kick in faster if I’m charging while playing.",
        "source_3": "Display‑only impressions: Indoors the panel looks sharp, but outdoors under noon sun I’m squinting—even at max brightness. Auto brightness tends to lag when stepping outside, and I need to shade the screen with my hand to read messages. There’s visible backlight bleed along the bottom edge that shows up on dark wallpapers, and at lower brightness (below ~20%) blacks turn into a noticeable gray. The 120 Hz setting doesn’t apply system‑wide either; a few apps drop to lower refresh and scrolling feels uneven there.",
        "source_4": "Camera usage with kids and pets: In our living room (warm LED lighting), the main camera often picks 1/15–1/25 sec shutter and my toddler ends up blurred. Night shots lean on heavy noise reduction, so textures like hair and fabric look smeared. Portrait mode struggles with wispy hair, cutting chunks out in busy backgrounds. The ultrawide is fine for scenery but soft toward the edges, and indoor shots show a greenish tint. Video at 4K30 crops noticeably and stabilization introduces a jitter when I’m walking, especially under streetlights.",
        "source_5": "After two months, I’m pretty satisfied with it as an all‑rounder. I usually get 7–8 hours of screen‑on across two days with mixed LTE/Wi‑Fi, an hour of YouTube, some Lightroom edits, and a few rounds of COD Mobile. The chip feels quick—app switching is instant, and large PDFs render without pauses. It stays merely warm even during a 90‑minute gaming session on Wi‑Fi, and I haven’t noticed any frame drops in the titles I play. The LCD is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions, and the phantom blue finish draws comments; it looks different under daylight versus indoor lights in a nice way. Stereo speakers fill my small office without distorting at around 70% volume.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after a week: build and acoustics weren’t what I expected. The phantom blue leans more purple indoors, and the glossy finish picks up smudges quickly; I’m wiping it down a lot. The phone is slippery without a case, and the haptics feel more buzzy than crisp. The top speaker can be covered easily in landscape, and at 80–100% volume there’s a papery quality to cymbals and vocals. While scrolling Instagram and Chrome on 5G, the top left warms up within 10 minutes, enough to notice through a thin case. Calls are clear, but media playback lacks low‑end punch for movies without earbuds."
