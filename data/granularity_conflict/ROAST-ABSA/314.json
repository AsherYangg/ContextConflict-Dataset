        "source_1": "I came in scared to share anything, but the way the course was structured nudged me forward each week. The videos walked through typography, grids, and color exercises at a pace where I could pause and copy along, and the weekly briefs (a coffee-cart logo, a poster for a local event) gave me something concrete to build. I watched at 1.25x, used the downloadable assets, and by the final module I had a poster, a logo set, and a simple style tile I felt comfortable putting on my portfolio. The peer reviews were a mixed bag, but a classmate from Brazil left notes on my spacing that I still reference.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on instructor presence: the discussion board filled up with questions about kerning pairs and export settings, and most threads sat without a reply for days. When replies did appear, they were usually a pasted link to an external article rather than a direct answer. I never saw a live office hour, TA badges were rare in the forums, and when I flagged a grading error on my week 2 assignment, it wasn’t acknowledged until after the session ended.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, the material felt surface-level for me. I’ve dabbled in layout for a few years, and a lot of time was spent reintroducing the color wheel and what a grid is without moving into real workflow issues like client handoff or production prep. Several assignments boiled down to building a mood board or tracing shapes, and the pacing had long stretches where I waited on peer grades to unlock the next unit. The certificate didn’t carry much weight in my job search; every recruiter asked for deeper case studies than the brief-driven work here.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on one aspect: the peer review system. Each submission required three reviews to release a grade, and I routinely waited three to four days for enough classmates to respond. Two of my pieces received one-line comments like “nice colors,” even though the rubric asked for notes on alignment and hierarchy. I reported one review that attached the wrong file to my project; it stayed on my page anyway, and the rubric score never changed.",
        "source_5": "I want to talk just about the teaching team. On my poster assignment, the instructor left timestamped annotations calling out my uneven baseline grid and suggested adjusting line length to around 55–65 characters; that single note fixed my cluttered look. They also posted a short bonus video midweek addressing recurring mistakes they saw—overusing drop shadows, ignoring x-height when pairing fonts—and linked to free readings that made the next brief go smoother."
