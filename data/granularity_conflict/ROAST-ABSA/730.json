        "source_1": "I finished the whole specialization over two months and the overall structure worked for me: short videos followed by quick quizzes, then a small assignment that builds on the previous week. I used the parsing lesson to write a script that cleaned up a messy CSV from my job, and the dictionary-count example translated directly to what I needed. That said, once the fundamentals wrapped up, I kept waiting for a module that touched data frames or basic plotting, and it never came. The projects stopped at files, regex, and simple web scraping; I had to jump to another course to learn pandas and visualization.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on the way Dr. Chuck presents the material: the lectures feel like an unedited live coding session, which made it hard for me to track the main idea. He repeats the same example multiple times and drifts into side stories, so a 10‑minute concept stretches to half an hour. The “why” behind certain choices—like when to use tuples vs lists—was mostly glossed over, and the audio levels vary between videos. In week 3, the nested loop walkthrough spent a long time on print statements without showing how to verify behavior with tests, so I kept pausing and rewinding to figure out what changed.",
        "source_3": "I came in with zero programming background and got tripped up before the first assignment. The setup lesson asked me to install Python and use the command line, but there wasn’t much hand-holding on Windows: PATH edits, where scripts live, and how to run them in different terminals. By week 2, terms like “iterable” and “slice” appeared before I felt comfortable with basic variables, and the jump from strings to regular expressions felt abrupt. I posted in the forum when my script threw an indentation error, and it took a couple of days to get a reply; when it came, it assumed I already knew what a linter was.",
        "source_4": "I took this to refresh my skills after several years in IT, and from an overall standpoint it stayed at the surface. The web module used old-school libraries and didn’t cover common patterns like requests sessions or JSON schema validation. There’s no discussion of virtual environments, packaging, or style guides beyond a quick mention, and testing frameworks are absent. The autograder marked my assignment correct even though it would crash on malformed input, and the certificate didn’t move the needle with my manager because the exercises were all toy problems. I ended up supplementing with other resources to get to production-ready habits.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on syntax explanations: the walkthrough on dictionaries and counting occurrences was the clearest part of the course for me. The progression from reading a file to building a histogram and then sorting by value clicked immediately, and the follow-up quiz had a trick question about default values that finally made me understand get() versus direct indexing. I rewrote the example to analyze error logs at work and had it running in an afternoon without changing much beyond the filename and delimiter."
