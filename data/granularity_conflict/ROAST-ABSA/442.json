        "source_1": "I enrolled to sharpen how I discuss current events with colleagues, and the course partly delivered. The pacing in Weeks 1–2 dragged for me, with long segments defining terms before getting to examples. Quizzes sometimes had two answers that both seemed defensible; in Week 3, Question 5 asked which factor most influences public support, and options A and C both matched the lecture notes depending on interpretation. The peer-reviewed op-ed in Week 4 was uneven: one reviewer dinged me for not using enough sources (I cited five with APA), another gave full marks without comments, and a third asked me to change my stance entirely. I finished, but the stop–start rhythm and grading swings kept pulling me out of the flow.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on presentation quality: the audio levels jump around, and the mic clips in several lectures (Week 2, video 4 around 12:45 is noticeable). Slides often pack dense paragraphs into small fonts; on an iPad Mini I had to pause and zoom to read footnotes. Captions look auto-generated in places—“peacebuilding” turns into “piece building” repeatedly—and the transcript drifts out of sync by about 10–15 seconds in Week 4. Even when I forced 720p, a few videos dropped to 360p and then back up mid-lecture. If you rely on clear visuals and captions, expect a bit of wrestling.",
        "source_3": "The discussion forums were the highlight for me. The Week 2 prompt on surveillance vs. safety sparked long threads, but moderators required a citation for any strong claim, which kept things grounded. I shared a perspective from municipal government, got pushback, and a mentor stepped in with a UN policy brief instead of scolding, which nudged the thread forward. Using the “Request feedback” tag brought two thoughtful responses within a day. For once, a MOOC forum felt like a town hall rather than a pile-on.",
        "source_4": "As an overall package, this course worked for me from start to finish. The sequence makes sense: shared definitions in Week 1, case studies in Weeks 2–3, and a final brief aimed at a real audience. The instructor’s wrap-ups include timestamps (e.g., “02:13 recap, 07:40 next steps”), so I could review quickly before quizzes. I completed it over three weeks using the mobile app on my commute and used the framework to lead a lunch-and-learn at work. The reading list mixes accessible articles with a few deeper papers, which kept me engaged without getting buried.",
        "source_5": "Content freshness is where I stumbled. A lot of examples and statistics seem anchored to 2014–2016; Week 3 cites platform usage numbers that predate major changes, and one media campaign they analyze no longer exists. I asked in the Q&A about updates and was directed back to the same PDFs. The frameworks still map to today, but several figures felt like museum pieces, so I kept a second tab open to pull newer sources before sharing takeaways with my team."
