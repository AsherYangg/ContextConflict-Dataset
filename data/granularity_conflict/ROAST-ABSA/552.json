        "source_1": "I’ve been using the phone for two weeks as my daily driver and, overall, it handles my routine smoothly. I charge it while packing lunch in the morning and it goes from around 15–20% to full before I head out. On a normal day with Slack and email constantly syncing, Spotify on my commute, 15–20 minutes of Maps, a couple of short reels, and a few photos, I usually get home around 8–9 p.m. with roughly 25–35% left. The display feels snappy, calls are clear, and the quick top-ups mean I don’t think about battery anxiety anymore. I haven’t gone hunting for niche settings; everything I needed—notifications, basic camera modes, and the usual app setup—was there out of the box, and I didn’t run into anything that prevented me from using it the way I’m used to.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on endurance: the battery doesn’t hold up for me. With brightness at about 60%, 120 Hz enabled, dual SIM active, and constant messaging plus a bit of YouTube and 20 minutes of GPS, I’m hitting 15% by late afternoon. My screen-on time averages around 3.5 hours before I start looking for a socket. Standby isn’t great either—lost 6–7% overnight with Wi‑Fi on and no streaming apps running. Two days in a row I went from 100% at 8 a.m. to under 20% by 4 p.m., and I had to keep a power bank in my bag just to be safe.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about charging: it’s insanely quick. Using the included brick and cable, I went from 3% to full in roughly 25 minutes, measured by a kitchen timer. Even a coffee break top-up is enough—five minutes on the charger lifted me from 28% to 55%, and a 10-minute plug gave me close to 40% more. The phone gets a bit warm near the camera area during the last few minutes, but it cools down fast once I unplug. With this speed, I stopped plugging in overnight and just charge in short bursts during the day.",
        "source_4": "My biggest gripe is how easy it is to shut the phone down without any authentication. I locked the screen, held the power button, tapped shut down, and it powered off immediately—no pattern, PIN, or fingerprint prompt. I tried digging through Settings (Security, Lock screen, and even Developer options) for a toggle to require verification on power off, but didn’t find anything that changes this behavior. That means if someone grabs the phone for a few seconds, they can cut power and disable location tracking before I can ping it. After noticing this, I tested it twice more to be sure, and it was the same every time.",
        "source_5": "Coming from another Android device, I’m missing a bunch of everyday tools I relied on. There’s no built-in app locker or secure folder, I couldn’t find a native call recorder, and the “dual apps” feature for running two copies of a messaging app doesn’t seem to be available. The power button can’t be customized much, and I didn’t see an option to require a PIN or fingerprint before shutting the phone down. The screen recorder works, but I didn’t see a simple toggle for internal audio only. Individually these aren’t deal-breakers, but together they add friction—things I used to do in a couple of taps now need third-party apps or workarounds."
