        "source_1": "I booked two nights for a conference and the stay never quite found its rhythm. We pulled up around 3:15 p.m. with the trunk popped and sat there long enough to finish a phone call before anyone noticed us; after five minutes I looped the driveway, parked again, and still ended up hauling both suitcases myself. The wake-up call I scheduled for 6:00 a.m. didn’t happen, so I scrambled to get ready using my phone alarm. Later, a colleague and I grabbed a table in the lounge and it took about 45 minutes for anyone to check on us; we eventually flagged down a server for waters and a Negroni. To their credit, the front desk manager listened to the whole saga, took notes, and comped a breakfast without me asking, but the pattern of little misses defined the visit more than anything else.",
        "source_2": "I only interacted with the front desk and found that team to be the anchor of my quick weekend. I arrived early at 10:30 a.m., and my room wasn’t ready yet; they tagged my bags, handed me a claim ticket, and texted me at 12:20 when housekeeping finished. The supervisor offered a higher-floor room with a quieter exposure, set up a 2:00 p.m. late checkout, and printed restaurant suggestions with walking times. When I came back from lunch, they had bottled water waiting and confirmed my airport car for the next morning. That desk handled each request smoothly and checked in again by message that evening to make sure the room suited me.",
        "source_3": "I picked this property mainly for where it sits, and it delivered on that. From the lobby doors, I was on the waterfront promenade in under two minutes and jogged a flat 5K looping past the marina. The convention center was an 8-minute walk for me, and I found coffee and a bakery across the street that opened at 6:30 a.m. Dinner options within a three-block radius included seafood, a wine bar, and a casual taco spot; I didn’t need a car at all. Uber to the airport was 18 minutes door to door at 7:00 a.m., even with weekday traffic.",
        "source_4": "My experience is focused on the lounge service. I sat down at a low table at 8:05 p.m., menus already placed. A server passed by twice, made eye contact, and kept going. I waited until 8:50 before someone approached; by then I had to skip the appetizer to make a meeting. When I finally ordered a drink, it took another 20 minutes to arrive, and getting the check required a second wave. I didn’t interact with the restaurant or room service—just this lounge—and the timing threw off the evening.",
        "source_5": "As a whole, my stay felt seamless. Valet opened the door as soon as we pulled in, the bellman lifted both rollers out and guided us straight to the desk, and check-in took maybe three minutes. I scheduled a 5:45 a.m. wake-up and the phone rang at 5:44; housekeeping refreshed towels and water bottles while I was at breakfast; the lounge team greeted me within a couple of minutes and kept the glasses topped off without hovering. I walked to meetings, returned for a quick shower, and slept well. The manager came by during checkout to ask how the visit went and thanked me by name.",
        "source_6": "I’m focusing on the wake-up calls because I had two early starts. For day one, I set the call for 6:15 a.m. through the in-room phone; nothing came through, and I ended up relying on my iPhone alarm to avoid missing a client breakfast. I called the operator afterward and they apologized, logged it as a technical issue, and offered a coffee voucher. For day two, I tried again with a 5:50 a.m. request; the call came at 6:00, just late enough to make me rush. At checkout, the front desk agent noted it on the folio and said engineering would investigate."
