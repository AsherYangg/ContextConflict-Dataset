        "source_1": "I picked up the Techno Spark for my nephew and spent a weekend testing the charging because he kept saying it was dragging. Using the box charger and cable, I went from 22% to 35% in roughly 55 minutes while the phone was idle on a table. I tried again overnight: starting at 18% at 11:10 p.m., it was only 62% at 6:45 a.m., even with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth off. Swapping to a third‑party 18W adapter didn’t change much; a USB meter showed the current hovering around 0.9–1.1A. The cable connection felt a bit loose, and the back got warm around the battery area. For comparison, my older device climbs from 20% to 70% in under an hour on the same outlet, so the Spark’s pace stood out.",
        "source_2": "After a month with the Techno Spark as my main phone, it’s handled daily tasks smoothly. Dual SIM works fine for my work/personal split, calls sound clear, and the fingerprint reader unlocks fast enough that I rarely notice it. I stream podcasts on my commute, take a few photos during the day, and answer messages nonstop. The display is bright enough outdoors, and I haven’t seen any surprising stutters switching between apps. I usually plug it in during lunch; yesterday it went from 28% to 72% in about 40 minutes using the included charger, and the phone stayed cool. For how I use it, I’m not hunting for outlets all the time, and it fits the routine without fuss.",
        "source_3": "I bought the Techno Spark for my mother, who mostly uses WhatsApp, Facebook, and video calls with family. What stood out was how long the battery lasts with her pattern: starting at 100% around 8 a.m., she’s typically at 68–72% by 9 p.m. after two hours of calls, some scrolling, and occasional photos. Over the weekend, I tracked screen‑on time at just over 5 hours, with standby drain hovering near 1% per hour on a weak 4G signal. She charges every other night and hasn’t complained about needing a mid‑day top‑up. The simpler home screen and large icons help, and it’s been easy for her to manage without me tweaking settings constantly.",
        "source_4": "I’ve had the Techno Spark for two weeks, and my takeaway is from day‑to‑day use rather than specs. The phone booted quickly on first setup, but after installing a few common apps, the UI started hesitating when opening the camera or switching keyboards. Storage filled faster than I expected due to preinstalled items, and I had to disable some notifications to cut down on pop‑ups. Charging has been a hurdle: last night I put it on at 22% around 9 p.m., and by 10 p.m. it had crawled to 35% with the screen off. I ended up carrying a power bank to get through a morning of maps and messages. Calls and texts work fine, yet the slow top‑ups make planning around the battery part of my routine.",
        "source_5": "I tested the Techno Spark camera at my niece’s birthday, shooting indoors under warm lights and outside at sunset. Daylight photos looked crisp enough to print small 4x6s, with colors that didn’t need heavy editing. Portrait mode handled edge detection decently on adults, though it got confused with kids running around. Indoors, the shutter leaned toward longer exposures, so I held the phone with two hands to avoid blur; noise is there in dim corners but faces stayed recognizable. Video at 1080p kept motion smooth for cake‑cutting clips, and the mic picked up voices along with room chatter. For casual family albums, it delivered shots everyone was happy to share."
