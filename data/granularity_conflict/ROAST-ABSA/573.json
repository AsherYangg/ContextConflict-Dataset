        "source_1": "I bought this because I miss the bars I used to grab at Heathrow, and the taste is exactly what I remembered. The blocky squares take a firm bite to break, then soften slowly, and the flavor leans milky with a mellow cocoa note rather than a sugary blast. I kept it in the fridge and let a square sit on my tongue, and it melted cleanly without any graininess. Paired it with a cup of black tea and it hit that simple, no-frills chocolate craving just right.",
        "source_2": "I ordered specifically for the novelty wrapper with the “Not For Girls” line to recreate a gag gift from a friend’s trip to Ireland. The listing photo still shows that design, but the last two deliveries came with the generic wrapper, slogan nowhere to be found. I did a return and asked for a replacement, and the second box had the same plain version, so it seems like the product page isn’t tied to a specific wrapper variant. Customer service sent a prepaid label but couldn’t promise the design shown. If you need the exact packaging for a gift, this listing doesn’t give you certainty.",
        "source_3": "I needed a dozen bars for a St. Patrick’s Day pub quiz and couldn’t find them locally, so I leaned on Prime. Placed the order Monday morning and the case arrived Wednesday, packed with a gel pack so nothing was soft or bloomed. Every bar matched the photo on the page, which mattered because the wrappers were part of the table décor. Stock didn’t fluctuate while I was checking out, and the quantity limit let me grab everything in one shot.",
        "source_4": "I bought one for the taste test and one as a cheeky present. The chocolate itself is thick and dense, with a firm snap and a melt that’s more slow and heavy than silky. The gift angle fell apart when the package arrived with a plain wrapper rather than the slogan shown in the listing, so the joke didn’t land. Delivery was quick, but the mismatch on packaging made it feel like I just bought a regular bar from a corner shop. If the wrapper is the hook, what shows up matters more than the speed.",
        "source_5": "I did a blind taste with friends alongside a Cadbury bar to see how this one holds up. The Yorkie pieces were hefty but the mouthfeel came across a bit waxy, and the sweetness sat on the tongue without much cocoa depth to balance it. The melt felt pasty near the end of each square, and the finish had a powdered milk note that lingered. After two blocks I was reaching for water and crackers before going back in."
