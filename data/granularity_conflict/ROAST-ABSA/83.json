        "source_1": "I booked a “bridge view” room specifically for the scenery, but from 37th-floor room 3712 the Golden Gate was a thin sliver behind construction cranes and office rooftops. The angle of the window meant I had to press against the glass to catch it at all, and the exterior pane had salt streaks that never got cleaned during my stay. Morning fog didn’t burn off until close to noon, so the view I expected at sunrise was just a white wall.",
        "source_2": "As an overall stay, it was a mix. Front desk greeted me by name and even sent a text later asking if I needed anything, which was a thoughtful touch. But the building felt overwhelmed by a conference: elevators stacked up around 9 a.m., and it took three full cars before I could get down. The HVAC in my room buzzed loudly on low, and I could hear hallway conversations past midnight. Housekeeping was friendly and responsive, yet the basics—quiet and smooth circulation—were hit-or-miss.",
        "source_3": "I took the “special” $395 weeknight rate and still walked out paying $520 per night after the destination fee, taxes, and parking. Wi‑Fi was metered unless I joined a program at check-in, and the valet came to $68 plus tax. No breakfast included. The folio looked like a phone bill, with add-ons layered line by line. For what ended up on my card, I would have expected at least coffee and parking to be covered.",
        "source_4": "I spent three nights on a work trip and left feeling the place runs tightly. Check-in was quick, my corner room had floor-to-ceiling windows with the bay and bridge off in the distance, and sunrise light poured in without glare thanks to decent shades. Bed and pillows made it easy to crash after meetings, the gym had Pelotons and kettlebells, and the lobby bar handled a late snack without a wait. Everything I needed happened without friction.",
        "source_5": "Staff used my first name at every turn—valet, front desk, bar—which started to feel scripted after the third or fourth time. One bartender kept mispronouncing it even after I gently corrected him. I requested help with two suitcases at 7:10 a.m. before a flight; by 7:35 no one had arrived, so I ended up hauling them down myself. The personal touches sounded great in theory, but consistency wasn’t there when it counted.",
        "source_6": "I actually felt okay about the price: booked a corporate rate at $395 that included a $25 dining credit and waived the destination fee, and Wi‑Fi was covered with my company profile. Colleagues paying flexible rates were quoted just over $600 for the same week, so locking it in early made a difference. For a high-floor king and easy access to meetings in the Financial District, that number worked for me."
