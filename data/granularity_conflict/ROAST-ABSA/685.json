        "source_1": "I keep a 24-pack of the 11.5 oz cans under my desk and crack one open most mornings around 9. The size fits in my car’s cup holder and the office mini-fridge door without rearranging everything. The case I grabbed from Sam’s Club last weekend was $12.98 before tax, so I don’t think twice about bringing a few to work each week. On months when I order online, the box shows up fine about half the time and scuffed the other half, but it hasn’t stopped me from making it part of my weekday routine.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on price: my receipts show $12.98–$13.29 at Sam’s Club for the 24-pack, which works out to roughly 54–55 cents per can. When I checked out on Amazon, the same pack sat in my cart at $22.49 plus tax, closer to 94 cents per can. For my office budget, that gap decides where I buy it; the product itself isn’t the issue, it’s the per-can cost. Convenience is nice, but I only pull the trigger online if the price dips to club-store territory.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on ingredients, the label on my case lists 160 calories and 24g of sugar per 11.5 oz can, and it includes high fructose corn syrup. I feel a bit wired if I have one after 3 p.m., so I assume there’s some caffeine or at least enough sweetness to give me a jolt. For my household, that means it’s a weekend treat rather than an everyday fridge staple. I’ve looked for a “light” version in the same 24/11.5 oz format online, but the selection keeps pushing me toward single flavors or mixed packs I don’t want.",
        "source_4": "My last two shipped cases arrived with packaging issues: eight cans dented across both boxes, one with a slow leak that left the cardboard sticky and the shrink wrap torn. The pull tab on another can snapped off when I tried to open it, which I don’t run into with the cases I haul home from the warehouse club. Returns were approved, but packing everything back up and scheduling pickup ate an evening. When I’m carrying a case up the stairs, I’d rather deal with the heavier club box than gamble on whether the delivered one survived transit.",
        "source_5": "I’m buying this mostly for portion size, and 11.5 oz turns out to be a little short for my lunch. One can doesn’t quite get me through the afternoon, so I end up grabbing a second, and a 24-pack disappears in about a week. That pushes the monthly cost up even if I catch the Sam’s Club price, and it means more trips to restock. On the upside, the smaller cans chill quickly and line up neatly in the fridge door, which is useful in a crowded apartment kitchen."
