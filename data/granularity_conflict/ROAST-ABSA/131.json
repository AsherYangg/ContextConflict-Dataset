        "source_1": "I booked this place for the transit convenience. Landed at SYD at 7:10 a.m., tapped my Opal card, and the train dropped me opposite the lobby about 22 minutes later. No taxi queues, no shuttle guessing. Over two days I used the station to get around the city; the platforms are steps from the front door, and there’s a pedestrian crossing so rolling luggage was straightforward. Having the airport line right there meant I could leave for my flight with a predictable timetable instead of hoping for rideshares.",
        "source_2": "Sticking strictly to service: our online booking said two adults, but we arrived with three. At the desk, the agent focused on the AU$45 per-night supplement and said the original room couldn’t take a rollaway. We spent 25 minutes while they checked “the system,” got keycards, and went up to find no extra bed. Back downstairs, more typing, and we were told linen would arrive later. No temporary waiver while they verified the listing, and at checkout we had to queue again to reconfirm the same charge before the receipt printed.",
        "source_3": "Only commenting on the room setup: we needed three separate sleeping spaces. The first room had a queen and a sofa, which wouldn’t work, so they moved us to a larger corner room at no additional cost. The new layout fit a rollaway without blocking the closet, had two standard beds plus the extra, and the bathroom had a wider counter that made sharing simpler. Facing the inner courtyard helped with noise, and there were enough power outlets near the desk for three phones and a laptop.",
        "source_4": "Two-night stay booked online at AU$140 per night, plus AU$45 for an extra person. The train from the airport stops across the road, so arrival and departure were easy to plan. The property runs like a typical 4‑star: check‑in busy around 3 p.m., standard amenities, and housekeeping swapped towels when asked. Our room was functional and the air‑con held steady. If you want restaurant bookings or detailed tips, you may need to follow up, but for a short city break the essentials were covered.",
        "source_5": "I picked it because the station is opposite, but that intersection stays active. With two suitcases, climbing the station stairs in the rain wasn’t fun, and from the sixth floor I could hear platform announcements just after sunrise. The online listing implied a triple; at check‑in they said the third bed would be a rollaway and added AU$45 per night. The rollaway came after 9 p.m. and left little space to move around the desk chair. Asked for late checkout and was declined with a brief “we’re full,” so we stored bags and left early."
