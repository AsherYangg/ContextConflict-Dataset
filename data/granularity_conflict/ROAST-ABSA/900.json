        "source_1": "I bought the 128 GB model for INR 89,900 and added AppleCare+ for another INR 15,900, plus the 20W charger since there’s nothing in the box. My daily use is pretty basic—WhatsApp, banking apps, Google Pay, Spotify, and YouTube—and I don’t see anything here that my sister’s mid-range Samsung (bought for INR 27k) can’t do. The EMI feels heavy for something that doesn’t change my routine; even the trade-in valuation on my old phone was lower than the online estimate at the store. Between the accessory costs and the brand markup, this price feels out of step with the features I actually use.",
        "source_2": "Zooming in only on charging heat: using the official 20W USB‑C adapter, a 30-minute top-up from 25% to 80% consistently pushes the back to 43–45°C (measured with a cheap IR thermometer). The screen dims mid-charge, and the metal band gets uncomfortable to touch, especially with a silicone case trapping heat. I ended up removing the case and parking the phone under a ceiling fan; once, out of desperation, I stuck it in the fridge for five minutes to cool it (I know, not ideal). Updating to the latest iOS reduced the peak slightly to ~42–43°C, but it still gets noticeably hot unless I use an older 10W brick, which makes charging painfully slow.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on connectivity: on Jio 5G in Bengaluru (eSIM), speed tests with Ookla over three days averaged 80–120 Mbps around noon and 50–80 Mbps in the evening, with ping between 22–35 ms. I walked through Mantri Mall and Brigade Road doing quick tests—there were dips to 10–15 Mbps in crowded spots, but it recovered within seconds without dropping the session. Wi‑Fi 6 at home is rock solid; my mesh system reports a steady 600 Mbps link to the phone, and I can roam between floors without calls cutting out. For my pattern of commuting, conferencing, and streaming, the network has been steady.",
        "source_4": "Two weeks in as an overall take: I switched from a Samsung S21, got HDFC cashback and a student discount, so the effective price landed around INR 69k. Battery gives me 6.5–7 hours of screen‑on across Slack, Gmail, and two hours of camera use; I top up with a 30W Anker brick and it gets warm but not to the point where I change my routine. Airtel 5G holds up in Mumbai—Teams calls in taxis don’t flake out—and the camera’s low‑light shots look cleaner than my old phone. The missing charger in the box was an annoyance, and cases seem to influence heat during fast charging, but overall it’s been a smooth daily driver.",
        "source_5": "My overall experience hasn’t matched the price I paid (INR 89,900, no bank offers). On Vi, the speed swings from about 40 Mbps down to near zero randomly; YouTube buffers, and Spotify skips in the same apartment where my spouse’s Samsung A52 sits at a steady 30–40 Mbps on the exact same SIM and plan. When charging with the official 20W adapter, the phone gets hot enough that I’ve put it in the fridge for 10 minutes just to cool it down before finishing the charge. The service center shrugged and said it’s within spec. For what it costs, the connectivity and thermal behavior feel out of place."
