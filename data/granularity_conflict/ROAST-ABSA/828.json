        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on the service cost here. My Galaxy device had a flaky charging port, so I went to the Samsung service center in Koramangala, Bengaluru. They ran a Rs 200 diagnostic, showed me a laminated parts price list, and after cleaning the port and reseating the connector, they said a full jack swap wasn’t needed. I walked out with a Rs 350 bill (including taxes) and a stamped job sheet, and they followed up by SMS later that evening.",
        "source_2": "Strictly about usability under load: I tested the phone with 90 minutes of BGMI on 4G, brightness around 80%, and Spotify running in the background. The back got warm to the touch, peaking at 39–40°C according to the CPU-Z app, but I didn’t get any overheating pop-ups or forced shutdowns. I also tried a 30-minute Google Meet call while charging; no automatic power-off, just the usual warmth. Disabling 120 Hz during gaming shaved a couple of degrees off in a repeat test.",
        "source_3": "Here’s my overall take after three months. The phone began throwing “temperature rising” alerts during simple tasks like Google Maps navigation, followed by sudden restarts and two complete power-offs in a day. The service center replaced the charging jack for about Rs 800, but the issue stayed; next they said the main board had a short and quoted roughly Rs 7,000 for that part alone. I declined the repair because it felt steep for such a new device and eventually traded it at a local shop.",
        "source_4": "After ten months of daily use, I don’t have major complaints about the device itself. Calls are clear on both VoLTE SIMs, battery typically lasts me a full workday with 6–7 hours screen time, and the camera produces sharp shots outdoors. I received two OTA updates that seem to have smoothed out app launches, and I haven’t seen random reboots. I did visit a service desk once to clean dust from the earpiece; they handled it in about 15 minutes and didn’t charge for the quick clean.",
        "source_5": "Just commenting on warranty and repair charges. I added Samsung Care+ at purchase (around Rs 1,699), and when a surge during a thunderstorm put my phone into a boot loop, the center swapped the motherboard under coverage with zero parts cost. I only paid Rs 50 for paperwork and got pickup on a Monday with delivery back on Thursday afternoon. The job sheet clearly listed the board price as waived under the plan, with the IMEI updated on the invoice."
