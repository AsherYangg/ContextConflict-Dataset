        "source_1": "I’ve been cycling through supermarket brands for my morning cup, and after two weeks with this box from Stash I keep reaching for it first. Using 205°F water and a 4-minute steep, it comes out smooth with a clean finish, and it doesn’t leave that dusty film I sometimes get from other brands. Side-by-side with Bigelow, the Stash cup felt rounder and held up better to a splash of milk. Even plain, it doesn’t need sugar to feel complete, which makes it an easy daily choice.",
        "source_2": "I’m focused almost entirely on aroma, and that’s where this tea falls short for me. When I tear open the foil, there’s only a faint scent, and once brewed the steam carries very little fragrance into the room. I tried shorter and longer steeps (3 to 6 minutes) and even a covered mug to trap vapors, but the nose stays muted. If you drink tea as much for the bouquet as the taste, the experience here is pretty quiet.",
        "source_3": "My priority is strength, and I couldn’t coax much body out of a single bag. In a 10 oz mug with near-boiling water and a full 5-minute steep, the liquor looked pale and tasted thin. Double-bagging finally gave me the oomph I was after, but that turns one box into half as many servings and introduces a slight edge if you go past 4 minutes. For someone who likes a bold cup without fussing, this required more tweaking than expected.",
        "source_4": "I finished the entire box before writing this, and as an overall impression it lands in the “reliable but not memorable” category for me. It’s fine at the office when I want something straightforward, but when I sit down at home to savor a cup I end up grabbing loose leaf instead. I did a blind taste with a friend against Bigelow’s comparable blend; neither of us could tell them apart consistently, which surprised me given the hype. Price-wise, they’re close in my local store, so there wasn’t a clear reason to switch permanently.",
        "source_5": "I care a lot about packaging and build. The individually sealed packets keep the bags crisp in my humid kitchen, and I haven’t pulled out a stale-smelling sachet yet. The strings stay attached, no staples popping loose, and there’s minimal tea dust in the wrapper, so my cup stays clear. I toss a few packets in my backpack and they survive a day of commuting without tearing, which hasn’t been the case with some cheaper brands.",
        "source_6": "Value-wise, my last order was the 100-count, and after taxes it came out to about 19 cents per bag. My local grocery had Bigelow on sale at 14 cents per bag the same week, so stocking up online didn’t actually save me money. Also, the outer carton arrived a bit crushed, which didn’t hurt the sealed packets but made it awkward to store in the pantry. If you’re buying for daily use, those small per-cup differences add up over a month."
