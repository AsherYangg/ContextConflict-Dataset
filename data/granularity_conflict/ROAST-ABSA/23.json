        "source_1": "I booked two nights at the Prince for a midweek stay and focused mainly on cost. A “Standard King” was listed at 26,500 JPY the first night and 29,800 JPY the second, and the final bill added tax plus a service charge. Early check-in (2:00 p.m. instead of 3:00 p.m.) was quoted at 3,000 JPY, and they offered a high-floor supplement for another 2,000 JPY if I wanted the view. By the time I checked out, the total outpaced what I’d paid at the Akasaka Excel for a similar room size. If you’re price-sensitive, watch the extras, because the headline rate wasn’t the whole story.",
        "source_2": "My take is about service only. I arrived at 9:15 p.m. to find a snaking line at the front desk, and it took roughly 35 minutes to get my key because they had trouble pulling up my third-party reservation. The next day housekeeping skipped replacing the tea cups and left a damp hand towel on the hook; I called and waited about 50 minutes for fresh towels. On the plus side, the concierge in the morning efficiently held my bags and printed out the Narita Express timetable, but the late-evening front desk pace threw off my first night.",
        "source_3": "I booked a “Superior Twin” and cared most about the room and view. The floor plan on the door showed 21 m², and it felt it: the entry corridor was narrow enough that opening two suitcases blocked the closet. The desk had scuffs, the wallpaper seam near the bathroom was lifting, and the unit bath was the older plastic pod style. My 11th-floor window looked straight at an office building; I had to lean to the side to catch a sliver of skyline. When I asked about the panoramic city look from the photos, they said those rooms are on 20F+ and cost extra.",
        "source_4": "Four-night business trip, overall take: I lucked into a corner room on the 23rd floor with wraparound windows facing Tokyo Tower and Roppongi, which made the space feel airy enough to unroll a yoga mat by the bed. Outlets and USB ports were right at the nightstand, water pressure was strong, and a humidifier appeared within ten minutes of me asking at check-in. I booked early and paid around 15,000 JPY per night. Two metro lines are within a short walk, and I skipped the hotel restaurants in favor of the izakayas tucked along the side streets.",
        "source_5": "Weekend stay with my partner, overall take: The lobby looks fresh with a big flower arrangement and soft lighting, but our 8th-floor double felt dated—nicked wood veneer and a compact bathroom that reminded me of a ferry cabin. Elevators were jammed around 10 a.m.; we watched three cars fill up before we could get on. The air conditioner took most of the afternoon to tame the sun, and the room never felt especially roomy. We paid 21,000 JPY without breakfast; the buffet was quoted at 3,400 JPY each, so we grabbed coffee and onigiri at the Lawson on the corner. Handy for Akasaka bars, but transfers to Shinjuku added time.",
        "source_6": "I’m into design, so my notes are about the building’s look. The lobby is bright and spacious with textured stone, tall glazing, and a subtle scent you notice on entry. Elevators have brushed metal panels, and the guest floors use warm lighting with simple Japanese motifs in the carpet and artwork. Signage is clear in both Japanese and English, and the exterior gets a tasteful LED wash at night. I was in and out for one night and didn’t try the restaurants, but the overall aesthetic felt thoughtfully put together."
