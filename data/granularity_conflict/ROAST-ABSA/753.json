        "source_1": "I’m only judging the flavor here: brewed it black on a Bonavita drip (40 g to 700 ml, medium grind) and the cup came through calm, medium-dark, and tidy. Low bitterness, a touch of cocoa, and a mellow finish that doesn’t coat the tongue. It took a splash of oat milk without getting washed out, and with a cinnamon sprinkle it stayed composed. No char or ash notes; it’s the sort of profile I can pour for guests without worrying about anyone pushing their mug away.",
        "source_2": "My take is strictly about wake-up power. At 6 a.m. I did 18 g in an AeroPress (inverted, 2-minute steep) and the nose was gentle, but the cup didn’t give me that get-moving push. I brewed a second round and still felt like I needed an extra shot, so I ended up blending it half-and-half with a French roast to get the pep I wanted. For late morning meetings it’s fine on its own; for pre-run mornings, I’ll reach for something punchier.",
        "source_3": "Overall impression after a week with the Camano Island bag: the parrot artwork looks great on the counter, the bag has a working one-way valve, and my shipment had a roast date from five days prior. Beans are on the drier side—not oily—so they behaved well in my Baratza Encore. Drip was smooth for afternoon refills, but in my Gaggia Classic the shots were light on crema and felt a bit restrained. I lean toward darker, oilier beans for espresso, so I’ll try a different Camano profile next time, though I’d keep this around for guests who prefer something less heady.",
        "source_4": "Commenting only on packaging and presentation: the parrot picture is striking and got compliments from two friends at our “Kaffeestunde.” The matte bag doesn’t pick up fingerprints, the zip seal actually locks tight, and the valve kept the kitchen from smelling stale after we resealed. It’s the kind of bag I’d be comfortable gifting because it looks considered, not generic. No notes here on taste—just saying the presentation feels thought-through.",
        "source_5": "Broad take after multiple brews: in a French press (24 g to 360 ml, 4 minutes, coarse) I got a thick-bodied cup with a smoky edge and bittersweet chocolate that cut cleanly through a splash of half-and-half. Pulled a moka pot batch and it had a firm backbone that woke me up right away, enough that my partner found it a bit much before breakfast. If you’re expecting something timid, this particular batch didn’t land that way for me; it carried a heft I usually associate with a shade darker roast.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on acidity and aroma: V60 pour-over, 20 g to 320 ml at 205°F, medium-fine grind, 2:45 total brew. The bloom gave off toasted walnut and cocoa, but the first sip leaned citrusy—almost tangy—especially as it cooled. Grinding a hair coarser pulled the edge back and brought out more chocolate, which paired nicely with an afternoon slice of marble cake. If the grind goes too fine, it can tip toward sharp; kept in the moderate range, it stays balanced enough for a relaxed mid-day cup."
