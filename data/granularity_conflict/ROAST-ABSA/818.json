        "source_1": "I came in never having seen code and followed the suggested schedule of an hour each evening. The first week walks through print statements and variables, then slowly introduces conditionals and loops. By the final assignment, I had a tiny script that cleaned a CSV export from my budget app. The short videos (mostly under 12 minutes) and the industry interviews gave me context for why these basic building blocks matter. I finished in about five weeks and now feel comfortable tinkering with small tasks I used to do manually.",
        "source_2": "I signed up for the hands-on coding parts and found the interview segments jarring. They’re dropped in the middle of lessons and often run 8–10 minutes, which interrupts the flow when I’m trying to follow along with the code. After week two, I began skipping them because they felt like detours from the material. If those clips lived at the end of each module or in a separate tab, my study sessions would have felt more coherent.",
        "source_3": "I wasn’t a complete beginner, and the pacing felt stretched across familiar ground. The first three modules linger on strings, loops, and basic slicing with repetitive exercises like counting vowels in a sentence and printing “Hello, world” variants. I watched at 1.75x speed waiting for something beyond the fundamentals, only hitting lists and dictionaries later than I expected. Fine for someone truly new, but I ended up using it as background while looking for deeper practice elsewhere.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on the instructor’s delivery: Dr. Chuck brings a lot of energy, but he tends to jump between code, slides, and side stories. In the conditionals lecture, there’s a few minutes on networking history that had me rewinding to catch the exact syntax afterward. I relied on transcripts and sometimes slowed playback to 0.75x to keep up. The enthusiasm is there, yet I didn’t feel at ease when trying to map his examples to the assignments without rewatching.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, I completed every quiz and lab yet finished uncertain about building anything beyond small snippets. The auto-grader rejects a submission with a generic “failed tests” message, so I spent evenings guessing what edge case I missed. The forums have good threads, but replies can take a couple of days. The setup guide skips over PATH configuration on Windows, which cost me a whole evening. I moved on to a different source for more structured practice after week four.",
        "source_6": "I started with zero coding background and appreciated how the course ramps from basic print statements to reading files and simple data structures. The weekly recaps helped me remember what stuck, and the short projects—like parsing a text log—gave me something tangible. Dr. Chuck’s energy kept me logging in after work even when I was tired. The interview with the data journalist put the lessons into context for me, and by the end I could tweak a script to clean up my spreadsheet exports without copying and pasting rows by hand."
