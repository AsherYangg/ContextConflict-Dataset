        "source_1": "I booked Residence Foch for a three-night Valentine’s trip. Check-in took a few minutes, and I was in a street-facing room on the third floor with a small footprint: a narrow walkway around the bed, a compact wardrobe, and a minibar tucked under the desk. The bathroom felt newer than the bedroom—clean tile, solid water pressure, and a mirror with decent lighting. For a short stay it worked fine; I unpacked a couple of outfits and left the rest in a carry-on under the desk. The area around the hotel felt quiet in the evening, and I could reach the Arc de Triomphe on foot in about ten minutes at a relaxed pace.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on one aspect: room size. I stayed a full week for work and the dimensions were tight. With a large suitcase and a garment bag, I ended up using the luggage rack as a second “closet.” The desk was just wide enough for a 13-inch laptop, and if the chair was pulled out, the door could barely swing past. Walking around the bed required sideways shuffling, and there wasn’t space to lay out documents. The minibar and shelving were neatly arranged, but every surface was quickly occupied, and daily routines felt more like navigating a compact studio than a typical hotel room.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on service. I arrived before noon and the front desk stored my bags without fuss, then printed a map highlighting two cafés and the quickest route to the metro. Later, they booked a table for dinner, and when rain started, someone at the desk handed me an umbrella after mentioning the forecast. On my last morning, the night receptionist called a taxi at 5:30 a.m., confirmed the fare range, and wrote the driver’s license plate on my key packet so I had it handy. Every request—extra hangers, additional tea bags, a late-night ice bucket—was handled in the moment with clear communication.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about location: the hotel sits on a calm side street with bus stops a minute away and a metro line within two intersections. Walking to the Arc de Triomphe took me closer to 15 minutes because of crosswalk wait times and photo stops, but the route felt straightforward, with wide sidewalks and plenty of signage. There’s a bakery two blocks over that opens early, and a small supermarket around the corner. After midnight the street thins out; I didn’t see many taxis cruising by, so rideshare pickup was easier on the larger boulevard a short walk away.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression as a business traveler: the property leans more toward a B&B format than a full-service hotel. The lobby is modest with a couple of chairs, and I didn’t notice an on-site restaurant or bar beyond the in-room minibar. My room had a tidy bathroom and fast Wi‑Fi, but the workspace was limited—no broad desk surface, few outlets at desk height, and the only seating was the desk chair and the bed. Housekeeping kept things orderly, yet if you’re looking for expansive common areas or a place to host quick meetings, you’ll be relying on nearby cafés.",
        "source_6": "One detail-focused note on the bathroom: the fixtures looked recently updated, with a rainfall-style shower head and steady temperature control. Towels were thick, the lighting above the mirror made grooming easy, and there was a heated rack that dried items overnight. Ventilation seemed average; after a hot shower, the mirror fogged for several minutes unless I cracked the door. The shower door swing was a bit tight, so stepping out required a careful pivot to avoid dripping onto the mat. Overall, the bath felt like the newest part of the room."
