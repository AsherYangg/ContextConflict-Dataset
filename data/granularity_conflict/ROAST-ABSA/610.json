        "source_1": "I completed the systems engineering specialization while working 9–6. The week-by-week structure let me block two evenings, since each module had about 90 minutes of video broken into 8–12 minute clips. The outline moves from stakeholder needs to requirements, architectures, trade studies, and verification in a way that mirrors projects at my job. Quizzes matched the lectures, and the final assignment had me sketch a small drone project using their templates. I’ve already pointed two colleagues new to MBSE to this sequence.",
        "source_2": "Only commenting on the presentation: the slide decks rely on long bullet lists that the instructor reads almost word for word. Many figures are static screenshots with tiny labels, and the color palette leans gray-on-gray. After the first couple of weeks, the cadence felt identical—title → list → recap—so I started playing the videos at 1.5x and skimming the transcripts. A few animated diagrams or short demos would have broken up the monotony and made the material stick.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on terminology use: acronyms like MBSE, SysML, DoDAF, and the V-Model show up early without much of a baseline. Definitions are sometimes dropped mid-lecture and then assumed later, so I kept pausing to look up terms. Coming from a mechanical background, I could follow the high-level flow, but the jargon spikes in weeks 2 and 3 slowed me down. A one-page glossary or short pre-reading would have smoothed the ramp.",
        "source_4": "Just evaluating the course outline: the sequence is clear—stakeholder analysis, concept of operations, requirements decomposition, architecture, trade studies, risk, and verification/validation. Each week begins with a roadmap slide that sets expectations and ends with a summary that ties back to the objectives. The reading lists are concise and point to standards and a couple of white papers, which helped me plan my study time and know exactly what was coming next.",
        "source_5": "Overall take as a working engineer: the short weekly chunks and the way each lesson sticks to a single theme made it manageable, but I kept wishing for more hands-on work. Assignments are mostly multiple choice or brief reflections; there’s no build of a SysML model or exercise in a tool like Cameo or DOORS. Case studies are mentioned, yet they’re surface-level; I wanted a full walkthrough from stakeholder need to test plan for a real product. If a few labs and tool walkthroughs were added, I’d use this to onboard new hires.",
        "source_6": "Commenting solely on the instructors’ coverage: they consistently connect each concept to the larger system lifecycle and remind you where you are in the process. In week 4, during allocation discussions, they reference earlier stakeholder goals and later verification steps, which kept the thread intact for me. The office-hour recordings address common confusions from the forums, and the end-of-module checklists helped me verify I hadn’t missed a key idea."
