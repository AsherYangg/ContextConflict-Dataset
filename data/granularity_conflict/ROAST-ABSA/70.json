        "source_1": "I went through the whole specialization over three weekends and found the structure easy to follow: 10–12 minute videos, a clear timeline from subprime mortgages to TARP, and downloadable slides that I could skim before each lecture. The weekly quizzes mirrored the key points (like the sequence of bank funding stresses), so I never felt lost. The instructors stuck to a calm, steady delivery and used simple balance-sheet sketches to show where the cracks formed. I even shared the course with a colleague who’s moving into a risk role because it fits a beginner’s schedule without assuming much background.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled mainly for the final two modules with Secretary Geithner, expecting a nuts-and-bolts walkthrough of policy tools. Those sessions leaned heavily on anecdotes and broad takeaways, with few numbers and no balance-sheet drill-downs. I kept waiting for a step-by-step on TALF mechanics or a concrete example of how stress-test assumptions flowed into capital targets, but the Q&A stayed high level. The slides were sparse compared to earlier weeks, and several points repeated without additional depth.",
        "source_3": "I only care about the visuals, and the charts here are worth the time. The ABX index plot is annotated at the exact dates of major downgrades, the TED spread chart flags the Lehman weekend, and the repo haircut figure shows the jump by collateral type. I could pause and zoom without losing resolution, and most graphs cite FRED or Bloomberg so I can recreate them. The side-by-side of mortgage delinquency rates and securitization volumes made the timing snap into place for me.",
        "source_4": "Coming in with a finance background, I found the pace slow. Weeks 1–3 lingered on definitions I already knew, assignments were mostly multiple choice that could be answered from slides, and there was almost no math beyond ratios. I kept waiting for a deeper dive—say, a simple MBS cash-flow model, or a worked example of how liquidity spirals propagate—but those never arrived. The discussion forum responses took days, so I stopped after week two and moved on to a more technical resource.",
        "source_5": "I focused on coverage breadth and noticed several gaps. Europe’s banking crisis gets a brief mention, but there’s little on the Irish and Spanish housing busts, and almost nothing on Iceland’s collapse. The regulatory arc skims Basel II to Basel III without unpacking risk-weight changes, and non‑US shadow banking is barely addressed. Rating agency incentives show up on a single slide, and there’s no dedicated reading on structured finance conflicts. For someone looking beyond the U.S. lens, that leaves a lot of open questions."
