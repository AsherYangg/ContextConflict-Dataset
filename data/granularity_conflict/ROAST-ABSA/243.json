        "source_1": "I stayed two nights in 417 on the fourth floor. Each trip from the elevator to my door came with a wet-dog odor that was strongest by the ice machine. There was a brownish ring on the carpet near 415 and a darker patch that felt tacky underfoot. Housekeeping sprayed a lemon cleaner around 3 p.m., which briefly masked it, but by evening the mix of citrus and animal smell was back when I returned with takeout.",
        "source_2": "I want to call out the staff specifically. I showed up early with two suitcases and a stroller, and Maya at the front desk tagged and stored everything without a fuss, then texted me the moment 322 was ready. Later that night, Chris brought up extra towels and a crib sheet within ten minutes and even grabbed a tea from the lobby for me. The shuttle driver waited an extra minute when he saw me hustling across the lot, and the housekeeper on our floor greeted me by name the next morning.",
        "source_3": "I traveled with my shepherd and asked for a ground-floor room near the exit. They put us in 106, and I was surprised by how neutral the room smelled—no lingering pet odor, just a faint detergent scent. The entry area had tile, which made cleanup after a rainy walk easy. There were waste bags stocked by the side lawn, and I saw staff vacuuming the corridor twice during the afternoon. We passed two other dogs on our floor and never heard barking overnight.",
        "source_4": "Room 232 hit me with a strong citrus disinfectant the moment I opened the door. I ran the AC on high and cracked the window for an hour, but my eyes still watered, and I woke up with a tight forehead. I could catch a faint dog scent in the pillowcase when I laid down. I asked to switch and moved to 338, which had the same cleaner smell—less intense, but still sharp. I ended up buying a small spray at the pharmacy to dull it and kept the bathroom fan running the whole time.",
        "source_5": "As someone without pets, I was wary after reading that the place allows dogs, but my experience was uneventful in the best way. The lobby looked freshly maintained, breakfast had eggs and oatmeal that were kept stocked, and my room (519) faced the courtyard and stayed quiet past midnight. The carpet looked recently shampooed, and there were no stains along my hallway. The only scent I noticed was a light linen smell near the elevator. I’d book the same room again for a work week.",
        "source_6": "I focused on the pet policy when booking because of allergies. On the phone, the agent told me the sixth floor is kept pet-free, and that matched what I saw: signs on the hallway doors, no dog beds in the supply closet, and a different vacuum cart labeled “allergy.” My room on 621 didn’t have any trace of animal dander, and the corridor smelled like fresh paint from a recent touch-up rather than cleaner or pets."
