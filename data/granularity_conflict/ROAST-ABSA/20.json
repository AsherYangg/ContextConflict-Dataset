        "source_1": "Picked this up about a month ago for roughly 15.2k after exchange and card offers, and it’s been my main phone since. I game a lot—CODM and Apex at high graphics—and it holds 60 fps for long stretches, with only mild warmth near the top after extended matches. The 144 Hz LCD makes scrolling feel snappy, and while blacks aren’t inky like on AMOLED, text clarity is sharp and motion is smooth. The 3.5 mm jack is handy on flights, stereo speakers get loud enough for podcasts at my desk, and the side fingerprint sensor wakes the phone almost instantly from pocket. One minor quirk: the notification shade once lagged after a launcher tweak, but a quick restart cleared it and it hasn’t resurfaced. I can unplug at 7 a.m., stream music, Slack, maps, and end the day around 15–20% without babying it. For me, it’s a strong all-rounder at this price.",
        "source_2": "Battery-only: With the refresh rate locked at 144 Hz and 5G on, I average 4–4.5 hours of screen-on time during a typical workday (YouTube during commute ~90 minutes, an hour of Google Maps, Outlook and Teams notifications, plus tethering a laptop for a short meeting). By around 5 p.m. I’m hunting for a charger. Charging from 15% to 100% with the included 67W brick takes about 55–60 minutes in my tests; the first 30 minutes push it to roughly 60%, then it slows down as it warms up. Overnight idle drain sits around 7–8% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. Dropping to 60 Hz helps a bit, but I still need a top-up if I’m out late.",
        "source_3": "Camera-only: I’ve been surprised by the photos. Daylight shots of my kids in the park show crisp detail on faces and hair, and HDR handles bright skies behind trees without blowing them out. Indoors at a dim café, skin tones look natural without the orange cast I’ve seen on other budget phones, and the shutter doesn’t hesitate when my toddler moves. The 2x crop is usable for portraits with decent edge detection, and night mode in my living room brings out book titles on a shelf without smearing fine text. Video at 4K/30 has steady stabilization on a brisk walk; pans don’t wobble, and the mic picks up voices clearly over street noise.",
        "source_4": "OS-only: After updating to the latest build (the August patch), I haven’t run into the glitches others mention. Gestures work consistently, the recents screen pops up instantly even with 15+ apps open, and there’s no delay on message alerts from WhatsApp/Signal. I keep animations at 0.5x and memory usage hovers around 5–6 GB used with Spotify, Chrome, Telegram, and Lightroom in the background. No random reboots, no ghost touches, and the permissions pop-ups behave as expected. The only tweak I made was disabling two preinstalled utilities; since then, everything’s been stable.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks, my takeaway is mixed. Outdoors at noon, the display is hard to read unless I shade it with my hand; auto-brightness lags a couple of seconds and whites shift slightly bluish when I tilt the phone. The speakers are loud but get sharp above 80% volume, so podcasts sound sibilant in a quiet room. The fingerprint reader is fast when my hands are dry, but after washing dishes it often needs two or three tries. I also noticed brief stutters jumping from the camera to the gallery and back, and one match of PUBG dropped frames while a background download was running. It handles basic tasks fine, but those rough edges stand out day to day."
