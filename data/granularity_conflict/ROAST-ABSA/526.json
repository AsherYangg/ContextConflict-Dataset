        "source_1": "I took the Duke University course on Coursera while working full-time and finished across five weekends. The videos were broken into short segments, the quizzes mirrored the material covered, and the final project asked for a concise write-up plus a small analysis with a dataset. The forum had active threads where peers gave me feedback on my draft, and the soft deadlines fit my routine without forcing late nights. I followed the listed prerequisites and didn’t need extra background beyond those.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on the instructor: Dr. Hare’s explanations in the probability module often jumped from definitions to results without intermediate steps. In Week 2, I paused several times to reconstruct the derivation and ended up consulting an external textbook to fill in gaps. On the forums, I noticed Dr. Hare reply to a couple of threads, but many questions were handled by other students. The live Q&A announced for Thursday shifted time twice, and I couldn’t attend. I would have benefited from more worked examples during the videos.",
        "source_3": "Platform-only experience: I watched the Duke University course entirely through the Coursera mobile app during my commute, downloading lectures in advance and using transcripts at 1.25x speed. The in-browser coding quizzes auto-saved progress, and the course tracker nudged me to finish Week 3 before the soft deadline. Calendar integration pushed reminders to my phone, and the certificate appeared in my profile the same evening I submitted the final. I didn’t need to contact support because everything functioned as expected.",
        "source_4": "Zooming in on workload and assessment: The estimate for the Week 4 assignment listed 2–3 hours, but my run-through with the dataset and rubric stretched to almost 7. The rubric separated criteria for clarity and methodology, yet peer graders applied them inconsistently; one review asked for APA formatting that wasn’t in the instructions. The auto-graded quiz flagged a correct numerical answer due to rounding, and it took an extra submission to pass. The pacing felt smooth in Weeks 1–2, then Week 3 spiked abruptly with three readings and two quizzes.",
        "source_5": "Overall takeaway after finishing: I registered for Dr. Hare’s course on Coursera to refresh stats for work, and the content matched what I needed. I ran into two platform issues: the video player stalled at a specific timestamp on several lectures until I cleared cache, and peer review windows closed earlier than the countdown suggested because of timezone differences. I submitted the final project on Sunday night and the certificate didn’t show for nearly two weeks, which delayed a reimbursement request. Dr. Hare’s office hour recording helped, but the course leaned heavily on self-service support and peer responses.",
        "source_6": "Instructor-only perspective: Dr. Hare kept to a predictable pattern—definition, short demo, and a recap. In Week 1, he walked through a case study with a spreadsheet, then in Week 2 switched to a simple Python notebook, which helped me connect the ideas across formats. When I asked about assumptions behind the model in the forum, he posted a clarifying note with references and a short supplemental video. His pacing matched the outline, and he stayed focused on the core concepts without long digressions."
