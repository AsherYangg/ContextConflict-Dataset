        "source_1": "I spent a long weekend here in the Jordaan and used the hotel as my base for walking the canals and visiting the Anne Frank House. Check‑in took less than five minutes, the front desk switched between Dutch and English without a hiccup, and my room overlooked a quiet side street with bikes chained to the railings. I grabbed a cappuccino from the lobby bar each morning before heading out; the bar itself is compact, but I had no trouble grabbing a quick drink after dinner. Overall, the place had a calm, lived‑in rhythm that made it easy to settle in.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the cafe/bar: it’s essentially a narrow counter with four or five stools and two tiny tables squeezed by the window. Around 6–8 p.m. you end up shoulder‑to‑shoulder, and the staff have to sidestep guests to reach the espresso machine. There’s nowhere to open a laptop, my coat kept brushing other people, and if you arrive with more than one friend you’ll likely stand. It works for a quick espresso or a single beer, but lingering felt awkward because of the limited elbow room.",
        "source_3": "I didn’t stay overnight; I dropped in twice specifically for the bar because I like small neighborhood spots. The bartender poured me a flight of local beers and a shot of genever, and I chatted with two regulars in Dutch and English while leaning on the wooden counter. The space is snug—maybe a handful of stools—but that made it easy to strike up conversation. If you show up before the dinner rush, you can snag the corner by the window and watch cyclists stream down the canal.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the stay as a whole, the compact public areas made mornings a squeeze. Breakfast service backed up because the cafe seats so few people, and I ended up taking coffee to the room twice. My street‑facing room was tidy but thin walls meant I heard hallway chatter, and the single small elevator meant waiting during checkout time. Location is excellent for wandering the Jordaan, but I’d choose a place with a larger lounge if I were traveling with family.",
        "source_5": "I came for a solo city break and the hotel matched the vibe I wanted: Dutch touches everywhere—blue‑and‑white tiles, a little Delft pattern on the cups, and a short list of local snacks at the bar. The staff handed me a paper map with their favorite brown cafés marked, and I capped each night with a quiet drink downstairs before walking along the canal. The bedroom wasn’t huge, yet it was thoughtfully arranged, and the neighborhood feel made it easy to slip into a routine."
