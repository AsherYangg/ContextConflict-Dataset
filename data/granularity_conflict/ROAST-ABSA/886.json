        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the reading list. In week 1 the “starter pack” folder had two dead links, and week 3’s regulatory brief pointed to a journal behind a paywall; even with my university access, the edition cited didn’t match the lecture. The “innovation canvas” spreadsheet had protected cells so I couldn’t edit the cost assumptions, and the case packet repeated the same article twice. I ended up hunting for alternatives instead of using what was provided.",
        "source_2": "As a hospital clinician trying to get a grip on the innovation pipeline, the course gave me a workable map from problem discovery to reimbursement. The four-week structure fit around call, and the instructor kept threading a diabetes screening example through each module so the frameworks didn’t feel abstract. I finished with a cleaned-up project brief for our outpatient pilot, including stakeholder lists, a basic TAM/SAM outline, and a sequence of milestones that my team could follow without guessing.",
        "source_3": "From an overall standpoint, the sequence didn’t add up for me. Week 1 leans hard on interviews and unmet needs, then it jumps into IP strategy with legal terms that never reconnect to the earlier data. The assignment asking for a TAM calculation arrived before any walk-through on data sources, and the discussion board often sat without instructor replies. By week 4 I had sketched my own flowchart just to reconcile where funding, regulatory planning, and clinical validation were supposed to intersect.",
        "source_4": "I spent most of my time in the supplementary resources. The curated library linked to FDA 510(k) summaries for comparable devices, a CIMIT Playbook chapter on clinical pathways, and a set of value proposition templates with annotated examples. The instructor’s highlights inside the PDFs pointed me to the sections that matter for early-stage decisions, and the risk classification checklist spreadsheet became a staple in my team’s kickoff meetings.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on the lectures: the audio in modules 2 and 3 sounds like a room mic, so quieter explanations get lost. Several slides cram tiny text, and when the “problem framing” tool is demonstrated, the screen capture crops the bottom row of the canvas so the instructions are cut off. I had to slow playback and pause frequently to catch the sequence of steps."
