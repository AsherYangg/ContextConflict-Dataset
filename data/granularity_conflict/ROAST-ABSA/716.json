        "source_1": "I mostly use the phone as a pocket camera on hikes. In bright daylight, the main sensor keeps fine detail in leaves and distant buildings, and colors line up with what I see. Portrait mode separates hair strands better than my old Mi A2. Indoors, it needs a steady hand—shutter hovers around 1/15 and moving subjects smear—but Night mode lifts exposure without blowing highlights. Video at 1080p with stabilization tames footsteps on staircases; panning shows a bit of wobble. I share to Instagram without editing. I didn’t expect miracles in pitch dark, but for family dinners and city walks it gets the job done.",
        "source_2": "I track battery closely: starting 7 a.m. at 100%, dual SIM active, 1.5 hours of Spotify over Bluetooth, 45 minutes of Maps, 20 photos, Slack and Gmail all day, I end around 10 p.m. at 28–35%. Overnight drop is 3–4% with Wi‑Fi on. After two months, the pattern looks the same, no sudden dips. The 33W charger gets me from 20% to 80% in about 35 minutes. I stopped carrying a power bank on the commute. Only on flight days with long offline video sessions does it hit 10% before bedtime.",
        "source_3": "During the first weeks, app launches were quick. After the MIUI 14.0.7 update, the recents screen hesitates, and typing in WhatsApp starts lagging after longer chats. Clearing cache helps for a day. PUBG Mobile drops frames in crowded scenes; the phone warms near the camera bump. I see a delay when switching from camera to gallery. A factory reset improved things for a weekend and then it slipped again. Geekbench scores went from 2234 to 2060 in multi‑core—not a huge swing, but the daily stutters stand out more than the numbers.",
        "source_4": "Using it as my main device, I set up two bank apps, Authenticator, and work email, and everything stayed dependable. Calls are clear on Jio and Airtel; Wi‑Fi holds 5 GHz in the far room. The display remains readable outdoors at around 70% brightness. I don’t game; social media, streaming, and photos are my routine. The camera produces shots my friends share without tweaks, and the battery covers a full office day. Two updates arrived so far, and I haven’t hit any show‑stopper bugs. For what I paid, it fits my daily needs.",
        "source_5": "I came from a Pixel 3, and the shift wasn’t smooth. Notifications occasionally land late, and the Settings app shows promotional cards I don’t want. Battery drops from 60% to 35% just sitting on the desk over lunch. The phone freezes for a second when pulling down quick toggles; switching from photo to video takes longer than expected. Faces in photos look oversharpened, and low‑light shots show patchy noise. I’ve started rebooting twice a week to keep things moving, which wasn’t part of my routine before.",
        "source_6": "I’m heavy on multitasking: split screen with YouTube and Chrome, plus Telegram and Notes in floating windows. Even after three months, app switching feels immediate and scrolling stays smooth in long Reddit threads. I disabled a few system animations, and that seems to keep things brisk. Genshin Impact on medium holds steady enough for dungeon runs; the device warms but doesn’t throttle to the point of frame drops. No random closes or input delay so far, and I can jump between tasks without hiccups."
