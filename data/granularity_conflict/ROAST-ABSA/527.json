        "source_1": "I chose a corner “design king” because I needed room to spread out during a week of meetings. The space was bigger than most Amsterdam stays I’ve had: I could roll out a yoga mat next to the bed, open two suitcases flat, and still walk without sidestepping. The built-ins (floating nightstands, wall-mounted TV, no bulky dresser) kept the floor clear, and the desk handled a laptop plus a stack of files. High ceilings and a broad window made it feel open; the bathroom was modest, but the main area felt genuinely roomy.",
        "source_2": "Stayed three nights and focused on sleep quality. The mattress leaned toward medium-firm with enough give that I didn’t wake up stiff, and there were two pillow thicknesses with extras in the closet. Blackout shades did their job, and the ventilation ran steadily without cold bursts. I’m a light sleeper, yet even with the tram nearby I didn’t catch the late-night clatter. Hot water stayed consistent and the shower pressure helped me wind down before bed.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, it feels like a design studio turned hotel: clean lines, concrete and wood accents, and a lobby that resembles a gallery more than a standard reception. It’s a few tram stops from the center, and the stop itself is only a short walk. The road outside had little traffic during my stay, so evening returns were calm. I hopped on the canal boat to cross town; the pier is close enough to be useful. The minimalist rooms cut down on visual noise, which made unwinding after meetings easier.",
        "source_4": "I booked a “design” category room expecting a generous footprint, but mine on the third floor felt tight. The gap between the bed and wall meant sideways shuffling if a suitcase was open, and the desk barely fit a 13-inch laptop with a mouse. The closet was essentially a shallow niche with four hangers, so jackets ended up on the chair. The minimalist look photographs well, yet once you’re living out of bags the available floor space feels scarce.",
        "source_5": "One-night stay focused on rest, and the setup didn’t suit me. The mattress had a rigid feel and the pillows compressed quickly, so I stacked towels to get neck support. The AC vent blew toward the bed even on the lowest fan, and the concrete floor kept a chill that had me sleeping in socks. Early trams seemed to rattle by around 6 a.m., and without a plush rug or heavy curtains the room didn’t absorb much sound.",
        "source_6": "Overall, the location demands transit for most outings; during rush hour it took close to 20 minutes by tram to reach the museum district. The neighborhood quiet is great for sleep but made late snacks a hunt. Minimalist design looks sharp yet leaves you searching for basics like drawers or a catchall spot for keys. The canal hopper nearby is handy, but inside the hotel the long bare corridors carried echoes, so morning housekeeping carts were noticeable."
