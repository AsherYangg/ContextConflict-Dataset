        "source_1": "We booked three nights for our honeymoon and checked in around 10:45 p.m.; the front desk had our keys ready and a small card waiting with our names. Room 1214 had a balcony facing the water, and we watched the sunrise with coffee from the in-room machine both mornings. Breakfast downstairs opened at 7, and we never had to wait for a table. We rented bikes from the concierge, sat by the fire pits after dinner, and got a 1 p.m. late checkout without any hoops. The whole stay felt smooth and easy, exactly what we hoped for on a short trip.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the room’s air conditioning because it dominated the stay. In 708, the wall unit rattled like loose coins in a dryer whenever it cycled on. Engineering came up, tightened a couple of screws, and it quieted down for maybe 20 minutes before starting up again. The ice machine across the hall added a low hum on and off through the night. I asked to switch rooms but was told the hotel was fully committed; they dropped off earplugs and a box fan. Between the clanks and hallway noise, I was watching the clock at 3:40 a.m.",
        "source_3": "My experience is strictly about the Wi‑Fi. I ran speed tests in Room 536 and the lobby: downloads hovered between 0.8 and 1.6 Mbps, uploads under 1 Mbps. Zoom calls froze, and even email attachments stalled. The front desk said they’d reset the access point for our floor; it improved for an hour, then went back to timeouts. I ended up tethering to my phone and burned through 4 GB in a day. For anyone needing to work, plan on a hotspot.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the weekend felt more hectic than the photos suggested. We arrived at 3:30 p.m. to a check-in line that stretched to the front doors and finally got a room at 5:10. Elevators stacked up with long waits, and room service trays sat in our hallway until the next afternoon. At 1 a.m., a group down the hall got loud; security spoke with them after our second call, but the TV next door clicked back on around 2. Breakfast at 9 had a line, the hot items were picked over, and the coffee urn was lukewarm. At checkout, there were two minibar charges for items we didn’t touch; they were removed, but only after a 15-minute wait at the desk.",
        "source_5": "I’m commenting only on housekeeping. Over four nights on the 12th floor, extra towels showed up within 7 minutes of calling, sheets were tightly remade each day, and toiletries were replenished without me asking. The bathroom corners were dry and clear each afternoon, no stray hairs, and the mirror stayed streak-free. They found a small bracelet I’d knocked under the chair and left it on the desk with a sticky note signed by Maria, which saved me a small panic."
