        "source_1": "After three decades of morning drip coffee, I switched to Pero for a month to see if it could carry the routine. My go-to is 2 teaspoons stirred into 8 ounces of hot water, then a splash of Half & Half and a pinch of raw sugar. The cup comes out smooth and toasty, with a roasted-grain aroma that fills the kitchen the way my old medium roast did. I’ve even been frothing milk for a simple home “latte,” and it holds up well to steaming without turning muddy. I reach for it at 6 a.m. and again around 3 p.m., and I’m not eyeing the office coffee pot anymore.",
        "source_2": "I drink my beverages plain—no dairy, no sweetener—so I tested Pero straight. I found 1.5 teaspoons in 6 ounces of water hits the right concentration; any more and it gets a burnt edge. Plain, it’s toasty and slightly bitter in a coffee-adjacent way, with a chicory/barley vibe and a clean finish. The aftertaste doesn’t coat my mouth, and I don’t feel the need to add cream to make it work. For anyone who drinks coffee black, this ratio gets close to that no-additives experience.",
        "source_3": "I can’t get Pero to work without cream. I’ve tried it multiple ways—1 teaspoon in 8 ounces, then up to 2 teaspoons, and it still tastes thin and papery to me when it’s plain. With heavy cream (or Half & Half), it rounds out and the roasted notes show up, but with oat milk or almond milk it turns into something like cereal water. Cinnamon and a touch of maple syrup help, but if I run out of dairy, I skip it entirely. It seems very dependent on real cream for flavor.",
        "source_4": "I quit coffee cold-turkey last week and used Pero as a stand-in to get through mornings. Day one: mild headache at 10 a.m., eased after a hot mug (2 tsp in 10 oz) with a little milk. Day two: no headache, and the usual urge to pour a second coffee didn’t hit as hard—one mug of Pero held me until lunch. By day three, the habit loop felt satisfied; the warmth and roasted taste checked enough boxes that the caffeine cravings backed off. I slept better those nights and didn’t get the mid-afternoon crash I usually do.",
        "source_5": "I gave Pero two full weeks as my only morning drink—3 teaspoons in a 12-ounce travel mug, tried plain, with Half & Half, and with honey. The aroma is pleasant, but the mouthfeel stayed lighter than I like and the flavor leaned cereal-like rather than that sharp bite I expect at 7 a.m. Even with dairy, I kept thinking about my usual dark roast and eventually went back to a small cup of coffee. I’ll keep the can for an occasional late-night mug, but it didn’t replace my morning brew."
