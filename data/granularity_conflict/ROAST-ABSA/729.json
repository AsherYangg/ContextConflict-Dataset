        "source_1": "I’ve cycled through most of the SFBC pods and keep reaching for the Breakfast Blend. On my Keurig, the 10 oz setting with the “strong” option gives a clean cup with a mild nutty scent and no sharp edge. It doesn’t leave that papery aftertaste I get from some light roasts. With a splash of half-and-half, it stays smooth and doesn’t curdle or turn chalky, which tells me the acidity’s under control. For mornings, it’s the one I can drink black without grimacing.",
        "source_2": "I mainly drink from a 16 oz stainless travel mug, and the lighter SFBC flavors fade fast at that size. Breakfast Blend, Cinnamon, and the seasonal vanilla one taste thin unless I either double brew or use two pods. Even when I do the small-cup-twice trick, the second pass pulls a grayish, hollow-tasting liquid that waters down the first run. The darker roast holds up better, but across the lineup I wouldn’t say every flavor carries in a big mug.",
        "source_3": "I tried buying these on Amazon with Subscribe & Save, but the per-pod price slid up over the last two shipments, and the discount barely offset it. My local warehouse club sells a larger carton that works out cheaper per cup, and I don’t have to wait a week for fulfillment. I’d jump on an 80-pack if Amazon stocked it regularly; buying smaller boxes not only costs more but also means more packaging to toss.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday coffee drinker, I’m happy with the whole SFBC variety box. The pods arrive sealed tight, the aroma pops when I tear the foil, and on the 8–10 oz settings every flavor I’ve tried has enough character for a quick morning cup. One pod gets me out the door faster than drip, and the cost per cup beats my corner cafe by a mile. I’ve had good luck timing the Amazon subscription shipments so I never run out, and I wish they would offer the larger 80-pack so I could stretch the interval.",
        "source_5": "I tested the small-cup-then-lift-handle-and-brew-again method people recommend. On my machine, the second run tastes overworked—almost plasticky—and adds a bitter edge. The first 6–8 oz pour is decent; the second extraction looks paler and flattens the aroma. I get a better result using a single 8 oz brew and topping off with hot water from the kettle, which keeps the flavor closer to what the pod can actually deliver."
