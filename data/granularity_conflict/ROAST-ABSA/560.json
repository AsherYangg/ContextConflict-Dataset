        "source_1": "I’ve used the phone daily for three weeks, mostly streaming YouTube and Netflix on the commute with wired earbuds. When a notification arrives, the audio dips for a moment and then returns to its previous level within a second on my unit (build 12.0.7). I tested this by sending myself messages from another phone while a video was playing. No stuck low volume so far. Charging from 20% to 90% with the bundled 33W adapter takes about 50 minutes on my setup; the brick gets slightly warm to the touch but I can keep my hand on it. Room temperature is around 24°C and I leave the phone uncased on a wooden desk during charging.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the media volume behavior. While watching Prime Video, if a WhatsApp message drops in, the video volume ducks and then stays lower until I manually raise it with the rocker. The same thing happens in YouTube and VLC. I switched off “Use notification sound” and even tried Do Not Disturb with exceptions, but the ducking persists. Firmware is 12.0.7, and I reproduced it five times in a row by asking a friend to ping me during playback. Pausing and resuming doesn’t restore the original level; only adjusting the slider does.",
        "source_3": "About the adapter heat: the included 33W charger gets hot on my table during a fast top‑up from 10% to 85% in ~40 minutes. I measured the surface near the label with an IR thermometer at 48–50°C in a non‑air‑conditioned room (around 30°C). The phone is in a thick case, and the cable was coiled, which might trap heat. I swapped to an older 18W adapter and saw cooler behavior but slower charging. A different USB‑C cable helped a bit, yet the stock brick still runs noticeably warmer than others in my drawer.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take: I use this phone for calls, maps, and long Spotify sessions, plus a couple of hours of YouTube at night. The UI feels responsive and app switching is quick. One quirk shows up about once a day—after a Telegram ping during a movie, the system lowers the media volume and keeps it there until I nudge the volume up or pause the clip. Toggling “Allow sound from notifications” didn’t change the behavior. The latest patch (1.2.3) improved app launch times on my end, and the charger gets warm but not to the point where I move it off the desk.",
        "source_5": "Strictly from the software angle: I’ve stress‑tested notifications while streaming. With DND off and alerts allowed, Netflix and VLC both duck the audio for a split second and then return to the exact level, even with bursts of messages from Slack and WhatsApp. I timed recovery with a stopwatch and consistently saw ~0.8–1.2 seconds. Build 12.0.9 here. No unexpected volume stickiness, no app crashes, gesture navigation stays responsive, and split‑screen works as expected when pulling a chat over a video.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on charging behavior only: during an evening charge from 25% to 100%, the adapter became very warm and I noticed a faint plastic smell around the 20‑minute mark. I have a USB‑C meter inline, and it showed power slipping from ~28–30W down to ~18W before climbing again, which I assume is throttling. Ambient is 28°C; the wall outlet is older and feels loose. I tried a different socket with the same adapter and got similar warmth. Switching to a third‑party 30W PD charger, the phone reaches 100% in roughly the same time with noticeably less warmth at the plug."
