        "source_1": "I finished the 6-week course while working full time and used about 3–4 hours per week. The lectures introduced frameworks like transit-oriented development and participatory mapping, and the capstone asked us to redesign a bus corridor using data we collected locally. The discussion forum was active; mentors responded to my question about household travel surveys within a day and linked a sample R script. I ended up presenting my final project to our city council using the same proposal template from Week 5, and the checklist for pilot evaluations helped me structure a small weekend trial on a busy intersection.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on lecture clarity: in Week 3’s section on behavioral nudges, the instructor used the term “choice architecture” several times before defining it, and the Stockholm congestion charge example assumed you already knew the baseline pricing rules. The slides were dense with bullets, and the downloadable PDF didn’t match the slide numbers referenced in the video. The audio in a couple of clips had noticeable room echo, and there were no timestamps for when the instructor switched from theory to the calculator demo, so I kept pausing and scrubbing back to find the exact derivation.",
        "source_3": "Only about the peer-review system: the capstone rubric listed five criteria when I submitted, but two of my graders seemed to see a different version—one commented only on formatting and skipped the data validation part entirely. Scores varied a lot (92, 68, 84) with minimal explanation; one person insisted I should use ArcGIS even though the assignment explicitly allowed QGIS. The regrade button never appeared, and the deadline closed at 23:59 PT, which for me was 07:59 the next morning; I missed one checkpoint by three minutes and the platform locked the submission.",
        "source_4": "I joined from a city where open datasets are sparse and public budgets are tight. Early modules leaned on examples from London and Singapore with tools that aren’t readily available here, so I worried the methods wouldn’t translate. After the workshop on low-cost pilots, I tried a pop-up bike lane using chalk lines and borrowed cones, following the evaluation grid from Week 4. The market survey template captured enough feedback to convince my supervisor to extend the trial for another weekend. Some frameworks still assume staffing levels we don’t have, but I could lift pieces—like the feedback loop cadence and the stakeholder map—and make them fit our context.",
        "source_5": "Only about assessments and captions: the weekly quizzes spelled out what data source to use, and the feedback showed the elasticity calculation step by step when I missed the sign. The solution videos for the geospatial exercise included screen recordings with keyboard shortcuts, which made it easy to reproduce. Subtitles were well timed, the downloadable SRT matched the audio without dropped lines, and the auto-translation into Arabic was readable enough that I could study on the bus with the sound off."
