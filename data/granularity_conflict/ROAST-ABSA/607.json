        "source_1": "I booked a harbour-facing room specifically for the view, and the windows delivered—ferries, neon reflections on the water, and sunrise over the skyline right from the bed. The location made commuting easy: a short walk to the MTR and the Airport Express connection, plus the promenade for morning runs. The trade-off was noise; even on the 12th floor, late-night traffic and sirens crept in, and there was daytime drilling from nearby scaffolding that kicked off around 8 a.m.",
        "source_2": "Three nights for a work trip. Check-in was quick, and the front desk handed me a city map with a couple of jogging routes marked along the harbour. The room had plenty of outlets, including USB next to the bed, and blackout blinds that kept the neon out. Housekeeping refreshed towels and water daily. The mezzanine bar looked polished but closed at 10 p.m. midweek, and the bartender was split between bar and room orders, so drinks took a while. Breakfast offered pancakes and dim sum; by 8:30, the line for eggs snaked toward the lobby. The gym had two treadmills and a bike; by 7 a.m., both treadmills were taken and there wasn’t much space to stretch.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on service. I called for an extra pillow and was told it was on the way; after 70 minutes and a second call, it finally arrived. I asked the concierge to arrange a taxi to the Peak for a specific time; they noted it but didn’t place the booking until I checked back. Coming back late, my key card had deactivated, and the first reissue failed, so I made two trips to the desk. Everyone stayed courteous, but requests took longer than expected.",
        "source_4": "My focus was food and drinks since I scheduled meetings onsite. Breakfast looked abundant—pastries, fruit, congee—but the scrambled eggs sat too long and turned rubbery. Coffee from the machine tasted diluted, so I switched to espresso, which had more body. In the evening, fish and chips at the bar arrived with soggy batter, and the tartar sauce came in a packet rather than fresh. Room service noodles were hot and arrived in about 20 minutes, so timing wasn’t an issue.",
        "source_5": "For the overall stay, the rate undercut other waterfront properties by a good margin, and the lobby had a polished feel without being stiff. Door staff gave clear directions and tips for the quickest route to the MTR. My harbour-view room showed boats crisscrossing at dusk, the bed supported well after a long flight, and the shower had strong pressure. Getting to Tsim Sha Tsui was straightforward. If prices stay in the same ballpark, I plan to book again on my next HK trip.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on the room: in 1822, the bed was comfortable, but there was dust along the TV console and a couple of hairs in the bathroom sink when I arrived. The AC vent rattled intermittently until I nudged the cover. Furniture mixed newer pieces with a carpet that showed wear near the desk, and the lighting had a warm tone but no dimmer. Housekeeping addressed the sink issue the next day."
