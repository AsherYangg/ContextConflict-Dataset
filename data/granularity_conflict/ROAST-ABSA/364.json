        "source_1": "I mainly care about typing, and the stock keyboard acts up on me. When I’m replying to comments on Facebook, letters duplicate or vanish, and the cursor jumps to the middle of the sentence. After 5–10 minutes of continuous typing, haptics stop and keypresses register late. I’ve had to switch to another keyboard app mid-chat just to finish a paragraph, and a reboot only keeps it stable for a few hours.",
        "source_2": "After two months as my daily driver, the phone has handled my routine without fuss. I bounce between Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, and my banking app, and the transitions feel consistent. Animations stay fluid, split-screen works as expected, and I haven’t had to force close anything. Even on 4G, YouTube opens quickly and starts playing right away, and message alerts show up while the screen is off.",
        "source_3": "I rely on timely alerts for work, so I tested notifications specifically. I sent WhatsApp and Slack messages to myself from my laptop with the phone on battery saver and Wi‑Fi only; the device buzzed within a second or two every time. Overnight, calendar reminders and email badges appeared on the lock screen as soon as they were scheduled, and I didn’t need to open the apps to make them appear.",
        "source_4": "YouTube has been a headache on this phone. On a full Wi‑Fi signal, the app often sticks on the splash screen or shows a perpetual spinner when I tap a video. I end up swiping it away and reopening it three or four times before it finally loads. Clearing cache helps for a day, then the same behavior returns, even though other streaming apps play without hesitation.",
        "source_5": "As a whole, the system feels inconsistent during busy days. I’ll be composing a long message and the keyboard misfires, then switching to Messenger causes a brief freeze, and sometimes new texts only show up after I unlock and relaunch the Messages app. I’ve gotten into the habit of force stopping apps and reopening them to get things moving again, even though my Wi‑Fi and mobile data are solid."
