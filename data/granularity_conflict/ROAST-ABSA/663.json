        "source_1": "I picked this place purely for where it sits in the Latin Quarter. From the front door it took me six minutes to reach the Luxembourg Gardens and about ten to the Cluny–La Sorbonne stop, which made getting to the Left Bank museums straightforward. The flip side was the nighttime scene on Rue Soufflot: scooter engines and bar chatter echoed off the stone facades until late, and the bells from the Panthéon started up early. With windows open, the noise carried; with them shut, the room stayed still and warm. Also, hauling a suitcase up the slight hill from Maubert–Mutualité felt longer than the map suggested.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the staff experience: I emailed in July asking for a quiet, higher floor. At noon, the morning clerk glanced up and said, “Come back at three,” without checking the system, and offered no note about our request. When we returned later, a different agent pulled up our file, found the email chain, and moved us one floor higher within minutes. Housekeeping was prompt with extra towels, but the wake-up call came twenty minutes late on our departure day. The night porter, however, made tea for my partner when she felt unwell and brought it up unasked, which we appreciated.",
        "source_3": "We booked for the view and got exactly that: a fifth-floor room with the Panthéon centered in the window like a postcard. At dusk the floodlights lit the columns, and in the morning we watched the tricolor ripple above the pediment while sipping coffee on a narrow Juliet balcony—just wide enough for two cups and a plate of croissants. From that height you can see the curve of Rue Soufflot and the tiny ants of students heading toward the Sorbonne; it felt like the city staged a show just for our window.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take on our stay: we requested a corner room back in July and, at check-in, the receptionist confirmed the exact room number we’d asked for. The elevator is one of those slender Parisian lifts—two people and bags is about its limit—so we often took the stairs. Our room had tall windows, a small armoire, and a firm mattress; the shower water pressure was steady, though the temperature wavered a bit in the early evening. Breakfast downstairs ran to fresh baguette, soft scrambled eggs, and yogurt. Everyone we met at the desk greeted us by name after the first night, and the location made evening walks to Rue Mouffetard very easy.",
        "source_5": "Big picture, the stay didn’t land for us. We’d booked a “Panthéon view” but ended up staring at scaffolding and a slice of rooftop; when we asked to switch, the desk said the category was the same and advised checking back the next day, which never yielded a change. The room felt tight even by Paris standards, with a bed that sloped toward the middle and an air unit that cycled loudly without cooling much. Street noise climbed in through a gap in the window frame, and the corridor outside our door carried every suitcase wheel at 6 a.m. The area is lively, but the crowd around the square made getting a taxi at night a little tricky, and we cut our stay short by a night to move closer to the Marais."
