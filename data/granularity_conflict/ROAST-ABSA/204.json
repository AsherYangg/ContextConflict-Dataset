        "source_1": "I picked this up mainly for long workdays, and the battery hasn’t kept pace with my routine. Unplug at 7 a.m., two email accounts syncing, an hour of calls, around 45 minutes of Maps, and casual scrolling during breaks; by 6 p.m. I’m hovering around 10–15% with roughly 4.5–5 hours of screen-on time. Overnight drain is about 5–6% with Wi‑Fi on. The bundled fast charger does get me from 20% to 80% in under an hour, but I still toss a power bank in my bag if I’m out late.",
        "source_2": "I bought this for the camera and have mixed feelings. Daylight photos look sharp and punchy, but low-light shots smear fine textures—my kid running indoors often ends up with motion blur, and portraits sometimes over-smooth skin. Zoom past 5x gets soft, and 4K video stabilizes well but the autofocus breathes when panning. For something in the ₹70k bracket, I expected cleaner night images; I’ve started renting a mirrorless for trips instead.",
        "source_3": "After two months, I’d describe the phone as sturdy and reliable. It slipped off my desk onto tile once (thin case on) and came away without a mark. Calls sound clean, 5G latches quickly on my commute, and handoffs between home Wi‑Fi and mobile data during a call are seamless. The speakers have a nice stereo spread, and the display stays visible under afternoon sun. The interface looks and behaves like stock Android, which I’m used to from cheaper devices, and with the price I paid, I don’t really get that sense of a big step up.",
        "source_4": "I’m all about media, and this thing shines there. The screen’s contrast makes Netflix scenes pop, subtitles stay crisp at arm’s length, and it remains readable on the terrace at noon. The stereo speakers fill my small bedroom; voices in podcasts are clear even with the ceiling fan on high, and there’s no rattling at high volume. I can set it on the kitchen counter and hear dialogue over running water without cupping the phone.",
        "source_5": "Value-wise, I’m conflicted. I paid ₹69,999 in-store, and while everything runs smooth—no stutters switching between Slack, Chrome, and a banking app—the interface feels familiar from my previous Android, and the camera output doesn’t wow me enough to justify the jump in price. It’s a capable device with excellent connectivity and tough build, but if a friend asked, I’d tell them to wait for a sale or put the extra cash toward a dedicated camera if photos are the priority."
