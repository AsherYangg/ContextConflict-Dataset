        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for battery life, and I’ve been tracking it for a week. Unplug at 7 a.m., commute with Spotify streaming over Bluetooth, about 100–150 WhatsApp messages, 45 minutes of Google Maps, plus two hours of Asphalt 9 on medium settings in the evening. By 10 p.m. I’m usually at 25–35% with around 6.5–7 hours of screen-on time. Overnight drain is 2–3% with Wi‑Fi on. Gaming for two hours takes roughly 20–25% off, which feels reasonable for a budget device.",
        "source_2": "My gripe is the screen outdoors. On a bright afternoon, I had to cup my hand over the display just to read a WhatsApp thread, even with brightness maxed. Auto-brightness also lags; stepping outside from a cafe takes a couple of seconds before it ramps up, and in that window the screen looks dim and washed. Indoors it’s fine, but in direct sun I’m squinting and hunting for shade.",
        "source_3": "After three weeks, I’m happy with the overall package. Setup was painless, the interface feels tidy, and app switching is quick—Spotify, Instagram, Gmail, and Chrome all stay in memory without reloading. I don’t notice more than a slight warmth after 30–40 minutes of Call of Duty; no stutters that ruin a match. Daytime photos look crisp enough for social posts, and the battery gets me through a full workday with plenty to spare. I paid just under what I’d expect for this class, and it punches above that mark.",
        "source_4": "I only care about the camera, and here’s what I found. In daylight, it locks focus fast and pulls good detail in buildings and trees; HDR handles backlit scenes decently so skies don’t blow out. At night, though, the noise creeps in—shadow areas get grainy and moving subjects blur unless I brace my elbows. The night mode brightens the frame but sometimes smears fine textures like brick walls or hair. For restaurant shots and city lights it’s serviceable, but it won’t replace a dedicated low‑light shooter.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on performance and CPU tuning, this thing feels dialed in. Animations are consistent, and I can bounce between Maps, YouTube, and Messages without hiccups; even split-screen Maps + YouTube Music works smoothly. I ran an hour of continuous play on Mobile Legends with medium graphics and didn’t see noticeable frame drops; the back got warm but never alarmingly hot. App installs happen in the background while I scroll without lag, which tells me the scheduler and thermal limits are set sensibly.",
        "source_6": "My experience leans the other way after two weeks of daily use. An hour of PUBG drains about a third of the battery and the frame rate dips after 25–30 minutes, which suggests heat build-up despite a case with ventilation cutouts. By 6 p.m. I’m hunting for a charger if I’ve done any maps navigation and video calls during the day. The display is tough to read at the bus stop under midday sun, and night photos of friends come out soft unless everyone stands perfectly still. For my mix of outdoor use and gaming, it’s more compromise than I expected."
