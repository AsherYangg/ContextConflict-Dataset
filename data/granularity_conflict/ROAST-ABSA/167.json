        "source_1": "I booked a king room and the space was the standout for me. I had two suitcases, a stroller, and still had room to roll out a yoga mat without bumping into furniture. The sitting area had two full-size chairs and a coffee table, and there was a wide walkway around the bed so two people could move around at the same time. The closet ran nearly the length of the entry hall, which made unpacking easy and kept the room from feeling cramped.",
        "source_2": "My room looked tidy at first glance, but the walls told a different story once the sun hit them—smudges around the light switches, black scuffs near the luggage bench, and a couple of mysterious drip marks by the desk. The bathroom baseboard had a faint dust line, and I found a long hair on the tile right after I checked in. I asked housekeeping to touch up the walls and floor; someone came by with a rag, did a few swipes, and left the worst spots unchanged. It gave the place a used-up feel even though the linens were fresh.",
        "source_3": "The lighting setup made it hard to get anything done in the evenings. The ceiling fixture cast a weak, yellowish glow, and the desk area had no dedicated task lamp, so reading documents felt like a strain. One bedside lamp flickered intermittently, and the bathroom mirror was shadowy enough that shaving took longer than usual. I tried opening the curtains for natural light, but by late afternoon the room still felt dim.",
        "source_4": "I had several basic questions and kept getting roundabout answers. The front desk couldn’t tell me the overnight parking rate without putting me on hold twice, and I received two different time frames for late checkout depending on who I spoke with. When I asked for directions to the nearest train stop, I was handed a printed map that pointed me to the wrong entrance; Google Maps saved me ten minutes of backtracking. Everyone was polite, but I never felt confident in the information I was given.",
        "source_5": "Weekend stay on a high floor facing the courtyard: I slept through the night without hallway noise, and the room itself was generously sized with a comfortable mattress. Check-in moved quickly and the lobby seating made it easy to meet up with friends. The lighting felt on the softer side, which I didn’t mind for winding down, and the shower water pressure was steady. For the rate I paid, the space and location carried the experience.",
        "source_6": "I chose this place expecting a 4.5‑star experience, and the overall feel didn’t match that label. The room was big, but the scuffed walls and dim fixtures made it look tired, and bar music bled into the corridor past 11 p.m. When I asked about airport transit options and late checkout, I got uncertain or conflicting explanations. By the time I left, I’d decided to look beyond this brand for my next trip."
