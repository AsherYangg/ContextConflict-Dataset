        "source_1": "After two weeks with this iPhone, the small roadblocks wear me down. Plugging it into my ThinkPad shows the DCIM folder, but copying a big chunk of photos and videos either stalls or skips files, so I ended up installing iCloud for Windows just to get a reliable pipeline. AirDrop would be simpler, but that only helps if you own a Mac. The constant “Trust this computer?” and permission prompts break my flow when I’m trying to move stuff quickly. Battery-wise, on a typical office day with Slack, Spotify, and an hour of Maps, I’m hovering around 15% by 6 p.m. and looking for an outlet. The camera pulls off sharp daylight shots of my kids, and the stereo speakers easily fill my kitchen while I’m cooking, but the extra steps for basic tasks keep pushing me back to my old Android for anything involving files.",
        "source_2": "Battery only: I leave the house around 6:30 a.m., stream podcasts for an hour on Bluetooth during my commute, snap 40–50 photos at lunch, and handle email and messages all afternoon. After an hour of YouTube in the evening and a 30-minute video call, I’m still at about 20–25% by 11:30 p.m. No battery saver, no power bank—just standard brightness and 5G on. For my routine, it comfortably makes it through the day.",
        "source_3": "Usability only: Coming from Android, I’m bumping into walls with simple file tasks. I can’t just drag and drop my vacation videos to my Lenovo; the Files app doesn’t behave like a regular drive, and large transfers via File Explorer freeze halfway. The Photos app import is slow, and every workaround I find seems to assume I have a Mac. AirDrop is off the table for me, so I ended up setting up iCloud or dumping clips into Google Photos. Between “Trust this computer” alerts and permissions popping up repeatedly, it feels like three steps for everything I used to do in one.",
        "source_4": "Audio only: The stereo speakers surprised me. Watching YouTube in the kitchen, dialogue lands squarely in the center and music has a bit of width—enough that I can distinguish instruments without cranking the volume. At around 80% volume there’s no harsh buzz or cabinet rattle, and voice notes come through clearly during hands-free calls. Compared side by side with my partner’s midrange Android, this one sounds fuller and less tinny at the same volume.",
        "source_5": "Camera only: I carry a Sony mirrorless for serious shoots, and this phone isn’t replacing it. Daylight photos look crisp and skin tones are pleasing, but in dim restaurants fine detail on hair and fabric gets smeared. Cinematic mode is capped at 1080p on my unit—no 4K—so the clips don’t match my 4K YouTube timeline, and there isn’t much in the way of manual control. Great for quick snapshots; for controlled work, I still reach for the DSLR-style body.",
        "source_6": "As a whole package, it’s worked out well for me after the first-week learning curve. I installed iCloud for Windows and let photos sync in the background, and when I do plug in via Lightning, trusting the device and using the Windows Photos importer has been reliable. The security prompts felt heavy at setup, but once Face ID took over, I stopped noticing them. On conference days I’m off the charger at 7 a.m. and home around 10 p.m. with charge to spare. The speakers are loud enough for impromptu Zoom calls, and the camera handles kid videos and outdoor shots nicely. Cinematic mode not doing 4K isn’t ideal, but it hasn’t gotten in the way of what I actually shoot."
