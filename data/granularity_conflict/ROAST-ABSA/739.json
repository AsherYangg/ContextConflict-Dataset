        "source_1": "I stayed for five nights in May while visiting friends, and the location made getting around a breeze—the MTR entrance was literally across the street, so I was in Central in about 12 minutes with my Octopus card. My room on a high floor had floor-to-ceiling windows, blackout curtains that actually worked, and a rainfall shower with strong water pressure and quick drainage. There were plenty of outlets, including USB by the bed, and the bedside reading light was handy for late emails. Housekeeping swapped the linens daily and left extra water when I requested it in the morning. The front desk printed ferry tickets and the bell staff stored my luggage after checkout so I could squeeze in a last bowl of wonton noodles before heading to the airport. For what I paid, the comfort-to-convenience ratio felt right.",
        "source_2": "I booked a one-night layover in March and focused on getting a good sleep, but the room’s cleanliness was off. In 1207, I opened the door to a faint sour odor. The bathroom counter had toothpaste flecks, the glass shelf by the sink was streaked, and there were long hairs clinging to the shower wall. Running a tissue along the headboard ledge lifted a gray film of dust, and the carpet along the baseboard looked like it hadn’t met a vacuum that day. The AC vent had a visible layer on the slats. Housekeeping came within 15 minutes when I called and wiped surfaces, but the smell lingered, so I kept the window cracked and the fan on.",
        "source_3": "My comments are purely about the service I experienced. I arrived around 10:30 pm after a delayed flight and waited behind two guests. The front desk agent never looked up, slid a registration card toward me, and continued chatting with a colleague while I filled it out. The key card they issued didn’t work; when I returned, a different agent re-encoded it with an audible sigh and no acknowledgment. I asked for an extra duvet at 11:05 pm; after two calls to follow up, it reached my door close to midnight. During checkout, the staff member discussed my deposit hold amount loud enough for people in line behind me to hear, which felt careless with personal details.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on pricing and charges: my three-night stay in June was listed at HKD 980 per night, but the ledger grew. There’s a 10% service charge added on top, plus a small levy, and the credit card hold equaled the full stay; it took five business days to release back to my account. Laundry pricing was eye-watering—HKD 75 for a T‑shirt and HKD 55 for socks—and the lobby cafe cappuccino was HKD 58. Pushing checkout past 1 pm triggered a half-day fee. None of this is unusual for the city, but the extras stacked up in a way that changed the math for me.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on room design only: the space looked sleek at first glance, but some choices got in the way. The bedside control panel had four identical, unlabeled switches, so I had to play light-switch roulette to figure out what turned off the reading lamps. The only USB port by the bed was loose; my phone disconnected twice overnight. Storage was tight—two shallow drawers and a half-height hanging space—so my suitcase lived open on the floor. The glass bathroom door didn’t seal, letting steam and light spill into the sleeping area, and the shower had a fixed head with limited range, which made rinsing awkward.",
        "source_6": "I did a weekend food crawl in Hong Kong and picked this hotel for the easy transit links. Having an MTR exit across the road and trams on the next block meant I never waited long to move around. My corner room was compact but well laid out, with a firm mattress, a quiet AC unit, and double glazing that kept street sounds muted. I slept through both nights without issue. The concierge circled dim sum spots on a paper map, booked us a last-minute table in Sheung Wan, and pointed out the easiest route to the airport bus. Check-in and checkout were straightforward, and I’d stay here again for a short city break."
