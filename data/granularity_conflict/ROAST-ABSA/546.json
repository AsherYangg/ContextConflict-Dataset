        "source_1": "I enrolled right after finishing another course in the same specialization, and the material here felt like an orientation rather than a step up. Most videos were 5–7 minutes with definitions and a single slide example, and the quizzes leaned on recall (matching terms, picking a definition) instead of applying ideas to a scenario. There wasn’t a project or any hands-on work, so I wrapped it up in one sitting without feeling like I’d practiced anything new.",
        "source_2": "I paid the $49 for this one separately, thinking there would be at least a small project or case study. What I got was a short set of lectures and a couple of auto-graded quizzes. For a standalone purchase, I expected more than a certificate and a few checkpoints; the deliverables didn’t line up with the price.",
        "source_3": "I used this as a reset after a few months away from the specialization. The instructor kept the explanations tight, the slides clarified the jargon, and the end-of-module checks helped me see what I’d forgotten. I finished it over a weekend on the monthly subscription and went straight into the next course without losing momentum, which is exactly what I needed as a returning learner.",
        "source_4": "From a value angle, the time savings mattered more to me than depth. I spent around three hours total and got a clear overview without hunting through random YouTube playlists. Since I’m on a subscription, finishing it quickly let me start the next, heavier course in the same billing cycle, which made the pacing and cost work in my favor.",
        "source_5": "The content coverage is very narrow. It touches a couple of core topics at a surface level—definitions, a few toy examples—and then moves on. The course is labeled for multiple weeks, but I completed everything in an afternoon. I was hoping for at least one real-world walkthrough or a dataset to practice with, and those pieces never showed up.",
        "source_6": "As an overall experience, it’s polished—clean audio, tidy slides, downloadable notes—but the learning activities are minimal. I ended up supplementing with a few YouTube videos to see more involved examples. Bundled in the specialization, it serves as a quick refresher, but if you’re expecting deeper exploration or a capstone-style assignment, you’ll need to look elsewhere."
