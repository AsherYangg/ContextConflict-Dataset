        "source_1": "I focus on the foam, and with my Tassimo T47 I get a thick cap every time. I keep the creamer discs in the fridge, give them a 10–12 second shake, and use an 8 oz mug. The pour comes out creamy with tight bubbles that sit on top of an espresso disc for several minutes, and when I pop the disc out it’s basically empty—no sloshing or drips in the holder.",
        "source_2": "My issue is that the disc never fully drains. I can hear liquid still swishing around, and when I eject it there’s easily a third left inside that ends up splattering the counter and the drip tray. I tried three sleeves, cleaned the barcode window, and even ran a descaling cycle on my T20; same thing. The Gevalia latte milk discs I’ve used empty cleanly in comparison, so this felt wasteful and messy.",
        "source_3": "For an overall take: I switched from half-and-half to these to cut calories, and they’ve become part of my weekday routine. One creamer disc after a bold espresso T Disc gives a mild sweetness and a smooth mouthfeel, and I like that the sleeves store well in a desk drawer without going bad quickly. Cleanup is just a quick rinse of the holder, and I haven’t had foaming overflow or sticky residue on the brew head. Cost per cup is reasonable versus the café down the street, and the results have been consistent across two boxes.",
        "source_4": "Broadly, this didn’t work out for me. The texture comes out thin, there’s almost no foam crown, and the cup tastes more like watered-down milk than what I expect from a creamer disc. I tested six discs on a T55 after doing the cleaning cycle, and four of them left a milky puddle inside the pod that splashed when I removed it. I went back to the standard latte creamer discs because they give a richer body and don’t leave the same mess.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on temperature: the creamer stream dispenses noticeably cooler than the espresso shot on my machine, which knocks my drink down to lukewarm if I don’t prep. If I preheat the mug with a blank cycle and start the creamer disc immediately after the espresso, the final cup lands closer to the heat I like; skipping the preheat gives a flatter, cooler sip and the foam collapses faster. So for me, temperature management is the make-or-break variable with these."
