        "source_1": "I booked the Four Seasons for the last two nights of my week in Mexico City and it turned into a little ritual: late afternoon check-in, a stroll through the courtyard, and dinner on Reforma. The front desk had me upstairs in under five minutes, and my room looked into the central garden with the fountain quietly running. I walked to Chapultepec in about 15 minutes and grabbed an espresso at a cafe two blocks away. The concierge set up a 6 a.m. car to the airport, and the driver was waiting in the driveway when I came down with my bags. From the lobby scent to the calm in the garden, it felt like a pause button after the city’s pace.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing purely on the location: staying on Reforma meant heavy traffic and late-night sirens most evenings. On Sunday morning the avenue turns into a bike route, which is great in theory, but it forced my taxi to circle for 20 minutes to pick me up on a side street. Crossing the intersections with a stroller took forever because of long lights and wide lanes. It wasn’t unsafe, but it was not the effortless “step outside and go” I’d hoped for. If you’re planning quick rides, factor in frequent road closures near the roundabouts.",
        "source_3": "I only want to talk about the entrance and signage, because that’s where my issue was. My Uber driver passed the building twice—there’s a discreet facade and the driveway is partially hidden behind trees, so it looks like another office block. I got out to walk and literally went by the gate without realizing it; the doorman waved me back from halfway down the sidewalk. Check-in was fine once I made it, but the first impression was confusion and a bit of unnecessary back-and-forth in the heat.",
        "source_4": "Over three nights, the hotel itself looked polished, but a few basics dragged the stay. My room faced Reforma; even with double glazing, horns and motorcycles cut through until around midnight. The AC cycled on and off and never quite held a steady temperature, and the shower drained slowly enough that I had to pause mid-rinse. Breakfast in the courtyard was pretty, though the pacing meant a 25-minute wait for eggs while my coffee went cold. The car to the airport arrived late because of a protest blocking the nearest intersection, so I left feeling rushed.",
        "source_5": "I’m zeroing in on the airport commute. I had an 8 a.m. flight out of AICM and asked the concierge for a sedan at 5:30; the driver took Viaducto Miguel Alemán and had me at Terminal 1 in about 25 minutes. No toll booths, no detours, and he helped with bags straight to the airline counter. Coming back two days later, the hotel arranged a pickup and the return took roughly 35 minutes in midday traffic. If you’re timing your ride, early mornings are smooth from this location.",
        "source_6": "As someone obsessed with interior atmospheres, the moment you step inside is the hook. The courtyard is ringed with orange trees and tiled walkways, and the fountain muffles the city to a soft hiss. Hallways are lined with art and fresh lilies, and the light in late afternoon makes the colonnade feel like a small hacienda. I found myself lingering after breakfast just to sit by the planters and watch the staff reset the tables. Outside it’s all buses and office towers, but inside it reads like a pocket garden."
