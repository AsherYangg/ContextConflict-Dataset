        "source_1": "I switched both my dogs to Wellness Simple Solutions Rice & Salmon after a vet suggested a limited-ingredient option for my border collie’s itchy skin. We did a gradual transition over ten days, mixing 25%, 50%, then 75% until fully on the new food. By week two, the scratching eased up and his coat didn’t have the rough patches anymore. My retriever eats without fuss and finishes in one sitting. I buy the 26 lb bag and keep it in an airtight bin; measured out at 1.5 cups twice a day for the collie and 2 cups for the retriever. The ingredient list is short and easy to read, and I’m not seeing the upset stomach we had with chicken formulas. The larger bag fits our two-dog routine without frequent reorders.",
        "source_2": "Just on price: I tracked costs over three purchases. The 26 lb bag I ordered online came to $72.99 after tax, which is roughly $2.81 per pound. My local co-op ran a promo on the 10 lb size at $19.99, bringing it to $2.00 per pound, and even the regular shelf price there is $24.99 ($2.50/lb). With online shipping fees and no bulk discount that week, the bigger bag didn’t work out as the cheapest option. If you’re feeding one small dog, the smaller bag during store sales actually beats the 26 lb bag on per-pound cost.",
        "source_3": "I bought the Rice & Salmon formula for my beagle because he reacts to a lot of fillers, but salmon turned out to be the sticking point. After about twelve days on it, he started pawing at his ears and developed a waxy discharge; the vet flagged a possible fish sensitivity. We switched him off and the ear issue settled down within a week. The ingredient panel is clean, which I appreciate, but for a dog that doesn’t tolerate fish, even a limited recipe can set off symptoms. We ended up going to a lamb-based limited formula and kept the same feeding schedule to compare.",
        "source_4": "Overall take after six weeks: my two terriers finish their bowls and don’t leave crumbs, and the kibble doesn’t have a strong odor that lingers in the kitchen. The younger one seems to have fewer flaky spots on his back than he did on a chicken blend. The older one, though, gets more gas and softer stools if I stick to the charted serving size, so I’ve scaled him back by a quarter cup per meal and added a spoon of canned pumpkin. Storage is fine; I transfer from the 26 lb bag into a sealed container because the built-in closure is flimsy. It’s been consistent from batch to batch so far.",
        "source_5": "Zooming in on kibble size and texture: my senior chihuahua has dental issues, and these pieces are on the larger, denser side for a tiny dog. I had to soak them in warm water for 15 minutes to soften them up, otherwise she worked at it and left half-chewed bits around the bowl. When softened, she eats it, but it turns into a porridge that is messy. If you’ve got a small breed with worn teeth, plan on pre-soaking or using a topper; the kibble as-is feels designed more for medium dogs.",
        "source_6": "Strictly about bag size value: the 26 lb bag looks economical on paper, but with one 20-pound dog eating 1 cup twice a day, it took us about five and a half weeks to get through it. Around week four, the kibble lost some crunch even though I kept it clipped, and the bag’s zipper strip separated from the seam. I transferred the rest into a tight bin, but the change in texture was noticeable. For our household, the 10 lb bags rotated more quickly and stayed fresher, so the bigger bag didn’t translate to better value despite the lower per-pound math."
