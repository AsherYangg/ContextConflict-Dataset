        "source_1": "I grabbed a bag of Garden of Eatin’ chips at a little natural market while passing through Flagstaff—price tag said $3.97 for an 8.1‑oz bag. The first thing I noticed was the spice blend: a warm mix that tastes like paprika and garlic with a hint of herbs. The chips were crisp without that slick film you get from heavier oils, so I could eat them straight without wiping my fingers. I’ve since ordered cases online because the crunch and seasoning hit the spot for nachos and snacking, though I still wince a bit at the per‑bag cost compared to the bargain brands in my local grocery.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing strictly on price and value here. I paid $3.97 per bag, and the one I got was 8.1 oz—about 49 cents an ounce. Late July at my store runs $4.49 for 5.5 oz, which is 82 cents an ounce, and the house brand is $2.99 for 10 oz but with mystery ingredients. On Amazon, the case discount brought mine down to around $3.35 per bag with a coupon. For an organic corn chip, the per‑ounce math made sense to me; I bought three more bags based solely on cost versus size.",
        "source_3": "Quality only: the two bags I opened last week felt off. The chips looked darker than usual and left a light sheen on my fingers, and a few had that flat, day‑old texture around the edges. Seasoning wasn’t evenly distributed—some chips were nearly plain while others were salty enough to overpower salsa. Both bags had a best‑by date still a month out (stamped L3 22:14), so I’m wondering if they sat in a warm warehouse. I finished them with chili to mask the inconsistency but wouldn’t serve them straight to guests.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, these didn’t work out for me. The first bag was half crumbs, enough that building nachos turned into a spoon‑and‑dust situation, and the second bag had lots of small triangles that broke when I dipped into guacamole. The seasoning came on strong in random pockets, which made a few bites intense and others bland. Between the fragility and the uneven flavor, I ended up using them as salad toppers rather than putting them out for game night.",
        "source_5": "I’m here for flavor only: the herb blend is the reason I keep these in the pantry. There’s a savory note—maybe oregano and cumin—that makes them tasty even without dip. The chips give a clean crunch and don’t leave me with that heavy aftertaste, so I can snack while cooking without feeling like I need to rinse my hands. When I want a quick bite, I grab a handful with hummus and that herbal pop carries the whole snack.",
        "source_6": "Big‑picture view from buying in bulk: I picked up a case for a weekend barbecue and the cost came down to just over three bucks per bag after the store promo. That made it easy to put out bowls around the patio without doing the mental math on each refill. Everyone commented on the crisp texture and the way the seasoning stands up to chunky salsa. I like that they don’t feel oily, so they worked for both dip and nachos without turning soggy mid‑party."
