        "source_1": "I booked two nights mainly to catch up on sleep between meetings, so I paid close attention to the bed. In my room on the 8th floor, the mattress felt moderately firm with a pillow‑top layer; I like a bit of resistance, and this one didn’t swallow me. The linens were crisp, and the hotel had both feather and foam pillows—two foam pillows stacked gave me the neck support I want. I drifted off within minutes and didn’t wake until my alarm, which is rare for me on the road. If anything, the bed height was slightly low, but overall it worked well for my back.",
        "source_2": "I relied on the concierge twice for taxis during a trade show week. At 6:45 a.m., they called a car for me to the convention center and it pulled up in about seven minutes; they suggested avoiding the main boulevard because of lane closures and the driver confirmed it saved time. That evening, I asked for a ride to a dinner across town and the concierge checked both a local dispatch and an app, then walked outside to flag one directly—no waiting beyond a couple of minutes. They also printed a quick list of nearby late‑night eateries and circled the ones still serving after 10. For an airport pickup at 5:15 a.m., the pre‑booked car arrived at 5:10 on the dot.",
        "source_3": "The location threw me off a bit. I came in on the metro and the nearest stop was a 20‑minute walk uphill with two tricky crosswalks, not fun with a carry‑on and laptop bag. Traffic around the hotel was heavy in the evenings, so crossing the street to the rideshare pickup zone took patience. After midnight the area felt quiet but sparse, with only one small convenience store still open; getting a snack meant a longer walk than I expected. It’s fine if you’re driving, but for transit users and pedestrians, it’s not the easiest base.",
        "source_4": "I stayed three nights and spent most of the time in the room catching up on emails between meetings. The room itself felt fresh—no stale smell, plenty of outlets near the desk and bed, and the blackout curtains actually kept the morning sun out. The bed leaned on the soft side, so I tucked a rolled bath towel under my lower back and that did the trick; housekeeping brought an extra pillow within ten minutes when I asked. I liked being able to walk to a pharmacy and a coffee shop within five minutes, though rush‑hour traffic made crossing the main road a little slow. I asked the concierge about a cab once and ended up using rideshare because they warned me the dispatch was backed up; not a huge deal, just quicker to tap the app.",
        "source_5": "My overall take after a weekend stay: the lobby looked modern and the room had a clean feel, but the bed sank more than I’m used to and I woke up with a stiff back both mornings. Getting a taxi to a dinner reservation was a headache—front desk took my request, but thirty minutes later I was still in the lounge watching other guests head out; I finally grabbed a rideshare on my phone. The hotel sits near a big intersection, so there’s constant honking at night, and even with the windows closed I could hear it faintly. The shower pressure was solid and the Wi‑Fi handled video calls, yet the combination of a spongy mattress and unpredictable transport made the stay more work than rest."
