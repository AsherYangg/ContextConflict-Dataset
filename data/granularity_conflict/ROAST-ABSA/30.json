        "source_1": "I finished the course over three evenings. The syllabus walks from problem framing to deployment using a CRISP-DM style arc. The examples—customer churn and a cautionary A/B testing case—helped me connect the steps. There isn’t much coding, but the flow from EDA to feature selection to model evaluation is coherent. The instructor kept momentum with quick polls and short case recaps, and I walked away with a solid mental map of the lifecycle.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically for hands-on practice and found almost no technical depth. Assignments were reflections and auto-graded quizzes; there were no notebooks, datasets, or step-by-step builds. Concepts like confusion matrices and ROC were named but never computed, and we didn’t touch scikit-learn pipelines or hyperparameter tuning. If you’re looking to write code or run experiments, you won’t find it here.",
        "source_3": "I tried to get help in Week 2 about handling class imbalance with SMOTE versus class weights and never got a response from the instructor. Most threads in the forum were students talking to each other, and the only staff touchpoint was a pinned FAQ. The “office hours” turned out to be pre-recorded clips, so there wasn’t a way to ask follow-up questions about my dataset.",
        "source_4": "The instructor showed strong command of the process. In the evaluation module, they contrasted precision and recall with a medical screening example, then walked through how threshold choice shifts when false negatives are costly. The ethics segment covered sampling bias and explained drift monitoring after deployment, including a quick demo of population stability metrics. Those details helped me understand trade-offs beyond just model accuracy.",
        "source_5": "I completed the course as a mid-career analyst. The presenter’s pacing and explanations are clear, but the material stays at 10,000 feet. After finishing the quizzes, I couldn’t point to a new technique I’d use at work the next morning. Newcomers will likely appreciate the road map; for someone already building models, the takeaways felt too light."
