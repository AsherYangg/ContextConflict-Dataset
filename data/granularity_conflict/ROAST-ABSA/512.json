        "source_1": "Over the past week, I’ve had multiple calls where the phone rings and vibrates but the display stays completely dark. Pressing the power button, double-tapping, and plugging in a charger didn’t wake it. The brightness slider was unresponsive the few times I managed to unlock blindly with the fingerprint sensor. On one morning commute, the panel stayed black for nearly two hours and then suddenly lit up without me doing anything. I’ve turned off adaptive brightness and disabled the pocket mode thinking it was a proximity issue, but the behavior repeats.",
        "source_2": "I’ve been using this for about five months with heavy multitasking—Maps running while streaming music, WhatsApp and email in the background, and frequent camera use. I keep a lot of apps cached and switch between them throughout the day, and the interface doesn’t stall. Even during a 45-minute Zoom call with screen sharing, it stayed responsive. The only reboot I’ve done was after a system update, not due to any freeze.",
        "source_3": "Day to day, the device locks up at random, and then the display goes inert for long stretches. I’ve missed calls because I can hear the ringtone but the screen won’t wake to let me answer. I took it to the authorized center twice; they opened the unit and reseated the display cable, and it seemed fine for a couple of days. By the end of the week, the blackout episodes returned, sometimes lasting hours. Warranty is still active, so I’m keeping all the job sheets, but it’s the same trip back and forth with no long-term relief.",
        "source_4": "I brought mine to the service centre after a single blackout incident. They checked the IMEI against the warranty, ran diagnostics, and decided to replace the display flex on the spot. I tested everything before leaving—calls, alarms, the brightness control, and the proximity sensor during a call—and the screen woke instantly each time. It’s been three weeks of normal use, including travel and lots of photos, and the panel hasn’t gone dark again. They even followed up two days later to confirm it was behaving.",
        "source_5": "After four months, the device has been steady overall. The interface feels quick, games load without long waits, and the screen stays readable even under direct sun. Incoming calls light the display immediately, and the proximity sensor dims only when the phone is against my ear. A silicone case once interfered with the sensor, but trimming the edge fixed it. Battery makes it from 7 a.m. through late evening with navigation and camera sessions, and I haven’t needed to visit a service desk.",
        "source_6": "My main gripe is the display going off for hours after a freeze that usually happens post-video calls. About twice a week, the phone rings but the panel doesn’t light, so I end the call by guessing with the side button. Safe mode and a factory reset didn’t change it. I’ve noticed it’s more frequent on humid days; if I leave the phone alone on the desk, the screen eventually comes back by itself, sometimes after two or three hours."
