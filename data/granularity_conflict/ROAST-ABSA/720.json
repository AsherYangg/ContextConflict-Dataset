        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the camera and have been testing it hard for a month. Daylight shots are crisp with good dynamic range; the green of park trees doesn’t turn neon, and cloud detail holds up. Indoors, I shot my kid’s birthday under warm bulbs and the skin tones looked natural without that waxy look. Night mode brightens alley scenes without turning the sky gray, and portrait edge detection around hair is tidy. Video at 4K stabilizes well while walking, though the mic picks up wind. The front camera smooths faces more than I’d like, but for travel and family photos, it’s been a reliable pocket shooter.",
        "source_2": "After about seven months, SIM 1 started disappearing mid-call. My Jio card would show “No service” randomly while Airtel in the second slot kept working. I swapped SIMs between slots, reset network settings, even tested in safe mode—same behavior. The tray doesn’t feel loose, yet the phone sometimes fails to detect any card until a full reboot. The service center kept it for 10 days and replaced the SIM module, but the dropout returned the following week. Calls to customer care cycle through the same troubleshooting script, and I now carry a basic backup phone for important calls.",
        "source_3": "Been using this as my daily driver for nine months and it’s been smooth overall. The emerald finish still looks fresh, and the curved back sits well in one hand. Dual SIM with Jio and Vi works as expected; I commute through patchy areas and the device latches onto 4G/5G quickly without call drops. Photos are sharp enough for social posts, the display stays readable in bright sun, and the battery consistently lasts a full workday plus an evening of streaming. No visits to the service desk so far, and the phone hasn’t heated up even during long navigation sessions.",
        "source_4": "I care most about design, and this one nails the details. The matte glass diffuses fingerprints, the camera bump aligns flush with my slim case, and the buttons have a solid click with no wobble. It’s light enough not to fatigue my wrist on long chats, and the subtle curve on the edges makes swiping from the sides effortless. The front bezels are even, the earpiece grille is neatly machined, and the color coating on the frame hasn’t chipped despite a few desk slides. If you’re into minimal hardware that still feels premium in the hand, this checks the right boxes.",
        "source_5": "My unit started strong but aged poorly after the first year. The camera struggles under indoor lighting, with textures turning smudgy and autofocus pulsing during video of moving subjects; outdoor results are fine, but evening restaurant shots need multiple tries. Around the same time, the phone stopped recognizing my Jio SIM in slot 2 unless I reseated the tray, and sometimes neither slot detected any card after a firmware update. The repair queue at the authorized center took two weeks, and the diagnosis kept changing from software to hardware. Between the inconsistent photos and the flaky SIM detection, I’ve lost confidence using it as my main device."
