        "source_1": "I bought this tea for weekday mugs and focused on dialing in the hot steep. With 1 teaspoon per 8 ounces at about 205°F for 3 minutes, the cup came out with a pithy edge that dried my tongue, especially along the sides. Dropping to 2 minutes softened it a little, but there was still a noticeable bite that lingered into the aftertaste. Even adding a lemon slice didn’t fully round it out, which surprised me since other black teas I brew at the same ratio don’t get that scratchy.",
        "source_2": "My interest is only in iced tea, so I tested it strictly as a cold brew. I used 2 tablespoons in a 1-liter Hario bottle with filtered water, 12 hours in the fridge. The color was pale and the flavor felt hollow, like lightly tinted water. I re-ran it at double the leaf and 16 hours; stronger for sure, but a metallic, slightly tannic note crept in that made it less refreshing. For iced pitchers on hot afternoons, I need something that carries more body without turning sharp.",
        "source_3": "As a daily drinker, this hits the spot for me. I scoop a heaping teaspoon into a mesh basket, pour just-off-boil water, and let it go 3–4 minutes; the cup lands smooth and easy, without the tongue-curling finish I dread in some blends. It doesn’t ask for sugar, and a splash of milk plays nicely without muting the flavor. I also keep a quart jar steeping in the fridge overnight; poured over ice with a slice of orange, it stays clean and mellow through lunch refills. Friends who usually reach for sweet tea keep asking for another glass of this as-is.",
        "source_4": "My take is on the whole purchase experience, not just the brew. The pouch arrived with a zipper that wouldn’t seal, and the seam started shedding fine leaf dust after a couple of openings. The leaves inside were heavily broken, bordering on fannings, which led to a murky cup even with a fine infuser. The aroma out of the bag was faint, and the resulting liquor tasted thin and a bit papery compared to the loose leaf I pick up at a local shop. After a week, whatever scent it had left seemed to fade, and the last few cups felt tired.",
        "source_5": "I evaluate teas by how forgiving they are with bitterness when I’m distracted at work. This one stayed gentle even when I accidentally let it go past 5 minutes at roughly 200°F. No tongue scrape, no puckering at the finish, just a straightforward, rounded sip. It also handled a second steep without turning harsh, which is rare for how finely broken many bagged teas get; here, the leaves kept their composure.",
        "source_6": "Overall, it behaves like two different drinks for me. A hot mug first thing in the morning is steady and smooth, especially with a dash of honey. The iced version, however, hasn’t been dependable: my cold brew (1:12 ratio, 14 hours) looked great at first pour but turned cloudy and picked up a sharp edge after sitting in the fridge overnight. For summertime pitchers I can set and forget, I need something that holds its clarity and stays easygoing on day two."
