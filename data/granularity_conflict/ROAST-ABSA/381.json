        "source_1": "I grabbed the cashew/coconut Truebars because the packaging jumped out at me on the endcap—matte wrapper with a big photo of toasted coconut and a little window showing the bar itself. The color block for this flavor made it easy to spot, and the sale tag sealed the deal. Based on shelf appeal alone, it looks like a premium snack you’d toss into a tote without thinking twice.",
        "source_2": "I tried one at my desk and the first bite was all coconut, then a wave of sugary syrup that stuck around. The cashew presence was faint, more background than headline. Halfway through, my mouth felt coated and I was reaching for water. I ended up leaving the last few bites because the sweetness piled up fast for me.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday snack, these have worked out well. The cashew/coconut combo reminds me of a macaroon, with chewy coconut threads and little nut pieces that don’t crumble everywhere. One bar tided me over from a late morning coffee to lunch, and it pairs nicely with espresso. I think the regular price is a bit steep, so I wait for promos and pick up a couple boxes—did that again last week after finishing the first one.",
        "source_4": "I bought a single bar and cut it in half to see what’s inside: a lot of coconut shreds and glossy binder, a few small cashew chunks here and there. The texture reads more like puffed cereal bound with syrup than a nut-forward bar. I checked the ingredient list afterward, and the sweeteners show up near the top, which explains why the cashew notes don’t lead.",
        "source_5": "Picked up a box for weekend hikes. In a warm daypack, the bars softened and some oil seeped onto the wrapper, which made them messy to open on the trail. The coconut strands wedged in my teeth and lingered the whole climb. After two outings, my partner asked me to switch to something less sticky, and I ended up giving the remaining bars to a friend instead of buying another box."
