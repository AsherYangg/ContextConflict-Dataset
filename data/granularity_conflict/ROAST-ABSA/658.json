        "source_1": "I came in with about six months of Python scripting, and the pace jumped from basic Pandas Series operations to DataFrame joins and groupby in the first couple of modules. The cheat sheets and example notebooks helped me keep up, especially when I paused the videos to mirror the code. The homework ramped up each week—by week 3 I was wrangling messy CSVs and multi-indexes—and Sophie on the forums walked me through a confusing SettingWithCopy issue. The time estimates were off for me, so I planned roughly double and still finished by the final deadline without rushing.",
        "source_2": "I’m only going to talk about the homework workload: the posted estimates didn’t line up at all for me. Week 2’s assignment on cleaning missing values and fixing indexing quirks took about six hours when the page said two; week 3’s groupby/aggregation project ran close to nine. Most of that time was spent chasing chained indexing bugs and figuring out why boolean masks weren’t selecting what I expected. I started blocking entire evenings just to get through the grading scripts without failing tests.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on course pace: the lectures moved fast, and that rhythm worked well for me. We went from Series basics to multi-index DataFrames and merges without lingering too long, which kept me engaged and coding along. I routinely finished modules ahead of the suggested times by pausing, replicating each demo, and then extending it with my own datasets. If you already touch Pandas at work, the tempo feels like a brisk walkthrough rather than a slow primer.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the supplementary materials: the PDFs and notebooks felt thin. The “cheat sheets” were mostly one-liners without examples, and several notebook cells skipped showing intermediate outputs, which made it tough to follow the logic. I kept flipping to the official Pandas docs and external blog posts to grasp .loc vs .iloc nuances and broadcasting rules because the provided notes didn’t spell them out.",
        "source_5": "Only commenting on the TA support: Sophie was active on the discussion boards and consistently practical. She replied to my question about chained indexing the same afternoon with a short code snippet using .copy() and explained why my merge duplicated rows. Later she posted a checklist for boolean masks and groupby pitfalls that matched exactly what I was stumbling over, and I used her sample dataset to debug my resampling step.",
        "source_6": "As an overall impression from someone new to coding, I started with no Python background and still got through smoothly. The first week’s walkthroughs on Series and DataFrames were broken into tiny steps, and the homework estimates matched my pace—I spent about two hours per week and submitted early. The notebooks guided me through each transformation, and the auto-graded tests made it clear what was missing without sending me to the forums. I finished in three weeks by doubling up a module on a Saturday, and never felt lost."
