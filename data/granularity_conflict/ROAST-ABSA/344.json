        "source_1": "Focused on battery only: The 5000 mAh rating had me expecting easy two-day endurance, but my routine drains it faster than I thought. With 120 Hz on, AOD enabled, dual SIM, and Bluetooth connected to earbuds, I average about 4.5–5 hours of screen-on time. A typical day is 2 hours of YouTube, 1 hour of calls, 45 minutes of Maps with GPS, and lots of messaging. By 7–8 pm I’m usually at 10–15%, and I see a 7–9% drop overnight in airplane mode. Charging is quick, which helps, but in raw longevity it doesn’t outperform my older Nord as much as the number suggests.",
        "source_2": "Focused on performance only: Coming from a midrange device, this feels brisk. I installed around 110 apps, keep 8–10 in memory, and I can hop from Chrome (20+ tabs) to banking to the camera without reloads. Games like BGMI hold 60 fps over half-hour sessions, and even after a 15-minute 4K recording, the UI remains responsive. Animations stay consistent at 120 Hz, app installs don’t stall the interface, and I haven’t noticed frame drops scrolling heavy feeds. After the first OTA, it still behaves the same—no random pauses or hiccups so far.",
        "source_3": "Focused on camera only: Specs aside, the 100 MP mode produces large files but not necessarily better shots. Daylight photos look sharpened with halos around tree branches, and skin tones lean ruddy. The 6x zoom struggles with fine text—billboard letters turn to mush unless the light is perfect. In dim restaurants, Night mode lifts shadows but introduces a smeary look, and there’s a noticeable shutter lag that makes moving subjects tough—my kid sprinting across the yard is a blur half the time. Video stabilization wobbles when walking, as if it’s hunting for a horizon.",
        "source_4": "Overall take: This does feel like the OnePlus vibe I remember—snappy gestures, clean UI with minimal fuss, and a satisfying alert slider click. The display gets bright enough for noon outdoor use, haptics are crisp, and call quality is clear with solid 5G handoffs on my commute. Speakers have decent channel separation for podcasts. Battery gets me a full workday and a bit, and the bundled charger tops it up over a lunch break. I don’t see stray lags in everyday use; app switching and typing remain fluid a month in.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: Day two is when quirks crept in for me. Keyboard input occasionally lags a beat, Instagram reels stutter after a few swipes, and switching back to an app sometimes refreshes it even with plenty of free RAM showing. The phone warms during long camera sessions and then the UI slows when returning to home. Screen and speakers are enjoyable—vivid panel and clear vocals—but the chip seems to throttle under load, which makes daily multitasking feel inconsistent. If I had to choose again at this price, I’d look elsewhere.",
        "source_6": "Focused on display only: The 120 Hz smoothness is great, but my panel shows a faint green/pink tint at low brightness on gray backgrounds. In a dark room, auto-brightness tends to “breathe,” nudging levels up and down every few seconds. I’m also sensitive to PWM flicker, and after long reading sessions I get mild eye strain unless I keep brightness above 40%. Outdoors the screen is readable, yet color temperature shifts slightly off-axis. None of this is a deal-breaker alone, but it isn’t the flawless display I expected."
