        "source_1": "I approached this as an overall learning path. I’d already taken the Aerial Robotics course and I use MATLAB at work, so the pace felt workable: derivations in the videos, then coding labs that had me implement PID and trajectory tracking and inspect error plots. The schedule (five weeks for me) was steady enough to keep momentum, and the forum answers covered the few sticking points I had with state-space notation. By the end, I could move from the math in the lectures to scripts that produced sensible plots without constantly checking outside notes.",
        "source_2": "Only speaking about the assignments: the week 2 and 3 labs leaned hard on Simulink and a custom toolbox that isn’t clearly linked, and half my time went to version quirks between MATLAB Online and desktop. The autograder rejects submissions over figure names or axis labels, so I had multiple resubmits where the code ran but failed formatting checks. Most tasks were parameter tweaks on provided scripts, and there wasn’t much guidance on why a particular gain worked beyond “try a different value,” so it felt like knob-turning rather than building a tool I’d reuse.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on lecture quality: symbols switch between slides without a legend, and the instructor references results from the prior course with little recap, so I paused often to reconstruct missing steps. Audio is fine but the cadence is dense; a single equation-heavy segment can hide three assumptions, and captions sometimes omit Greek letters or subscripts. The weekly quizzes include items that weren’t shown in the videos, which pushed me to external notes to fill gaps.",
        "source_4": "My overall experience as someone new to MATLAB: the course assumes comfort with vectors, plotting, and toolbox conventions, and I spent most evenings fighting “undefined function” errors because a required package wasn’t loaded in MATLAB Online. Importing CSVs, naming figures correctly, and keeping scripts compatible with the autograder took longer than the control concepts themselves. The forum replies helped, but typically days later, so by week 3 I was mostly watching lectures and skipping the labs to avoid losing time to tooling issues.",
        "source_5": "I’m only reviewing the coding labs. The tasks had me write a PD controller from scratch, generate spline waypoints for a circular trajectory, and compare LQR versus PID on a simulated two-link arm. Starter code was minimal, so I implemented the cost function and plotting routines myself, and the autograder checked both numerical results and the figures. I finished with a set of scripts that I could drop into a personal project, including a plotting template for step responses and trajectory tracking error.",
        "source_6": "As a full package, my impression is mixed across weeks. The theory segments cover motion control derivations cleanly once you’ve done Aerial Robotics, but when I tried to follow without that background, the quadrotor examples felt abrupt. With prior MATLAB practice, the labs turn into a straightforward sequence; without it, the first two weeks are a slog through environment setup and figure formatting. Time-wise, I needed 6–8 hours per week to keep up, and adding the prerequisite before this course would have saved me the extra troubleshooting."
