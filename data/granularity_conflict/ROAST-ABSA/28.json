        "source_1": "I traded in my old device and have been on this one for a month. For day-to-day stuff and quick gaming sessions (BGMI at 60 fps and CoD Mobile on high graphics), it stays responsive. Battery gets me from 7 a.m. to late evening with navigation, WhatsApp, and an hour of YouTube, and it tops up from single digits to 100% in about 55 minutes with the in-box charger. It pulled the Android 13 update right after setup and hasn’t warmed up on me even during long calls or hotspot use.",
        "source_2": "My feedback is purely about storage. I bought the 128 GB version assuming I’d drop in a microSD later, but there’s no slot. After restoring WhatsApp (24 GB), downloading Spotify offline playlists (18 GB), and caching a season on Netflix (11 GB), Settings > Storage shows 113 GB used out of 128 GB on day one. I keep getting “Storage almost full” warnings when recording longer clips and had to start offloading to a USB-C OTG drive. I wish this had been clearer in the listings and reviews.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the camera: in daylight, the main lens does fine with buildings and flowers, but indoor shots under warm lights make faces look a bit waxy, and hair detail smears when people move. Night mode brightens scenes but introduces a watercolor effect on tree leaves. Video stabilization helps while walking, yet the focus breathes under street lamps and pans look wobbly. I’m hoping a tuning update can fix the processing quirks because the hardware seems capable.",
        "source_4": "This is strictly about the speaker and build resonance. At 80–100% volume, the back panel vibrates near the top-left corner by the camera island. On bass-heavy tracks (e.g., Billie Eilish’s “bad guy” or a 40–60 Hz test tone on YouTube), there’s a noticeable buzz when the phone is on a wooden table. If I press a finger on that spot, the buzz stops. Below 60% volume it’s not noticeable, and calls on the earpiece don’t trigger it.",
        "source_5": "I bought it mainly for the processor and game on it every evening. Genshin Impact at 60 fps with medium settings and motion blur off holds between 58–60 fps over a 45-minute session; CPU Monitor reports 39–41°C, and frame times stay flat with no visible stutter. CoD Mobile runs smooth on Very High + Max frame rate, and even after back-to-back matches the chassis only feels mildly warm. No throttling alerts, and the touch response stays consistent.",
        "source_6": "After the second week and an Android 13 security patch, my experience shifted. Battery now drops from 100% at 8 a.m. to around 20% by 6 p.m. with roughly 3 hours of screen time, and a full charge takes closer to 70–75 minutes using the bundled brick. Fifteen to twenty minutes of Asphalt 9 heats the area around the camera enough that I notice it through a thin case. On the plus side, my unit’s speaker remains clean at max with no panel buzz, and the dual-SIM tray in mine accepts a microSD card—I added a 128 GB card and it mounted immediately."
