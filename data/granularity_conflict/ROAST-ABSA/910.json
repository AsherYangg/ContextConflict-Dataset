        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the downloadable materials, and that part let me down fast: the Week 1 reading list had three dead links, the slide PDFs looked like low-res screenshots with fuzzy text, and the Week 3 dataset was missing a column referenced in the lab instructions. The Jupyter notebook for the second assignment had a “TODO” section that never got resolved, and two of the “recommended articles” were behind paywalls without alternatives. I spent more time hunting for working resources than actually studying.",
        "source_2": "I completed the course over four weeks while working full-time, and the format fit easily into my schedule. The videos sat in the 8–12 minute range, the instructor walked through a bike-sharing dataset step by step, and the coding labs felt like a guided tour rather than a dump of files. The capstone had me build a small dashboard and present findings, and the discussion forum replies came within a day when I got stuck on a plotting library. Even the quick worksheets after each module helped me capture takeaways without having to rewatch everything.",
        "source_3": "I tried to stick with the sequence, but the pacing wore me down. Week 2 spent a solid 25 minutes restating terms that were already covered in Week 1, and many segments were just talking over slides without live demos. The quizzes leaned on simple recall rather than applying concepts, and the peer assignment rubrics felt so generic that feedback didn’t move my project forward. I ended up playing the lectures at 1.5x speed just to get through the repetition.",
        "source_4": "If someone is joining mostly for study aids, the resource pack is the highlight. Every module had companion notes with code snippets, there was a tidy GitHub repo with clearly named folders, and the datasets came with a data dictionary that saved me from guessing column meanings. The reading list pointed to accessible blog posts and open papers, and the cheat sheets for common functions were the kind I actually printed and kept next to my laptop. I didn’t need to leave the platform to find clarifications.",
        "source_5": "I’ve taken several courses on the platform, and this one felt like a step down compared to those that use real case studies and stakeholder narratives. The examples were mostly toy scenarios, quizzes repeated phrasing from the lectures, and the peer reviews often boiled down to “looks good” without concrete suggestions. The discussion board stayed quiet, and the instructor’s check-ins were sporadic enough that I stopped expecting them. By the time the final project rolled around, I wasn’t taking much away beyond what I already knew.",
        "source_6": "Narrowly on instruction clarity: the walkthroughs on query syntax and data cleaning were easy to follow, with the instructor typing live and explaining why each command mattered. I appreciated the gentle ramp from SELECT to JOINs, and the lab had an interactive sandbox where mistakes were caught with hints rather than cryptic errors. The step-by-step demos meant I could mirror the process and understand reasoning, not just copy code."
