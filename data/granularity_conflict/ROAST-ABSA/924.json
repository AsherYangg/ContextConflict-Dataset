        "source_1": "I picked this up mainly to see how it handles multitasking and games. With WhatsApp, Gmail, Instagram, Google Fit, and two banking apps running, switching between them gives brief freezes—opening the camera from the lock screen takes around 2–3 seconds, and in PUBG Mobile on “balanced” graphics I see frame drops during squad fights (using Android’s “Profile GPU rendering” shows frequent spikes). Typing fast in Chrome occasionally misses characters until the keyboard catches up, which I don’t see on my older Snapdragon 730 phone.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the Google Fit sensor because I walk daily. On a 2,000‑step test where I counted aloud, the phone in my jeans pocket logged 1,986 steps, and my Garmin watch logged 1,992—close enough that I’d trust either. On a 4 km evening walk, Google Fit showed 3.98 km while the watch showed 4.02 km. Even stair climbing was detected consistently (12 floors up recorded as 11 on the phone, 12 on the watch). I’m not seeing the large mismatch others mention.",
        "source_3": "After two weeks with this device at ₹10,999, the experience has been largely hassle‑free: the screen renders text sharply, YouTube streams and Spotify keep playing while I jump between Maps, WhatsApp, and the browser, and I haven’t run into sluggish behavior during day‑to‑day use. The one oddity is activity tracking—Google Fit regularly shows about a quarter fewer steps than my partner’s Galaxy M31 and my Mi Band during identical walks in the neighborhood. Outside of that quirk, the phone has handled my routine without drama.",
        "source_4": "I’m sensitive to displays, so I tested this screen across different scenarios. Indoors, it’s fine for reading, but outdoors at noon I have to max brightness and still squint; adaptive brightness also hunts in and out of clouds. The default color temperature is on the cool side (skin tones look a bit pale), and in dark Netflix scenes blacks appear more like deep gray—typical of non‑OLED panels. Switching to the “Warm” color profile helps, but HDR playback doesn’t pop the way it does on my friend’s M31.",
        "source_5": "Using it as my daily driver, I keep running into small frustrations that stack up: the single loudspeaker gets tinny past 80% volume, Maps plus Uber causes noticeable pauses when a notification arrives, and battery dropped from 100% to 43% over a workday with about 4 hours screen‑on time (mostly Slack, email, and YouTube). Google Fit also misclassifies bumps in a rideshare as steps; I ended a 30‑minute car ride with 600 “steps” added. For my workflow, these quirks make the phone feel unpredictable."
