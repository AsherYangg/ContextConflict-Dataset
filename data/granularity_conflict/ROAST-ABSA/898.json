        "source_1": "I finished the course last week. The topic is fascinating, but the way the weeks were arranged left me confused. Week 2 jumped from Carolingian sources to 15th‑century court records with only a brief bridge in between. The weekly objectives felt broad, and the quizzes tested trivia (dates and names) rather than ideas discussed in the lectures. The witch trial segment in the opening lectures had vivid stories, yet later weeks leaned on sweeping claims with fewer concrete examples. I also struggled with the platform side: captions drifted out of sync on two videos, and responses in the discussion forum sat for days without instructor follow‑up. By the end I was relying on outside articles to tie it all together.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled mainly for the reading materials, and I focused on those. The course offered scans of manuscripts with marginalia, short excerpts from the Malleus Maleficarum, and a curated list of secondary sources. The footnotes helped with Latin terms like maleficium and divinatio, and the slide decks included clear diagrams of astrological houses. The only hitch was inconsistent translation choices between weeks (one lecture said “mage,” another “magus”), which made cross‑referencing a bit clumsy. If you’re here for source packets and visuals, that component is rich enough to work through even without watching every video.",
        "source_3": "I’m commenting solely on the teaching team. One instructor delivered most lectures in a steady monotone and read verbatim from dense slides, which made longer videos feel like an endurance test. Live Q&A was advertised but ended up being pre‑recorded segments with screened questions, and on the forum the replies from staff were often one‑liners like “please see week 3.” I did appreciate the brief anecdote about university condemnations in 1277—those moments of storytelling stood out—but I kept wishing for more guided discussion and fewer slide dumps.",
        "source_4": "I took the course specifically for the astrology portion and watched those sections twice. The lectures referenced ascendants, lots, and ephemerides without showing how to compute or read them, and there was no walk‑through of a chart from a medieval almanac. We moved from Ptolemy to late medieval practitioners in about ten minutes, so the chronology blurred. Even the assignment on star lore asked for reflections rather than a concrete exercise. If you’re hoping for a hands‑on demonstration of methods, that part feels like a survey rather than instruction.",
        "source_5": "I approached it as a general overview of magic in the Middle Ages and stuck to the suggested pace. Each week tied social context to specific cases—university condemnations, village healing rituals, and legal records—so the narrative built steadily. The quizzes matched the lectures, and the final task had me analyze a pamphlet from the course archive, which was satisfying to assemble. The professors were present enough that I felt guided, and the sequence on witchcraft and stargazing stitched together better than I expected. I’d happily enroll in a follow‑up focusing on late medieval city life."
