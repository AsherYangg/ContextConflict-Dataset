        "source_1": "Focusing only on battery: I unplug this iPhone around 7 a.m., stream Spotify over Bluetooth during my commute, run Google Maps for about 45 minutes, and spend most of the day bouncing between Mail, Slack, and Safari. By 10 p.m. I’m usually sitting at 35–40% with roughly 6 hours of screen time. On lighter weekends I skip the charger and it stretches well into the next afternoon. The only time I needed a mid‑day top‑up was after a 3‑hour GPS drive with the screen at max brightness.",
        "source_2": "I bought it mainly for video, and I’m a little let down. Shooting my kid’s soccer match at 4K60, the phone warmed up and the footage developed a slight judder after about 12 minutes. Under stadium LEDs the colors shift from greenish to warm mid‑clip, and quick pans show a wobble even with stabilization on. Indoors, moving from a bright window to the hallway makes the autofocus breathe in and out on faces. For straight family clips it’s fine, but for sports or low light I’ve had better luck with my older camera.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, this iPhone has been smooth for me. I moved over with Quick Start, and within 20 minutes all my apps and settings were in place. Switching between Outlook, Safari, and Notes is instant, and I can keep podcasts updating and email syncing in the background so everything is ready when I open it. I don’t see hiccups in the Settings app, and notifications show up while the phone is in my pocket without me having to wake it.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on day‑to‑day performance: the Settings app freezes briefly whenever I jump into Wi‑Fi or Privacy, and toggling VPN gives me a spinning wheel for a couple of seconds. After an hour of Teams calls while juggling Chrome and a budgeting app, going home stutters, and occasionally notifications don’t land until I unlock, as if background refresh took a nap. I’ve tried a clean restore and even wiped the phone; the quirks keep returning.",
        "source_5": "Overall assessment after two weeks: the hardware feels solid and the display is easy on the eyes, but the battery doesn’t keep up with my workday. I start at 100% around 8 a.m., do two hours of voice calls, constant Slack, and some YouTube at lunch, and by about 3 p.m. I’m dipping under 20% and hunting for a socket. Record a few 4K clips and it falls faster, so I’ve gone back to carrying a small power bank to make it home.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on the camera, I’m impressed with video. I filmed a 25‑minute school recital in 4K with stabilization on; the footage stayed steady from the back row, faces were bright without blowing out the stage lights, and the built‑in mics picked up the piano clearly over the crowd. In dim restaurants, handheld clips look clean enough to share without editing, and the focus locks onto faces quickly even when I move around the table."
