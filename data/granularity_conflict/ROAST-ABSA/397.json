        "source_1": "I ran a little taste test at home using my last unopened jar from early 2024 (Best By 03/25) and a fresh jar delivered last week (Best By 05/26). On warm sourdough toast, the older jar had a deeper roasted note and a lingering nuttiness, while the new jar tasted lighter and a bit flatter. I picked the older jar in four out of five blind tries just by that fuller finish. I even tried adding a pinch of sea salt to the new batch to coax out more flavor, but it still didn’t bring back that toasty edge I remember.",
        "source_2": "I track macros for lunch, so the reformulation actually helps me plan. The label used to read 190 calories and 16g fat per 2-tablespoon serving; my new jar reads 160 calories and 12g fat, with protein still at 7g. Saturated fat dropped from 3g to 2g. That change lets me keep a sandwich plus an apple under 500 calories without swapping out other ingredients, and I don’t need to cut dinner carbs on workout days to make room for it.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on texture: the old version always had an oil layer that needed five minutes of stirring, and it would separate again a week later. The newer jar came uniform right out of the gate, which I appreciated, but the spread is thicker and grabs at soft bread unless I warm the knife. In energy bites, the mixture came out drier than my saved recipe notes, and I had to add an extra tablespoon of honey to get the same rollable consistency.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday staple, it’s still working for me. I go through a jar every two weeks—PB&J at noon, spoonful in a smoothie before evening rides, and a swipe on apple slices for the kids. The flavor is familiar enough that no one in the house commented on a change, and the smoother, no-stir jar is convenient at the office. Price per ounce hasn’t spiked at my store, and the new lid threads better, so I’m not wiping oil off the shelf anymore.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, the new recipe didn’t hit the spot for me. I’ve had a spoonful straight from the jar as a late-night treat for years; now the finish feels pasty and I need more jelly to make a sandwich feel balanced. On crackers, it leaves a dry coat on the palate that water doesn’t clear quickly. After finishing this jar, I’m switching back to a full-fat brand for that richer taste and smoother spread I’m used to."
