        "source_1": "I completed the Coursera UI course led by Prof Jogesh K Muppala last month. The weekly rhythm mixed short lectures with hands-on labs where we coded a navigation drawer, validated form inputs, and built a small capstone prototype. The “What mistake I made” segments walked through real errors and fixes, which made it easier for me to spot and correct my own bugs. Deadlines were clearly posted, and the auto-grader flagged things like missing alt text and inconsistent naming. I finished with a usable prototype and a checklist I now apply at work.",
        "source_2": "I joined specifically for the hands-on teaching methodology. In week 3, the instructor intentionally broke a layout and guided us through reading the console, reproducing the issue, and isolating the faulty constraint before patching it. Labs required active coding—no passive watching—and the peer validation step meant someone actually checked my ARIA roles and color contrast against WCAG guidelines. That single approach reshaped how I triage UI defects on projects.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I went in expecting current UI patterns, but many examples leaned on older Android APIs and Bootstrap 3-era conventions on Coursera. Several videos looked compressed, and code snippets were hard to read unless I slowed playback to 0.75x and went full-screen. I spent a late evening resubmitting because the auto-grader rejected whitespace and naming, and the weekly cutoff locked me out right at midnight. Discussion threads often sat without instructor input, so I relied on other learners to troubleshoot.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on the instructor: Prof Muppala’s demos move fast and pack multiple changes into short segments. I found myself rewinding a five-minute clip several times to catch the exact CSS selector he tweaked and why it fixed the cascade. I posted a question about semantic HTML and saw a community TA answer two weeks later; I never spotted a direct reply from the professor. If you’re new to UI terminology, expect to pause often to keep up.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the “What mistake I made” activity: in week 4, my peer group spotlighted my spacing and color choices during the session, and the public critique made me hesitant to share drafts afterward. I did pick up a routine for contrast checks using browser dev tools and learned to validate labels, but the segment sometimes felt more like showcasing slip-ups than structured guidance. Next time I’d prefer anonymized examples with rubrics, so the focus stays on remediation rather than the person."
