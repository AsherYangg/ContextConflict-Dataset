        "source_1": "I spent two full afternoons by the main pool and never had an issue getting fresh towels. The attendants rolled out carts midmorning and again after lunch, stacking them at both entrances. When a pile thinned out near our loungers, a staffer named Greg swapped it within minutes and even offered chilled water while he was there. I went through a swim-workout routine each day and grabbed a dry towel after every set without needing to track anyone down.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on lunch service timing. I ordered a club sandwich and iced tea from a poolside server at 12:05 p.m., was told it would be about 20 minutes, and didn’t see the food until 12:51. I checked in twice as my kid got restless in the sun; both times I heard “it’s coming out now.” When it finally arrived, the fries had cooled off noticeably, which happens when food sits in a window. If you’re planning to eat by the pool around noon, budget extra time.",
        "source_3": "I went specifically for the rib eye at the on-site grill and was impressed. Mine was a 14-ounce cut, ordered medium-rare, and it came with a great crust and a warm red center. The seasoning was balanced, no gristle, and the steak stayed juicy through the last bites. The server did a quick temperature check at the table, brought a sharper steak knife without being asked, and I paired it with a glass of cabernet—zero complaints about the cook or flavor.",
        "source_4": "Three-night stay over a holiday weekend didn’t go smoothly. We arrived just before 3 p.m., but our room wasn’t ready until after 5; the front desk handed us drink vouchers, but two hours in the lobby isn’t how we wanted to start. At the pool, only a couple of servers seemed to be working our entire section, so it took about 40 minutes for a simple sandwich and sodas. Midafternoon the towel stacks vanished and guests started walking around asking each other for spares. Dinner at the grill missed the mark too—the rib eye came out grey and chewy. For the rates here, the whole experience felt more hectic than it should.",
        "source_5": "Our family weekend stay ran smoothly end to end. We pulled up around 1:30 p.m. expecting to store bags, but the front desk found us a ready room in ten minutes and texted the keys. Housekeeping already had the crib and extra pillows in place. Pool staff set up an umbrella, stacked towels by our chairs, and Janelle checked on us often enough that drinks and snacks landed quickly. Dinner at the grill was paced well and my rib eye was cooked right to temp. The next day’s poolside lunch showed up in about 15 minutes. We checked out on the app in under two minutes and were on the road."
