        "source_1": "I brought my spouse and our 6-year-old for a three-night stay in June. Check-in took under five minutes, and we were in room 514 facing the pool. Housekeeping left extra towels without being asked, and the lobby had a fresh citrus scent every morning. The pool staff ran foam noodle races at 11 a.m., and my kid kept the wristband from the scavenger hunt as a souvenir. We ate at the grill by the pool twice; the grilled snapper and the kids’ pasta came out quickly, and the bill matched the menu prices. Noise after 10 p.m. was minimal, and checkout was a quick tap on the kiosk.",
        "source_2": "Focusing solely on room cleanliness: I booked a standard king and was assigned room 327. When I walked in, I found long hairs caught in the shower drain, a dusty headboard you could swipe lines through, and a sticky residue on the desk near the lamp. The bathroom mirror had water spots from a previous guest, and the grout around the tub showed dark patches. I called for housekeeping at 6:10 p.m.; they arrived around 7:00, changed the linens, and sprayed the surfaces, but the grout and the dust on the vents were left as-is. My white socks turned gray after walking barefoot on the carpet for an hour.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on service: We arrived at 2:30 p.m. with two toddlers and were told the room would be ready “right at 3.” Keys were handed over at 4:20. I requested a crib twice via the app and once at the desk; it reached the room at 9:15 p.m., missing two screws for the side rail. The front desk agent kept saying “it’s in the system” without offering a workaround. Valet directed me to self-parking through a service alley that was blocked, so I circled the block three times. The next morning our wake-up call never came, and when I asked about it, the response was a shrug and “tech is glitchy today.”",
        "source_4": "Only about the pool: The main pool is big, but water felt chilly even in the afternoon sun. The activities board listed water polo at 3 p.m. and a kids’ relay at 4, both canceled on Tuesday and Wednesday with a handwritten “staffing” note. Towel bins sat empty by 2 p.m., and attendants told us to “check back in 20.” The slide didn’t open until nearly noon because there wasn’t a second lifeguard, and several loungers were “reserved” with towels for hours without anyone using them. My kid still splashed around, but the promised schedule wasn’t followed.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on dining: Breakfast at the on-site buffet had plenty of options, but the bacon sat lukewarm and the coffee tasted thin. The omelet station moved slowly; I waited about 20 minutes for two eggs with peppers. For dinner at the Italian spot, the kids’ menu was limited to nuggets, pasta with butter, or cheese pizza. Our server was friendly, but entrées came out 40 minutes after ordering, and the check took another 25 minutes to arrive even though the room was half full. For the price, I expected hotter food and quicker pacing.",
        "source_6": "Overall impression as a couple: My partner and I booked a weekend hoping for a quiet break. Our balcony overlooked the splash pad, which meant squeals and whistles from 9 a.m. onward. Music from the pool bar carried up to the fifth floor until about 10:30 p.m., and the hallway had a steady stream of families returning from the arcade area after dark. The “romance” package included a bottle on arrival, but it was delivered at 8:45 p.m. after two reminder calls. The property seems built around families, which made it tricky to find a calm corner to unwind."
