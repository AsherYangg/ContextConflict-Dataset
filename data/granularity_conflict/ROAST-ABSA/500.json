        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for long shifts and the battery has been a workhorse for me. Unplug at 6:45 a.m., Bluetooth earbuds on for a 90-minute commute streaming Spotify at about 60% volume, two 30-minute speaker calls, an hour of Maps with GPS, Slack and Gmail pushing all day, and a couple of photos here and there. By 10:30 p.m., I’m typically sitting at 35–40%. Screen-on-time has hovered around 6–7 hours this week, and standby drain is about 2–3% overnight with Wi‑Fi and LTE on.",
        "source_2": "A few times a week, Instagram Reels and YouTube play video but there’s no sound at all. Volume keys show the media slider moving, ringer mode is normal, and the app isn’t muted inside the player. Toggling Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb, and the speaker output doesn’t change anything. If I plug in wired earbuds, audio works; after unplugging, it goes silent again. The only thing that consistently restores sound to the phone speaker is a reboot. I cleared cache/data for both apps and even reinstalled them, but the issue returns after a day or two.",
        "source_3": "After a month as my primary device, day-to-day use has been smooth. I run two SIMs (work/personal), watch a lot of short videos and long YouTube reviews in the evenings, and the audio track starts right away every time without me having to restart anything. When calls come in, the full caller card pops up almost instantly, even if I’m mid‑scroll on Instagram or playing Alto’s Odyssey, and the swipe-to-answer responds right away. I usually end my day with 10–20% left and top up during breakfast; a 30W brick takes it from roughly 15% to full in under an hour.",
        "source_4": "The call screen is sluggish for me. I’ll be scrolling Facebook or switching between Chrome tabs, the ringtone starts, but the caller ID and answer/decline UI don’t appear for about 5–8 seconds. During that window, I can hear it ringing but there’s nothing to tap on. Once the banner finally shows up, I can pick up normally. It’s less noticeable when the screen is off; the lockscreen UI appears faster. I disabled battery optimizations for the Phone and Contacts apps, cleared their cache, and the behavior still shows up a couple of times every day.",
        "source_5": "On the latest patch, I’m not seeing any audio quirks in social apps—Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify all play sound immediately on the phone speaker and through my Galaxy Buds without cutting out. Calls also surface right away on top of whatever I’m doing, with the name and number visible as soon as it rings. What’s been rough is endurance: one hour of Reels drops me from around 80% to about 50%, and by 3–4 p.m. I’m hunting for a charger. Overnight standby with Wi‑Fi and LTE left on eats roughly 10–12%, which adds up if I forget to plug in."
