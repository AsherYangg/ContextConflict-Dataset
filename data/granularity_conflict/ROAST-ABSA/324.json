        "source_1": "I’m picky about screens, so I focused on the display for the first week. Indoors it looks fine, but out on a sunny patio the brightness tops out and I still have to shade it with my hand to read messages. Whites lean a bit warm compared to my laptop, and the auto-brightness keeps jumping up and down when I move between rooms. Tilt it a little and the colors shift enough that photos lose punch, and small text looks slightly fuzzy at low brightness, almost like there’s a light haze over it.",
        "source_2": "My notes on battery life after five workdays: Wi‑Fi at home and office, 4G during a 40‑minute commute, about 1.5 hours of YouTube, 30–40 minutes of calls, constant messaging, and some light browsing. Screen-on time lands around 5.5–6 hours and I’m ending the day with roughly 18–25% left without any mid‑day top‑ups. No gaming, just typical productivity and social, and it keeps up without me hunting for a charger before bedtime.",
        "source_3": "I tested the included charger with a wall power meter. From 8% to 100% took me 1 hour 11 minutes consistently over three tries. It sprints to 50% in about 20 minutes, then crawls; the last 10% alone takes close to 15 minutes. The phone gets toasty near the camera area (my infrared gun showed around 39–40°C at peak). Swapping to a third‑party cable didn’t help, and even with the bundled cable I couldn’t get anywhere near a full charge in half an hour.",
        "source_4": "After two weeks as my main phone, it does the day‑to‑day stuff smoothly—messaging, maps, banking apps, and a bit of Spotify over Bluetooth in the car. The screen is easy on the eyes indoors, the battery gets me through work without anxiety, and a quick plug while making coffee bumps it up enough to last the evening. The chassis has a reassuring feel in the hand, no flex, and the finish hasn’t picked up scratches in my pocket with keys. For the price I paid, it’s been a dependable everyday carry for non‑gamers.",
        "source_5": "I wanted this as my all‑in‑one device for work and evening gaming, but it hasn’t panned out. With 5G on and a couple of rounds of PUBG at medium settings, the battery falls from the 80s to the 40s before dinner, and I’m forced to top up mid‑afternoon. The fast charge is hit‑or‑miss; sometimes it ramps quickly, other times it sits at the same percentage for minutes. Indoors the screen looks fine, yet outdoors I’m squinting on job sites. Build feels solid enough, but after a week of juggling power banks and hunting for shade, I moved back to my older phone.",
        "source_6": "Focusing just on build: the phone feels sturdy in the hand and survived a slip from my lap to tile without a mark. The buttons have a distinct click, though the power key has a little lateral wobble. There’s a faint creak if I twist the corners, and the back panel picks up smudges easily, so I threw on a matte case. Weight distribution is slightly top‑heavy, which I notice when one‑hand typing, but overall the body inspires confidence for daily use."
