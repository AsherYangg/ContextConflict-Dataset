        "source_1": "I bought these for afternoon tea and they fit right in with the way I snack. The sheets are thinner than the usual graham crackers, so there’s a clean snap when you break them, and the sweetness sits back enough that a swipe of raspberry jam actually comes through. They taste distinctly of oats—almost like a mild oatmeal cookie—and when I dunked half a square into hot Earl Grey for a few seconds, it kept its crunch instead of turning mushy. I used one sleeve over five days, and they stayed crisp in the pantry without any staleness creeping in.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on sweetness: I tried these for s’mores at a backyard fire, using two squares per sandwich. The marshmallow and chocolate completely took over, and the cracker layer didn’t add much sweetness of its own. I ended up drizzling a bit of honey on the second round to balance things out, and my kids asked for the regular honey grahams next time because they missed that sugary bite.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on crunch/thinness: I like spreading cream cheese on crackers, and these kept snapping down the middle as soon as I applied pressure with the knife. The edges are so thin that they fracture into little shards, and you get a small avalanche of crumbs on the plate. Eating them plain, the crunch is loud and brittle—fun for snacking at the table, but not great in the car or for toddlers who press down while spreading peanut butter.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on oatmeal taste: The flavor leans hard into oats, with an earthy, cereal-like note that sticks around after the last bite. I paired a few squares with sharp cheddar and the oat profile clashed for me; I kept expecting that honey-graham character and never found it. My spouse reached for more, but I realized I’m not into an oat-forward cracker.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression after a full box: The crackers are thin and crisp, and the mild sweetness made them easy to pair with peanut butter and banana slices for breakfast. That said, my box had a bunch of broken pieces in the top row, and the crumb is on the dry side if you eat them plain. For me, they worked best with a topping or alongside yogurt, less so as a stand-alone snack.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on baking use: I pulsed a sleeve into crumbs for a cheesecake crust, added melted butter and a little sugar, and the mixture stayed sandy instead of packing tightly. Even after baking, the crust felt coarse and didn’t give that uniform base you usually get from classic graham crackers. The lower sweetness meant I had to compensate in the filling, and next time I’d choose a different cracker for this job."
