        "source_1": "I’m only weighing in on breakfast. I didn’t prebook it, and at check-in they quoted me 16€ per person for the buffet. I tried it one morning: a couple of hot trays (the scrambled eggs were cooling off by 9:15), cold cuts, pastries, and a self-serve coffee machine. It filled the gap, but I ended up going to a café on Gran Via the next days where a tostada, fresh OJ, and a cappuccino came to under 6€. I asked if I could switch to the 8€ rate mid-stay by booking online, but the front desk said that had to be arranged before arrival.",
        "source_2": "My take is purely about noise in the front rooms. I was on the 4th floor facing Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, and even with the double glazing I could hear scooters and a couple of late-night sirens around 2 a.m. The walls also let through plumbing sounds when the neighbor showered early. Earplugs solved most of it, but it wasn’t the hushed setup I’d hoped for. I requested a courtyard room for the last two nights, yet reception said they were full, so I stuck it out with the balcony closed and the AC on low.",
        "source_3": "Stayed six nights at Apsis Atrium Palace and came away happy with the overall setup. The location worked beautifully—airport bus to Plaça Catalunya, then a 10-minute walk, and metro stops at Passeig de Gràcia and Universitat nearby. Front desk handed me a map, circled a couple of tapas spots, and restocked four small water bottles in the room daily without me asking. I prebooked breakfast at 8€ through the hotel site and used it on busy mornings; plenty of fruit, yogurt, and a made-to-order coffee from the attendant when I asked. My room looked over the street but had heavy drapes and firm bedding, so I slept through most nights and appreciated the quick elevator and reliable Wi‑Fi for work calls.",
        "source_4": "Service notes from a short stay: I arrived at 13:30 and was told the room wouldn’t be ready until 15:00, which is fine, but the way it was delivered felt abrupt—just “come back later” and a hand wave toward the luggage room. When I finally got the key, it demagnetized twice that evening and I had to return to the desk each time; maintenance came up on the second call and tinkered with the lock for 40 minutes. No one offered a drink voucher or a different room, so I ended up waiting in the hallway. The night clerk, a younger guy with glasses, was more personable and got me fresh keys that finally worked. Housekeeping kept the room tidy, but the first impression carried through the stay.",
        "source_5": "Focused note on the “four bottles of water per day” claim. On check-in there were four half-liter bottles in the minibar, but the next day only two were replaced. I asked at reception and was told the policy had changed and they could only provide extra at check-out if there was surplus. With afternoon heat pushing 30°C, I ended up buying multi-packs at the Carrefour Express on Carrer de Pau Claris. It’s a small thing, but if you’re counting on that perk, you may want to budget for water runs."
