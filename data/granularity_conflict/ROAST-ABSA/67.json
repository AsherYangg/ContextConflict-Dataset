        "source_1": "I stayed three nights for a short city break. The spot worked well: the hotel sits right by the market, and the currency booth next door swapped my dollars with no fee. Each morning I grabbed a pastry and coffee from the stalls for under 6 euros and was on the tram in ten minutes. Check-in had one person at the desk; she was kind and handed me a map with tram routes. My room on the 4th floor looked onto a service courtyard, so there wasn’t much to see. The mattress leaned firm. Convenience won me over, and I’d book it again for the location.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the bed only: the mattress was extremely firm. After the first hour I put the spare blanket under the fitted sheet to add a bit of cushion, which helped but didn’t solve it. I woke up stiff and ended up stretching on the floor before breakfast. If you need a soft sleep surface, bring a topper or plan for that.",
        "source_3": "I picked this hotel purely for proximity to the market. It’s literally next door—30 seconds from the lobby to the produce stalls and food counters. The exchange kiosk in the market changed cash with no fee, and I ate breakfast for pocket change each day before heading out. For quick errands and a cheap lunch, the location saved me time and transit fares.",
        "source_4": "About the view: my room on the 3rd floor faced a brick wall and some rooftop vents. Even standing by the window, there was nothing to look at beyond an alley and HVAC units. If you’re expecting skyline or river scenery from the room, it’s not that kind of setup.",
        "source_5": "Two-night business stopover. I reached the lobby around 6 pm and waited about 12 minutes while the single front-desk agent checked in a family and answered a call. The room was tidy but the bed felt unyielding, and there was no topper available when I asked. Being beside the market helped for grabbing food, but deliveries started early and I was already awake from the stiffness anyway. Next time I’ll choose a place where I can count on better rest, even if it means a longer walk."
