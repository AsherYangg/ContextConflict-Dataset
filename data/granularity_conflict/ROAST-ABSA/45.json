        "source_1": "I use these on long tempo runs and the citrus one goes down without any drama. I knead the packet for a few seconds, tear the notch with my teeth, and the gel comes out the texture of thin honey, not paste. If I keep them in the fridge beforehand, they stay smooth and I don’t need a chaser. No throat burn, no clumping, and the spout is easy to aim while moving.",
        "source_2": "I bought a whole case for a hiking trip and struggled after the first two packets. The gel sat in my mouth like hair product, and even with big gulps of water it clung to my tongue and the back of my throat. My partner wouldn’t touch the rest, and I ended up handing most of the box to friends at the gym. I wish I had tried a single before committing to a case.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on performance, two packets during a 50-mile ride kept my energy steady without stomach drama. The sweetness is straightforward and the texture is fluid enough to swallow one-handed on the bike, which is safer for me than chewing. I time one at mile 20 and another around mile 38, and I don’t get that shaky lull I used to have. It’s not a dessert; it’s fuel, and it behaves like it.",
        "source_4": "On taste and mouthfeel alone: the vanilla is mild and reminds me of melted pudding, and it thins out nicely if the packet is warm from a jersey pocket. I usually take a small sip of water after, but it’s not essential for me. If texture bothers you, chilling makes it firmer and more cohesive so it slides down in one squeeze. I’ve never had it glob up or stick in my throat.",
        "source_5": "From an overall standpoint, the case worked for my training block because the packets are clean to open and don’t leak in my bag. The tear seam is consistent, and I can stash three in a waistband without mess. Buying in bulk dropped the per-packet cost, and rotating between mocha and strawberry kept me from getting flavor fatigue. I’d keep a box around for race week just for the convenience."
