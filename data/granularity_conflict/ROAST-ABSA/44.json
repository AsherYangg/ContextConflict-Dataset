        "source_1": "I’ve used the phone for three weeks as my daily driver with two SIMs and about 120 apps installed. Day-to-day stuff feels snappy—Slack, Gmail, Maps, Spotify, and Chrome all stay in memory when I jump between them, and PUBG runs smoothly at higher settings. Battery comfortably gets me through a workday with around 6–7 hours of screen-on time, and a top-up from 20% to 80% takes roughly 40–45 minutes. The phone barely warms up during 30‑minute video calls or while fast charging. Rear photos in daylight look clean enough for social posts, and the front camera is fine for selfies and video meetings.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the battery here: with 120 Hz on and two SIMs, I lose about 10–12% just sitting overnight, and I average 3.5–4 hours of screen-on time before needing a charger. Even after disabling background sync for most apps and switching to adaptive refresh, the drain while idle is still noticeable. The phone warms up near the camera module when fast charging, and a full charge to 100% takes around 1 hour 40 minutes. I now carry a power bank for afternoon meetings because the percentage drops fast during maps navigation and camera use.",
        "source_3": "My use case is all about the front camera—video calls and short-form clips. In daylight, 1080p footage looks crisp with decent stabilization, and auto‑HDR keeps my face from blowing out against bright windows. Skin tones look natural, and portrait selfies do a surprisingly good job with hair edges; it actually outdoes my old Galaxy A50 for selfies. Under dim bar lighting there’s some grain and smoothing, but for Instagram and Zoom it’s more than fine.",
        "source_4": "I bought the 8 GB RAM version for multitasking and gaming, and I’m seeing frequent reloads after a week. Chrome tabs refresh when I jump to WhatsApp and back, the launcher sometimes redraws, and opening the camera during a call makes the UI hitch. Genshin Impact dips into the low 20s after 10–15 minutes, and the phone warms up enough that the frame rate feels inconsistent. I even tried a factory reset and limiting background processes; the system still kills Spotify or Telegram when I switch to maps.",
        "source_5": "Rear camera only: outdoors at noon, shots are sharp with decent dynamic range, though bright skies can look a bit crunchy. Indoors under warm bulbs, fine details like fabric patterns get smudgy unless I hold very still. Night mode helps with exposure but introduces a soft, waxy texture, and the focus can hunt on moving subjects like kids or pets. Video at 4K looks okay as long as I keep my hands steady, but stabilization is clearly better at 1080p.",
        "source_6": "After two months, I’m not thrilled with the overall experience. The phone heats up while charging and during simple navigation, and the battery drops quickly enough that I need a late‑afternoon top‑up. Compared to my four‑year‑old Samsung with 4 GB RAM, this one struggles to keep 4–5 apps alive; Gmail and Calendar often reload when I switch back. Selfies come out soft indoors, the rear camera is fine only in bright light, and yet benchmarks and games are the one area that consistently deliver. If I had to choose again, I’d pick something else."
