        "source_1": "I enrolled to work on speaking technique, and I’m commenting mainly on the instructor. Across the four weeks, he keeps a steady pace—most clips run 10–12 minutes—with on-camera demonstrations of breathing and articulation. Several modules rely on reading bullet points verbatim, so I ended up replaying sections. Live Q&A is scheduled in a different time zone, so I couldn’t attend; forum replies tend to be brief. I follow the unscripted demos; the slide-heavy segments often require replays.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting only on structure. Week 1 introduces posture and breath, then Week 2 jumps to storytelling frameworks without finishing vocal projection. The workbook (pages 12–17) references “Module 3 drills” before Module 3 appears, and the quizzes mix terms (“resonance,” “timbre”) that aren’t defined until later. I repeatedly paused to check the glossary and had to build my own outline to keep topics in order.",
        "source_3": "I took this to tune up my classroom delivery. On day one, I tried the 5‑minute warm‑up and the “hook–story–ask” outline from Module 2. My lecture ran on time, I kept eye contact using the 3‑beat scan, and the recording shows fewer filler words. Over the month, I used the peer feedback rubric with my students; their presentations got more focused, and I borrowed the cadence drill for morning sessions. I could implement the material without rearranging my syllabus.",
        "source_4": "I work in a community health clinic, and most scenarios in the lessons revolve around sales pitches and boardroom updates. The assignment asks you to pitch a product and use an ROI angle; I swapped in a vaccination drive, but the template keeps steering toward quarterly metrics. The case studies feature English‑speaking office settings; there’s little on multilingual audiences or outdoor events. If your context isn’t corporate, expect to translate the examples into your own world.",
        "source_5": "I finished all four weeks and completed every quiz and peer‑graded assignment. The videos are polished, but a lot of time goes to basics I’ve already seen—pause length, posture, filler words—with little on handling hostile audiences or panel formats. Peer reviews were uneven; one assignment got “nice job” with no notes, another was marked down over microphone hiss. The transcript occasionally mislabels terms, and the certificate didn’t count toward my workplace training requirements. After a few team meetings, my delivery felt about the same as before."
