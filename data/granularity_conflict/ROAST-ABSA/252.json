        "source_1": "I focused mainly on endurance because I’m on the road all day. With the 5000 mAh pack, I charge to 100% at 7 a.m., run Google Maps navigation for about 90 minutes, stream Spotify over Bluetooth for 3 hours, take a few photos, and answer Slack on LTE. By 10 p.m. I’m usually at 30–35%. Standby drain overnight is around 2–3%. AccuBattery estimates the capacity at ~4800–4900 mAh after two weeks, and the latest OTA seemed to shave a couple of percentage points off idle drain.",
        "source_2": "Using two SIMs (Airtel and Jio) in Delhi NCR, connectivity has been steady. The phone locks 4G+ indoors, and Speedtest sits around 65–80 Mbps down, 12–18 up on my balcony. Wi‑Fi 5 GHz holds through two walls; I can walk from my study to the kitchen without the video call freezing. I also used it as a hotspot for a two‑hour Teams meeting on my laptop, and the link didn’t drop once.",
        "source_3": "Calls have been tricky on my unit because of the microphone. Multiple people ask me to repeat myself, and voice notes sound muffled as if I’m speaking through fabric. I tested by recording in the stock Voice Recorder app while covering and uncovering the mic holes; tapping near the bottom barely registers. Removing the case and peeling off the factory film didn’t change it. On Bluetooth in my car, folks hear me fine, so the issue seems to be the phone’s primary mic.",
        "source_4": "After ten days of daily use, the device hasn’t held up for me overall. Battery falls from 100% at 8 a.m. to around 40% by 2 p.m. with light use (email, a few photos, podcasts), and I need a top‑up to get through the evening. In my office basement, it often drops LTE and takes a minute to reconnect once I come back upstairs, and calls sometimes arrive straight to voicemail. Several recordings also have a faint hiss, and callers say my voice fades in and out. I performed two factory resets and tested with and without a case; no change, so I scheduled a return.",
        "source_5": "One month in, I’m using this as my primary phone and it covers my day-to-day needs without fuss. Dual‑SIM roaming worked on a weeklong trip (Bengaluru to Pune); maps, ride-hailing, and calls all went through. I get about 6–7 hours of screen‑on time, charge from 15% to full in roughly 80–85 minutes with the bundled 33 W brick, and the device stays cool during long video calls. The mic picks up clearly on Meet and WhatsApp, and I haven’t noticed dropped connections at home on 5 GHz Wi‑Fi."
