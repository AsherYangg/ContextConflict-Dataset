        "source_1": "I’m weighing in on just the aftertaste, since that’s what matters most to me. Brewing with filtered water at around 200°F for 3 minutes gives me a faint metallic, almost licorice-like finish that hangs around for a couple of minutes. At 5 minutes it becomes more noticeable. A squeeze of lemon tames it, but one packet of Splenda seems to bring the finish forward. I tried a splash of 2% milk and the flavor thinned out without removing that lingering note. Compared with my usual afternoon tea, where the taste clears cleanly, this one leaves a trace.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on strength and body: even with two bags in a 12‑ounce mug, the liquor stays pale and the flavor feels thin. With one bag at 4 minutes, it’s delicate to the point that milk turns it into lightly tinted water. I pushed the steep to 7–8 minutes to coax more heft, but then I start to pick up a bitter edge. For a straightforward cup without add‑ins, I can’t seem to find a middle ground between too light and over‑extracted.",
        "source_3": "Overall experience after a month: I switched my mid‑morning coffee to this and it’s been an easy change. Steeping one bag for 4 minutes gives a clean cup that I can sip plain, or with a single packet of Splenda if I’m craving a sweeter sip. I skip milk because it softens the flavor too much for me. No lingering taste after I finish the mug, which I appreciate at work. I’ve brought a few sachets to the office and a couple of coworkers asked for the brand, so I’ve been pointing people to it when they want something gentler than coffee.",
        "source_4": "Full review from the perspective of a coffee substitute and the weight angle: I went through two boxes over three weeks, replacing my afternoon latte with a mug of this. It didn’t really take the edge off my coffee cravings, and I didn’t see any change on the scale or appetite. Flavor-wise, I had to double-bag to get the kind of presence I’m used to, and as the cup cooled I noticed a papery finish. A teaspoon of honey or a packet of sweetener helped, but then it drifted into dessert territory, which defeats the point for me as a daily swap.",
        "source_5": "I’ll stick to the recommendation aspect. I handed out four sachets—two to my neighbor and two to a coworker—before deciding whether to share the rest of the box. Both told me it brewed on the faint side, and my neighbor mentioned a slight aftertaste even without sweetener. After trying it side by side with another brand at the same steep time, I chose not to pass more around in our office snack drawer, since a few of us prefer a stronger cup without any lingering finish."
