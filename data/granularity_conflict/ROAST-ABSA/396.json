        "source_1": "I care a lot about screens, so I’ll focus only on the display. After three months, the panel still looks crisp and even, with no lines or tinting. I keep it at 120 Hz and Natural color profile, and HDR streams on Netflix pop without blowing out skin tones. Outdoors at noon, auto-brightness is strong enough that I can read maps without squinting. I’ve checked for uniformity on a gray test image and don’t see any patches or flicker. I use a tempered glass protector and carry it in a fabric-lined case, and I haven’t noticed any touch latency or ghost touches either.",
        "source_2": "My issue is specifically with the display. Around week six, a thin purple line appeared from the top edge to the bottom after an over-the-air update. Rebooting and Safe Mode didn’t change it, and the line showed up in screenshots as a blank section, which made me think it was hardware. The service center kept the phone for two days and replaced the panel under warranty; they wrote “vertical line—panel swap” on the ticket. I never dropped the phone or got it wet, so the failure was a surprise. It’s working now, but I’m cautious every time a software update pops up.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the phone as a whole, it’s been a reliable daily driver for me. Calls are clear and I get solid signal in my basement office, where my old device struggled. Battery takes me from 7 a.m. to midnight with around 6–7 hours of screen time, mostly Slack, Chrome, and YouTube, and it tops up to 80% in about 35 minutes on the bundled charger. The cameras lock focus fast, and night shots of my dog don’t smear as much as my previous phone. I game on medium settings in Genshin for half an hour during lunch without throttling or frame dips. I haven’t seen any odd lines or color bands on the screen, and the only quirk is the bezel looks a bit thicker than the renders.",
        "source_4": "Judging the whole experience, the device has felt like a time sink. After two months, the screen started showing rainbow bands and occasional freezing, which forced me to visit the service center. First they reflashed the software and sent me home, but the issue returned the next evening while scrolling Instagram. I went back and they replaced the display, and between backups, restores, and re-authenticating apps, I lost most of a weekend. A week later I noticed a faint yellow patch near the bottom edge on a white background, which I can’t unsee when reading ebooks at night. The rest of the phone is fine, but I don’t want to keep making trips for a device I rely on for work.",
        "source_5": "I ran into the “colorful lines” thing once right after updating to build 14.0.3, but it lasted only a few minutes after the first reboot. I wiped cache in recovery and changed the refresh rate from adaptive to 60 Hz, then back, and the artifacting hasn’t returned in two weeks. A support chat agent suggested it might be a display driver hiccup rather than a damaged panel, and they didn’t ask me to come in. Since then, the phone has handled Maps navigation, Bluetooth audio in my car, and two-hour Zoom calls without a glitch. If the lines had persisted I would have gone to the service center, but in my case the software tweak seemed to do the trick."
