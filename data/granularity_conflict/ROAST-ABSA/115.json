        "source_1": "I spent a long weekend at Affinia 50. Checked in at 10:30 a.m. after an overnight flight and the desk had a room ready. Corner room on the 14th floor faced 3rd Ave; double-paned windows kept most traffic noise down, AC held a steady temperature, shower pressure was consistent, and sheets were crisp. I used the small kitchenette for breakfast, grabbed coffee in the lobby each morning, and handled checkout by text with the receipt in my inbox before I reached the elevator.",
        "source_2": "Check-in at Affinia 50 around 11:15 p.m. was bumpy. The line reached the door with only one agent working, and the system froze twice while they tried to pull up reservations. My prepaid booking didn’t appear at first; I was asked to wait off to the side and consider swiping my card again. I showed the confirmation email and bank charge, and I finally had keys at 12:05 a.m. No info was offered about Wi‑Fi or the destination fee, and I had to ask where the elevators were.",
        "source_3": "This is only about the bell staff at Affinia 50. Luis tagged our bags at 8:00 a.m., stored them while we visited MoMA, and by 2:50 p.m. he already had a cart ready when we returned. When rain started, he handed us two umbrellas without being asked. For a 5:00 a.m. airport run, the doorman had a cab at the curb in under two minutes and lifted a heavy ski bag with care, then handed me a luggage-hold ticket for my records.",
        "source_4": "Week-long work trip. The room felt tight with two carry-ons and a garment bag; street noise seeped in most nights even on the 10th floor; morning elevator waits stretched to 6–8 minutes. A daily destination fee covered Wi‑Fi and coffee I didn’t use, and housekeeping missed my room on Tuesday so I called down for towels. The front desk sent up a toothbrush quickly and noted a late checkout, but the overall stay ran more hectic than I expected.",
        "source_5": "I stopped by the front desk to figure out how to reach a Queens restaurant by taxi. The clerk pulled up a map, wrote the cross streets on a Post‑it, and printed a step-by-step subway route as a backup. Outside, the doorman repeated the address to the driver and said, “take the 59th Street Bridge, stay right for Northern Blvd.” We arrived without a detour, and I kept the printout for the return trip."
