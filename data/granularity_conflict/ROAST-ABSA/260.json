        "source_1": "I’ve seen a lot of people mention slow charging, but my unit has been the opposite. With the bundled turbo charger, it goes from around 15% to 80% in roughly 35 minutes, and a full top-up to 100% takes just about an hour. I even timed a few sessions on a Saturday morning while browsing Reddit and streaming music, and the pace didn’t really drop. The phone gets slightly warm near the camera bump during the last 10%, but not to the point where I notice it unless I’m paying attention.",
        "source_2": "Calls have been a headache for me. I’m in downtown Chicago with full bars, yet twice this week my wife said her calls went straight to voicemail while my phone sat on my desk. I swapped SIMs, reset network settings, and tried both Wi‑Fi calling on and off. Speed tests show strong data, but actual voice calls sometimes drop after 20–30 seconds. I missed a client check-in on Tuesday because it never rang, only a voicemail ping after the fact.",
        "source_3": "After two weeks, I’m pretty happy overall. No issues with overheating in day-to-day use—email, Slack, maps, and a bit of YouTube. The camera delivers crisp daylight shots of my kids at the park, and the evening portrait mode looks fine for social media. Charging from 22% to about 80% over lunch takes half an hour with the included brick. The speakers are loud enough for podcasts while cooking, and the price felt reasonable once my trade‑in credit applied.",
        "source_4": "The camera is where it lost me. Indoor photos under warm kitchen lights look soft and smeary, and quick snaps of my toddler come out with motion blur more often than I’d like. Low-light shots are grainy with a waxy skin texture, and video at 4K has shaky corners when I’m walking. I compared the same scenes to my old Samsung from 2019, and the older phone handled faces and dynamic range better in dim rooms.",
        "source_5": "I’ve had a solid audio experience. Paired to my Soundcore earbuds (AAC) and my Honda’s Bluetooth, the connection holds steady with no stutter on my commute. The built‑in speakers have clear vocals for audiobooks; I usually keep volume at 45–50% while washing dishes and can hear every word over the faucet. I recorded a 45‑minute lecture in a medium classroom, and playback sounded clean enough to catch the questions from the back row.",
        "source_6": "Using it as my main phone for a month, the issues stacked up. Topping off from 10% to full consistently takes close to two hours even with the turbo charger, and the back gets toasty during a 20‑minute YouTube session. The mic picks up a hollow tone on voice notes, the speakers distort at higher volumes, and indoor camera shots look flat with muted colors. I’ve also had multiple calls drop despite seeing five bars at home. For what I paid, I expected fewer compromises and ended up moving back to a Samsung."
