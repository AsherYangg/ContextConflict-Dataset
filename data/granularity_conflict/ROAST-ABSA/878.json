        "source_1": "I finished the 6-week course last month. The pacing fit my evening study schedule, and the instructor walked through chord functions over short breakdown clips. In weeks 2, 3, and 5, there were two focused analysis videos (10–12 minutes each) that tied the lectures to real scores. I downloaded the MusicXML files, opened them in MuseScore 4, and could instantly switch to Bb trumpet without retyping. The quizzes lined up with the examples, and the forum replies arrived within a day.",
        "source_2": "I signed up specifically for the analysis walk-throughs. Across weeks 1–5 I kept looking for them and only found a single breakdown tucked into the final module. Most videos were slide presentations with talking, not on-screen score annotation. I need to see the harmonic steps and voice-leading applied, so I ended up pausing the lectures every few seconds and making my own bar-by-bar notes. It felt like the bulk of the analysis I wanted was missing until the end.",
        "source_3": "My feedback is purely about the file formats. The course provided downloadable parts as MusicXML and MuseScore packages, and that made life easy. I dragged the files into MuseScore 4 on my MacBook, hit transpose to Eb alto sax, and printed clean parts for rehearsal. Chord symbols, slurs, and bar numbers came through intact, and I didn't have to spend an evening re-encoding anything.",
        "source_4": "Sticking to file formats only: everything I saw was a flat PDF. I play Bb clarinet, so importing those into MuseScore wasn't viable; the converter mangled ties and accidentals. I had to enter each measure manually, re-add dynamics, and then transpose, which ate up two weeknights. Even the “worksheet” parts lacked measure numbers, so cross-referencing with the video timestamps was awkward.",
        "source_5": "As a hobbyist pianist, I took the course start to finish and paid attention to how the materials supported practice. The assignments had me notating motifs and labeling cadences, but most weeks leaned on long lectures with slides rather than hands-on breakdowns. The single analysis video in the last week finally showed the step-by-step application I expected earlier. Since the scores were not in an editable format on my end, I resorted to scanning pages and rebuilding sections in MuseScore to play along. Peer reviews addressed measure-level details.",
        "source_6": "I dipped in and out over four weeks, watching on my phone during commutes. The short analysis clips were sprinkled throughout—one on rhythmic reduction in week 1, another on chromatic mediants in week 3—and they tied neatly to the reading. The downloadable MusicXML opened fine in Dorico and MuseScore, so I could transpose for F horn with a click. Quizzes mirrored the examples, and the capstone project stitched the topics together."
