        "source_1": "I worked through the entire sequence over two weekends, and the flow made sense from week to week. The lectures on logistic regression and decision boundaries matched the labs: the notebook had cells that walked me through feature scaling, then plotting decision regions, in the same order as the video. Quizzes checked the same formulas and terms covered in the slides, so there were no surprises. Even the deep learning mini‑project included brief notes inside the notebook cells that nudged me toward the right steps, which kept me moving.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on one assignment: the deep learning module asked where “simple classification” is applicable, giving a list of functions to choose from. I couldn’t tie that question back to anything in the lectures, because there was no worked example showing how to decide between those options. The notebook didn’t demonstrate a method to discover the answer, and the auto‑grader just returned “incorrect” without explaining what criteria it expected. I checked the forum and found multiple interpretations, so I ended up guessing rather than following a taught process.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I enrolled to get a big‑picture orientation to ML, and the breakdown of topics like bias/variance and regularization was approachable. The examples—housing price prediction one week, a simple binary classification the next—helped me understand what the algorithms do. The deep learning homework, though, referenced activation choices and cross‑entropy without prior hands‑on practice, so I had to consult external blogs to figure out the steps it wanted. Aside from that week, the rest of the course felt coherent.",
        "source_4": "Zooming in on clarity only: I watched the segments on classification vs. regression, confusion matrices, and ROC curves, and the instructor used small datasets and diagrams that made the mechanics clear. The notebook’s cells were arranged so each concept (thresholds, false positives, precision/recall) had a tiny experiment right below the explanation, which made it easy to follow along. I didn’t attempt the graded tasks; I was focused on understanding the terminology and how the pieces fit together.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on assignments: I found the graded work tied closely to the lectures, especially in the classification week. The quiz mirrored the spam‑filter example from the video, and the notebook pointed back to the same feature engineering steps shown on screen. In the deep learning module, the prompt about where simple classification applies made sense once I mapped the lecture’s scenarios (text tags, image labels) to the function list, and the rubric seemed to expect that kind of matching. I got through without needing extra materials.",
        "source_6": "From an overall perspective, I completed all lectures and labs but hit a wall on two assignments that referred to material I hadn’t seen demonstrated. The deep learning module’s question about applicability offered a list of functions with names that hadn’t been introduced in practice, and there was no method shown for narrowing them down. I spent a couple of evenings trying to reverse‑engineer what the auto‑grader wanted from the rubric and discussion threads, and still couldn’t derive a consistent approach. The videos were watchable, but I couldn’t finish the certificate because those tasks didn’t connect back to the taught steps."
