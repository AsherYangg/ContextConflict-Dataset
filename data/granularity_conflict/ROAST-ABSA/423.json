        "source_1": "I stayed one night before a 7 a.m. flight and found the Sheraton at Schiphol easy to slot into a tight schedule. From Schiphol Plaza it was a covered walk of about five minutes; I was in room 624 by 9:10 p.m. The runway view looked dramatic but the windows kept things quiet enough for an early sleep. Frank in the restaurant steered me to the faster items at breakfast right at 6:00 so I could catch the 6:32 train to Zuid, and Daniel grabbed a cart and helped me get my oddly shaped sample cases back to the walkway. Blackout curtains, a firm mattress, decent water pressure, and USB ports by the bed made the short stay hassle-free.",
        "source_2": "I booked this place because everyone says it’s “at the airport,” but getting there with a stroller and two suitcases after landing at F7 at 11:45 p.m. was more of a trek than I expected. The signage to the hotel disappears once you hit the plaza; I took one elevator up, another down, and a corridor was blocked for maintenance so I had to backtrack. It took me about 20 minutes from gate to reception, and in the morning the path to the trains had me weaving around closed shops and construction partitions. If you’re arriving late or from a far pier, build in extra time.",
        "source_3": "My room (336) never cooled properly. The thermostat let me set 19°C, but the airflow felt warm and the temperature hovered around 23° all night. The window doesn’t open, the duvet was heavy for August, and the pillows flattened into nothing by 2 a.m. There was an intermittent hum from the ceiling that kicked on and off, and the shower drain pooled around my feet for a few minutes before clearing. The desk chair also wobbled, which made catching up on emails awkward.",
        "source_4": "I want to call out the staff specifically. Frank at the restaurant greeted me by name on my second morning and had a cappuccino on the way before I even sat down. He pointed me to the quick items so I could make the 7:02 train to Centraal. Daniel from bell service met me by the lifts with a trolley right after I called down, and he walked me to the correct corridor for the covered walkway so I didn’t get caught in the crowd by the plaza. An adapter and extra towels arrived within minutes of asking.",
        "source_5": "For an overnight before a flight, the location works, but the experience had snags. I arrived at 6:05 p.m. and the check-in line wrapped through the lobby; with only two desks open, it took 28 minutes to get a key. Trays with half-finished dinners sat in the hallway by 8:30 and were still there when I went down for ice after 10. The bar was packed with crews, so I ended up ordering room service; the burger came lukewarm after 55 minutes. The mattress was fine, yet the bedside outlets were loose enough that my phone cable slipped out twice overnight.",
        "source_6": "I’m focusing on service moments. At the restaurant around 9:15 p.m., I sat for ten minutes before anyone brought a menu; when I waved someone down, he mentioned the kitchen would stop in fifteen and suggested I grab something in the plaza instead. The next morning, with two ski bags and a carry-on, I went to the bell stand at 6:00 a.m. and no one was there; after waiting five minutes I hauled everything through the walkway myself."
