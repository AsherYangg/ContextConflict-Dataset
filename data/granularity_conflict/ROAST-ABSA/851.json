        "source_1": "I came to Manhattan for a long weekend and chose this hotel because the map pin looked perfect. In reality, the closest subway entrance was fenced off for construction, so every trip meant a detour of two long avenues. With a carry-on and a stroller, that detour felt endless, especially in the rain. The walk to Times Square took us nearly 20 minutes through thick crowds, and getting to the Museum of Natural History required a transfer that turned a simple ride into a 40-minute slog. Nights were lively—there’s a music venue opposite that keeps the street buzzing well past midnight—so it wasn’t the quiet base we hoped for. Even breakfast options nearby were either packed or pricey; after two tries, we gave up and ate in the lobby café just to avoid hunting around.",
        "source_2": "I’m 6'2\", and the king mattress in room 1807 sank in the middle like a hammock. By morning, my lower back was complaining and my feet were hanging off the edge because the bed felt short once the pillows were stacked. The four pillows looked plush but were oddly lumpy, and the one soft option flattened to a pancake in minutes. Every time I rolled over, the bedframe let out a creak that my partner could hear over the air conditioner. The sheets were pristine but had that slightly scratchy feel you get when they’re laundered with heavy-duty bleach. If you’re sensitive to mattress firmness or pillow support, it’s worth asking what they can provide before you settle in.",
        "source_3": "From the moment we walked in, the stay felt easy. The front desk held our bags, then surprised us with a corner room on a high floor when we came back later. My teenager basically camped out in the shower—big rainfall head, full pressure, and no temperature swings. Our younger kid went wild when the turndown team left chocolates and a tiny plush on the pillow; they even folded his blanket into a superhero cape. The bed was one of those you sink into after a long day, and we woke up to a sweeping view over the Hudson and a slice of the skyline. Getting around was straightforward: two blocks to the subway and a quick walk to the theater district. It was the kind of stay where you don’t feel like you’re constantly troubleshooting.",
        "source_4": "I don’t usually get excited about hotel bathrooms, but the shower setup in 2615 was the highlight of my trip. There’s a wide rainfall head and a handheld wand, and the water pressure stayed strong even at 8 a.m. when everyone’s getting ready. No sudden blasts of cold when someone flushed, and the temperature responded immediately to small adjustments. The floor had good grip and a built-in bench, which made it easy to rinse off after a long run in Central Park. Towels were oversized and actually absorbent, and the bath products had a subtle scent that didn’t linger all day. If you value a reliable, roomy shower to start your morning, this one delivered.",
        "source_5": "We did a four-night stay, and a lot of little things added up. Check-in turned into a half-hour queue because only two stations were open, and nobody seemed eager to move the line along. Our “city view” room faced a brick wall ten feet away; when we asked to switch, the next room looked into a tangle of rooftop HVAC units. The nightly turndown happened once out of four nights, and that was only after we called down. Elevators were slow at peak times, with waits pushing five minutes in the morning. The location meant weaving through heavy traffic to get anywhere, and by the time we reached the subway, trains were jammed enough that we let two go by. The bed itself was fine, but the shower lost pressure around 7:30 a.m., which made getting three people out the door a chore.",
        "source_6": "I paid extra for a “skyline” upgrade and took room 1512, expecting the kind of panorama you see in the brochure. The window looked north toward another tower that swallowed most of the sightline, so the only slice of skyline was a narrow gap over some rooftop vents. Daytime was dull; nighttime came with glare from a neighboring billboard that turned the room into a dimly lit box. I tried switching to a higher floor, but the scaffolding on the adjacent building still cut across the view like a grid. If your main reason for booking is to stare out at Manhattan between meetings, ask for the exact orientation—otherwise you may be paying for a view you can’t really enjoy."
