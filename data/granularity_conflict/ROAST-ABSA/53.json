        "source_1": "I picked these up for backpacking soups and found the pieces larger than I expected—closer to fingernail-sized chunks. Even after a 20–25 minute simmer, several stayed leathery, and in a pot of minestrone they chewed like fruit leather; I ended up pulling the pot off the heat and snipping the pieces smaller with kitchen scissors to make them workable.",
        "source_2": "My take is strictly on size: the dice hits a sweet spot for me. The bits are small enough to scatter evenly through a skillet of onions and garlic, but still big enough to notice in a bite of pasta; no sheet-like strips or crumbs, and I don’t have to drag out a knife to chop them down.",
        "source_3": "As a solo cook, I kept tossing half-used fresh tomatoes, but this bag finally stopped that waste. I keep it in the pantry and shake a teaspoon straight into weeknight sauces, omelets, and couscous; no oil to drain, no mess, and I can measure exactly what I need. A month in, the pouch still smells like a farmers’ market stall, and a small pinch wakes up a jarred marinara without crowding the pan.",
        "source_4": "My overall experience wasn’t great: the first scoop released a puff of tomato dust, and the bottom third of the bag was mostly fines and seeds with a few hard, dark flecks mixed in. I soaked a cup for 30 minutes and the liquid turned tea-brown; the pieces tasted oddly bitter and made a vodka sauce taste flat, so I fished out the specks and ended up adding tomato paste and sugar just to get dinner on the table.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on convenience only: the zipper track on my pouch separated after a few openings, so moisture crept in and the contents clumped into sticky clusters. I had to transfer everything to a mason jar with a desiccant pack, and every scoop still kicks up a light dust that coats my counter and cutting board."
