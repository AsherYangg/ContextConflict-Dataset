        "source_1": "On my second week, the on‑screen keyboard started acting up. In WhatsApp and Chrome, I’d tap the text box and nothing shows. I see the cursor blinking but no keypad. If I swipe up to recent apps and close the app, then reopen, the keyboard appears and I can type. It happens mostly after switching quickly between messaging and the gallery, or when the phone has been on for a full day without a reboot. I tried swapping from Gboard to the stock keyboard and clearing caches, but the behavior looks the same. It’s random—some mornings it’s fine, then mid‑afternoon it’ll refuse to pop up until I force close the app.",
        "source_2": "Calls have been odd. Three times this month, I placed an outgoing call and the dialer showed it connecting, but there was complete silence on both ends. The timer ran, yet the other person later said they never heard me. On two other occasions, tapping the call button did nothing for a good 10 seconds, then the screen flashed “calling” and dropped back to the contact list. Toggling airplane mode or switching mobile data off and on brings it back. I’m on the same SIM I used in my older phone, same network, same location, so it’s not coverage. VoLTE is toggled on, and Wi‑Fi calling doesn’t change it.",
        "source_3": "Attaching files in email is hit or miss for me. In Gmail, I hit the paperclip, browse to Downloads, pick a 1.2 MB PDF, and the spinner just keeps spinning with no thumbnail. After I force close Gmail and reopen, the same file attaches instantly. This happened with two invoices and one PNG from the screenshot folder. If I share from the file manager into Gmail, it sometimes goes through, but picking the file from inside Gmail is the troublesome path. I counted five attempts one night before it finally stuck.",
        "source_4": "Using the phone as my main device for work travel, I haven’t run into the keyboard or calling quirks people mention. The keypad pops up right away in Slack, Outlook, and the browser, even after long days of switching apps. I place multiple calls daily and they connect immediately with clear audio, including over Wi‑Fi calling in hotels. Sending attachments is routine: PDFs and photos show thumbnails and send from Gmail without me having to close or reopen anything. I reboot the phone maybe once a week, mostly after updates, and haven’t had to do app gymnastics to get basic tasks done.",
        "source_5": "Overall, the phone gets me through my routine, but the software feels twitchy under pressure. After about two hours of heavy multitasking—Spotify, Maps, and jumping between two chat apps—the UI will freeze for five to ten seconds, taps don’t register, and then it recovers. The mail app sometimes refuses to attach a file until I close it and start fresh, and the dialer has twice showed a call active with no sound until I hang up and redial. None of this happens every day, yet it’s noticeable enough that I keep a habit of restarting the problematic app when it stalls."
