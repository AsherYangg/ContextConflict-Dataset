        "source_1": "I bought this as a daily driver for commuting, and the battery has been the sticking point. With two SIMs active, 4G on, and a smartwatch connected, I leave home at 7 a.m. with 100% and by around 3–4 p.m. I’m limping along at 15–20%. I average about 3.5–4 hours of screen-on time (mostly maps, WhatsApp, and YouTube). Overnight, it drops roughly 8–10% even when I close background apps. The inbox charger takes a little over two hours to go from 15% to full, so I end up topping up at lunch and again before heading home.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about displays because I read long articles and ebooks. The screen here is fine indoors if I keep brightness above 70%, but small text looks a bit fuzzy and I can see jagged edges on icons. Colors feel muted—grass in cricket highlights lacks that pop—and viewing angles are narrow enough that tilting the phone makes whites shift slightly. Outdoors at noon, I have to cup my hand over the top to read a message, and the auto-brightness often reacts a second or two late. For late-night reading in dark mode, it’s usable, but it doesn’t invite binge-watching.",
        "source_3": "Picked this up during a sale for my dad, and for the basics it has been dependable. Calls are clear, the keyboard keeps up with his typing, and WhatsApp photos load without hiccups. Fingerprint unlock works on the first try most of the time, and the device hasn’t frozen or rebooted on us yet. He charges it every night and it gets him through his day of calls, YouTube news clips, and payments. The screen is nothing fancy and the camera is just serviceable, but at this price it covers the essentials without fuss—honestly, a thumbs up under this budget.",
        "source_4": "I needed a spare phone for work trips, and it didn’t quite fit the bill as an all-day companion. Running navigation for client visits plus Spotify in the background drains it noticeably—on one route I watched 30% disappear in about an hour. Midday sunlight made the map harder to read, even at max brightness, and I had to keep a power bank plugged in during rides. It handles emails and calls fine, but between the frequent charging and the screen glare, I ended up carrying my older device as backup, which defeats the point of traveling light.",
        "source_5": "My usage is light—two email accounts, an hour of podcasts, some Instagram scrolling, and a few calls—and the battery holds up surprisingly well. I charge to 100% at night, and by the end of the next day I’m usually around 40%, sometimes stretching to a day and a half before I even think about plugging in. On Wi‑Fi, YouTube sips about 5% per hour, and overnight it loses 2–3%. A quick top-up in the evening gets me through without anxiety, so for my routine it’s been easy to live with."
