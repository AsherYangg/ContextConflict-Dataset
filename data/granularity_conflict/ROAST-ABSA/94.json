        "source_1": "I took this course over four weeks while working full-time, and the structure made it manageable. The sequence of videos, short readings, and practice notebooks felt intentional, and the weekly projects actually built on each other. For example, the Week 2 assignment had me clean a messy CSV and visualize trends; by Week 4 I used the same dataset to build a simple classifier and summarized results in a notebook report. Quizzes matched what was taught instead of trick questions. I finished feeling I could apply the core ideas to a small project at work, and the pacing never felt like filler.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the subtitles. I watch with Spanish captions to keep up on commutes, and several technical terms were off. “Regularization” became “regulación,” and “gradient descent” showed as “descenso de gradiente” in one video and “pendiente gradual” in another. In Week 3, the captions lagged by about two seconds, so I kept rewinding to catch the equations. I submitted two feedback reports with timestamps (e.g., 06:45 and 12:10 in the “Optimization” lecture), but the captions stayed the same for at least a week, which slowed me down a lot.",
        "source_3": "As an overall impression after finishing, the course felt uneven. The first week promised hands-on practice, but many code cells were pre-filled, so I spent more time reading outputs than reasoning through steps. The jump from linear models to neural nets skipped explanations I expected, like why activation choices matter; I had to pause and search external articles. Peer-graded assignments sometimes rewarded formatting over insight—my submission with a deeper error analysis got fewer points than a slick-looking notebook. I completed everything, but I left with gaps I hadn’t planned on filling elsewhere.",
        "source_4": "I’ll comment only on community support. The discussion forum surprised me in a good way: when I posted a question about a broadcasting error in NumPy, a mentor replied within 8 hours with a minimal reproducible example and a link to the exact timestamp where the instructor handled the same edge case. The thread was tagged and moved into a “Common Pitfalls” section, so others could find it. I also appreciated the pinned post that mapped quiz questions to lecture segments with direct links, which made reviewing a specific concept much faster.",
        "source_5": "I’m zeroing in on audio quality. In Week 2 (“Feature Engineering”), the microphone had a constant hiss, and there were clipping spikes around 03:12 and 09:40 when the instructor emphasized key terms. With headphones, the sibilance became tiring after ten minutes, and I had to drop the volume so low that equations on the board were hard to follow without replaying. Week 4 improved a bit, but the volume was inconsistent between segments, so I kept reaching for the volume slider mid-lecture. It didn’t make the content unusable, but it added friction to longer study sessions."
