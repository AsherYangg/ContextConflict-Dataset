        "source_1": "I took the December cohort and wrapped up in three weeks. The lectures build on each other nicely, and the weekly quizzes actually match what’s in the readings. What surprised me most was how straightforward the assignment pages were: each task had a short checklist, screenshots of the submission flow, and a sample file to compare against. I uploaded a PDF and a Jupyter notebook, got peer feedback within 48 hours, and moved on to the capstone without any hiccups. I’ve already shared the course link with two coworkers who are ramping up on the same topic.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing solely on the instructions here. The syllabus banner and the email from the platform both said we could catch up until Dec 21, but the assignment page still showed a hard due date of Dec 14. The video walkthrough says “submit a .docx,” while the written instructions only accept PDF—my .docx was rejected with no explanation. The rubric appeared only after I submitted, and the “Editing” section gives an example that doesn’t match the current interface. I ended up with a “not accepted” message even though I thought I was still in the catch-up window.",
        "source_3": "My issue is only with the submission and editing rules. I turned in the project on time, noticed a typo, and hit Edit to fix it. After saving, the system stamped it with a new timestamp and flagged it as late, then blocked the resubmission entirely. Support told me the course uses the session time zone, not mine (I’m UTC+10), but there’s no clock on the page to warn you. The “not accepted” banner appears only after you try to confirm, so you do all the steps just to be shut out. Content aside, the acceptance logic and the editing lockout are what tripped me up.",
        "source_4": "As a whole, the material is thorough and the examples land well—I could apply the techniques at work the same week. But the process around deadlines and project acceptance colored the experience from start to finish. I read in multiple places that there was time to catch up until late December, so I paced myself accordingly. My capstone was refused, and the edit button vanished after one attempt, even though I was still seeing “flexible schedule” in the progress tab. If a friend asked me where to start, I’d steer them elsewhere unless the policies get clarified.",
        "source_5": "I’m zeroing in on instruction clarity only. Every module begins with a one-paragraph overview, then a step-by-step checklist with tiny green check marks as you complete each step. The “Editing your submission” section shows the exact button labels and even the confirmation dialog you’ll see, with callouts pointing to the parts that change after a deadline. I kept that page open on a second monitor while working and never once had to guess which file format or naming convention to use."
