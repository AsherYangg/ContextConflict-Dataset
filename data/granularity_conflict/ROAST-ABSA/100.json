        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for long days on site, and the battery hasn’t kept up the way I hoped. With mobile data on and about an hour of Maps plus Slack and email, I’m down to 30% by 6 p.m. Screen-on time averages around 3.5–4 hours, and there’s a 10–12% drop overnight even in airplane mode. The 5000 mAh label sounded reassuring, but I still end up topping off during lunch to be safe.",
        "source_2": "My focus is connectivity because I use navigation for deliveries. In town it behaves, but once I head into the outskirts the GPS arrow drifts off the road and takes a few seconds to snap back, which makes it easy to miss turns. Calls to customers cut out on two stretches of rural highway where my older device held the line. Data shows two or three bars yet pages hang; switching to airplane mode and back is the only way to kick it back into gear.",
        "source_3": "I care a lot about audio since I take calls on speaker and watch videos. The bottom speaker gets tinny above 70% volume, and voices sound a bit hollow on conference calls. In the car with Bluetooth (AAC), there’s a noticeable delay on YouTube, so lips don’t match for a second or so. The earpiece is on the quiet side too; in a café I have to cup the phone to hear clearly.",
        "source_4": "I set this up for my dad and he’s been using it daily for Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, video calls, and plenty of regular calls. The battery easily lasts him through two days since he’s mostly on Wi‑Fi at home, and he plugs in every other night. Maps has guided him around unfamiliar parts of town without hiccups, and the signal didn’t waver on a train ride out to our village. Wi‑Fi stays connected in the back room where his old phone used to drop, and the call audio is crisp enough that he stopped using his wired headset.",
        "source_5": "Using this as my work phone, I’ve run into some rough edges even after all updates. On my commute, calls sound choppy when the phone hands off between towers, and twice this week the other person couldn’t hear me until I toggled VoLTE off and on. Wi‑Fi calling in my office is hit-or-miss; messages arrive late unless I switch to mobile data. The battery gets me to evening, but maps occasionally “recalculates” for no reason, which isn’t something I can shrug off during client visits.",
        "source_6": "Just weighing in on battery only: I’m seeing around 1.5–2 days per charge with moderate use (about 2 hours Spotify over Bluetooth, an hour of video, and a couple of short calls). A 30-minute GPS trip plus photos at the park took it from 78% to 62%, which seems reasonable. Overnight drain is roughly 3–4% with Wi‑Fi and notifications on. Charging from 20% to 80% takes a bit under an hour with the included brick."
