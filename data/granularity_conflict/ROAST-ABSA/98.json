        "source_1": "I enrolled for the specialization specifically to get comfortable with the tooling, but the setup took far longer than the lessons suggested. The videos show installing Anaconda and a specific version of Jupyter, but on my M1 Mac the environment wouldn’t resolve packages, and the interface in the video didn’t match the current installer. I spent three evenings combing through forum posts and a GitHub issue before finding a workaround, and two of the cloud labs timed out before the kernels even launched. Once the notebooks finally ran, the first assignment required a library version the grader didn’t accept, so I had to roll back packages just to submit.",
        "source_2": "I completed the entire specialization over eight weeks while working full-time, and the structure made it manageable. The 8–12 minute videos fit into lunch breaks, and the weekly quizzes aligned with what was taught instead of throwing curveballs. By the end, I had a small data pipeline pulling from an API, cleaning with pandas, and presenting a Streamlit dashboard that I deployed on Render. The capstone feedback pointed me to concrete fixes—naming conventions, project README, and reproducible environments—so I left with a portfolio piece I actually show in interviews.",
        "source_3": "My main issue was with peer grading in Course 3. I submitted the project on time and received two scores that differed by more than 40%, with one reviewer marking several rubric items as “not attempted” even though those sections were on page two of the notebook. There were no comments attached, and by the time the third review came in, the resubmission window had closed. Support sent me a canned response pointing me back to the forum, and the teaching staff only checked threads once a week, so the grade never got corrected.",
        "source_4": "Taking the specialization as a whole, the content felt stretched across courses that repeated the same introductions. Each course reopened with the identical “what is data” segment and basic Python syntax, which added hours without much new material. The capstone relied on a small, cleaned sample dataset rather than the messy source data discussed earlier, so the final project didn’t reflect the real-world pipeline the lectures described. Office hours happened in a time zone that made live attendance tough, and the community channel went quiet after the first two weeks, leaving questions hanging.",
        "source_5": "Course 2 was the standout for me because of its hands-on approach to data cleaning. The lab that walks through handling nulls and outliers in the NYC taxi dataset was very step-by-step, and the downloadable checklist for validating joins saved me from introducing duplicate rows. I keep the provided cheat sheet on datetime parsing handy, and the optional segment on writing tests for your transformations pushed me to organize my notebook cells more deliberately.",
        "source_6": "The syntax explanations in Course 1 moved too quickly for beginners. The instructor jumped from list comprehensions to lambda functions and then to NumPy broadcasting with only one fast code demo per topic, and the notebook didn’t annotate what each line actually returns. When an error popped up (like shape mismatches), the video simply reran the cell without showing how to inspect .shape or add print statements to trace the issue. I had to pause every few seconds and piece together the meaning of each parameter from external docs, which slowed me more than the estimated pace."
