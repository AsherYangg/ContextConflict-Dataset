        "source_1": "I bought this because it seemed like a healthier option and ran into the same issue across multiple meals: it just wouldn’t disappear. I stirred a teaspoon into a pot of marinara for 35 minutes and still felt tiny hard bits when we ate. The next day I mixed it into a chicken-and-rice casserole before baking, and there was the same sandy crunch. Whatever is in these crystals doesn’t melt into food the way my usual salt does.",
        "source_2": "My experience with dissolving has been the opposite. I add a palm pinch straight into boiling pasta water and it’s gone by the time the water returns to a rolling boil. In pan sauces and risotto, it blends in within a minute of whisking. Even in a lemon-olive oil vinaigrette, it clears after 20–30 seconds of whisking, and I’m not left with grit on the plate.",
        "source_3": "As an overall pantry staple, this has worked well for me. I keep the crystals in a small grinder set to a fine grind and use it on eggs, roasted vegetables, and steaks. The flavor comes through cleanly without the sharpness I get from iodized table salt, and I need less than I expect. The resealable bag has held up, and there’s been no clumping in my humid kitchen.",
        "source_4": "After a few tries, I stopped using it because meals kept coming out with a gritty texture. It showed up in spaghetti sauce, on buttered corn, and even in a slow-cooked chili that simmered for hours. My family kept asking why dinner felt like it had tiny pebbles in it, and switching back to regular table salt made that problem vanish.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on dissolving: in baking and brining, it behaves just fine for me. I weigh 10 g for sourdough, mix it during autolyse, and by the first fold there are no visible crystals and the loaf tastes evenly seasoned. For quick pickles I make a 3% brine by weight, shake the jar, and the liquid goes clear within a few minutes without sediment. The only time I see leftover crystals is when I sprinkle coarse grains on salad without tossing."
