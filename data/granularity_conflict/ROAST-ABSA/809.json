        "source_1": "I bought the Lickity Stik to use with a rubber Kong, and the dispenser control has been tricky. Even with the tip barely open, the liquid runs fast—one tilt and three licks later there’s a shiny film on the Kong and a small bead forming on the bottle lip. I tried holding it completely upright and rolling the tip against the toy, but the flow doesn’t slow; it’s more like a stream than a dab, so portioning per lick is hard.",
        "source_2": "On scent alone, this thing is strong. I cracked the cap in the kitchen and got a clear bacon whiff from six feet away. My terrier popped up from a nap and started sniffing around the counter before I even touched his tug rope. After a short session, the rope smelled like breakfast for the rest of the afternoon, and his breath carried the same aroma on our walk.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I needed something to occupy my shepherd during video calls. The Lickity Stik buys about 10 minutes of steady licking on a chew toy, which is enough to finish an email, but it doesn’t do much beyond that—he comes away just as keyed up and it doesn’t help with “down” or “stay.” I’ve noticed a light brown tint on his favorite ball after a couple uses, and the bottle will drip if I angle it too far while he’s working. It functions as a quick time-filler, yet I haven’t seen lasting changes in behavior.",
        "source_4": "I focused on staining because we have a white rope bone. I drew two lines of the liquid on the rope and a gray silicone lick mat, let my lab work on them for 15 minutes, then wiped both with a damp cloth. The rope looked the same afterward—no brown cast—and the mat rinsed clean under the tap. I left the rope to dry overnight and checked again in daylight; still no discoloration.",
        "source_5": "I’ve been using it strictly as a training reward, not for free licking. On off-leash hikes, a short swipe across the tip and a sniff gets my husky to break off from chasing birds and return. During obedience drills, I mark a sit with the clicker and give a one-second lick instead of a treat, which keeps his focus without interrupting the flow. I keep the bottle in my jacket pocket; the cap stays put and the roller hasn’t leaked after a month of daily sessions. The smell is faint to me, but he locks onto it instantly, and it’s been enough to hold attention around other dogs."
