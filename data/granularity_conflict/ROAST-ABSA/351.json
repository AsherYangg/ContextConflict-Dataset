        "source_1": "I picked Relais Bosquet for location. From the front door to École Militaire station it took me 3 minutes at a brisk walk; with a suitcase and a stroller it felt closer to 8 because of the stairs. Rue Cler is around the corner, so breakfast baguettes became a daily habit. The flip side: delivery trucks show up by 6:30 a.m., and if your room faces the street you’ll hear crates clacking. For Eiffel Tower access, I was standing on the Champ de Mars in about 12 minutes. After 11 p.m., the taxi rank near the corner thinned out fast.",
        "source_2": "I mostly interacted with Gerard and Frederika at the desk. They mapped out a Louvre route that skipped the worst lines, secured a last‑minute table at Café Constant when my app failed, and printed our Versailles tickets without charge. When my adapter fizzled, Gerard brought up a replacement within five minutes and walked me through resetting the room safe. I didn’t need extra housekeeping services, but they still pinged me on WhatsApp each afternoon to check on towels or pillows.",
        "source_3": "Four nights in a standard double. The room looked tidy at first glance but storage was limited to a narrow wardrobe, and the bed ran firm enough that my hip went numb after a couple of hours. The window opened onto an internal courtyard where bottle bins were emptied before sunrise, so sleep was broken most mornings. The Eiffel Tower was technically visible if I leaned out and looked left; from inside, the angle didn’t clear the neighboring roofline. The air unit kept the temperature tolerable but never cooled the space evenly. Walking to the Metro took me closer to seven minutes because of crosswalks and tour groups along Rue Cler. Desk staff were courteous, yet the stay felt like more effort than I wanted, and I’d try a different place next time.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about cleanliness. In my room the bathroom grout was bright, the shower drain ran clear, and I couldn’t find dust on the headboard or lamps. Housekeeping left vacuum lines on the carpet each day and swapped every glass for a wrapped one. The kettle showed no limescale ring, and the white towels came back bone‑dry with no gray edges. I travel with a UV flashlight; nothing suspicious on linens or curtains.",
        "source_5": "Weekend anniversary trip. Check‑in took two minutes, keys in hand and bags sent up while we signed. Our corner room had a petite balcony; from the chair by the window we watched the Eiffel Tower sparkle without stepping outside. Even with the window ajar at night, the street stayed quiet enough that we slept straight through. Morning croissants on Rue Cler were steps away, and École Militaire made getting to the Marais straightforward. Between the compact but thoughtful storage, a quiet mini‑fridge, and a rain shower with steady pressure, the place matched what we wanted, and I’m already looking at dates to return."
