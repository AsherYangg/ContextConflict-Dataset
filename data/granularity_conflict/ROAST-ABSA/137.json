        "source_1": "I made grilled NY strip steaks last weekend and crumbled a generous tablespoon of Stilton over each during the last minute on the grill. It relaxed into a glossy blanket without breaking, and the tang rounded out the beefiness instead of drowning it. The salt level felt restrained, so I could still taste the char and pepper. For context, my local specialty shop wants about $30 per pound; on Amazon I paid just under $20, and it arrived in a cold pack that kept its shape. This has become my go-to steak topper because it melts predictably and doesn’t turn watery.",
        "source_2": "I bought this cheese solely to test how it melts. I cubed about 2 ounces and put it under the broiler on top of smash burgers; after 90 seconds it sweated oil and left stubborn pebbles that wouldn’t smooth out. Tried again in a small skillet over low heat: the edges softened but it never formed a cohesive sauce, and a slick of fat separated. For a melt test, it behaved more like a crumbly table cheese than something that integrates cleanly.",
        "source_3": "Speaking strictly about saltiness: a small crumble—maybe an ounce—into my pan sauce for a reverse-seared ribeye made the reduction taste briny. I had to double the cream and add a knob of unsalted butter to quiet it down. Even on a baked potato, a few teaspoons pushed the overall dish past what I consider comfortable seasoning.",
        "source_4": "Price-only observation. I paid $22 for an 8 oz wedge on Amazon (before tax). The same producer’s Stilton at my neighborhood market was $18 for the identical weight the following week, and they run periodic 10% cheese discounts. Factoring in a $5 shipping add-on from Amazon, I actually came out higher online, so the in-store option ended up the better deal for me.",
        "source_5": "Texture notes only. At room temperature after 30 minutes on the board, the wedge slumped and became almost spreadable, and when I tried to crumble it over a salad it smeared into clumps. I expected a drier, friable crumble with a bit of crystal, but this batch leaned pasty and borderline runny.",
        "source_6": "Full experience with steak night: I pan-seared two NY strips, then added slices of the cheese while the meat rested. The flavor took over the plate and left a lingering metallic edge, and the topping didn’t melt uniformly—some spots pooled oil while other bits stayed chalky. The wedge arrived cool but not cold, and the paste near the rind seemed softer than the center, which might have affected how it behaved on the hot steak."
