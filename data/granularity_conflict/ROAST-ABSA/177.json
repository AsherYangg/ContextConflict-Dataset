        "source_1": "I’m zeroing in on aroma here: when I cracked the seal at 6 a.m., I expected the kitchen to bloom with that fresh-roast scent, but the bag gave off a faint, papery smell, almost like wet cardboard. The roast date showed it was within two weeks, and I ground 20 g on a Baratza Encore at 15 for a V60 (1:15 ratio, 200°F). Even during the bloom there wasn’t much fragrance rising from the cup. I brewed a second pot side-by-side with my regular beans using the same setup; those perfumed the room, while this one stayed muted.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the finish: the first sip felt fine, but the aftertaste clung as a bitter, ashy film that stuck around through my commute. I tried dialing it in—coarser grind, 195°F water, shorter contact time in a Clever dripper—and the lingering metallic note didn’t budge. Swapping to spring water from filtered tap didn’t change it, and even with a splash of oat milk, that tail-end twang overshadowed everything. My partner took a sip and immediately commented on how it coated the tongue.",
        "source_3": "As a whole experience, this became my weekday go-to after a week of tests. Two cups every morning using a 1:16 ratio on a Bonavita drip (medium grind) give me a steady, balanced mug that doesn’t need anything added. The kitchen smells inviting while it brews, and the cup comes through with a rounded profile that works just as well in a French press on weekends. I’ve run it through an AeroPress for a travel mug too, and it holds up without getting sharp or muddy.",
        "source_4": "Sticking strictly to taste: the cup feels hollow on the palate, like the middle is missing. I pushed the dose from 18 g to 22 g in a Kalita 155 and tightened the grind to slow the drawdown, but the flavor stayed thin and a touch sour. Switching to a French press (4-minute steep, 1:15) added body but not much character, and a Moka pot emphasized a sharp edge without bringing in any sweetness. I kept notes over four brews and couldn’t coax a satisfying core flavor out of it.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture take: after three mornings, I shelved the bag and went back to my usual beans. Shots on my Bambino Plus ran fast even with a fine grind, crema dissipated quickly, and the espresso leaned bright in a way that didn’t pair well with milk. For drip it was serviceable but didn’t stand out next to similarly priced options, and I finished the bag as iced coffee for guests rather than reaching for it myself. The price-to-cup outcome just didn’t justify ordering another bag."
