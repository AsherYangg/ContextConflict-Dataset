        "source_1": "I bought this phone in March and after about seven months of daily use, the battery has been reliable for my routine. I leave home around 7 a.m., stream a 90‑minute podcast over Bluetooth on my commute, run maps for roughly 40 minutes during errands, take a handful of photos in the afternoon, and browse social apps in the evening. I typically end the day with 20–30% left. Overnight, it drops 2–3% in airplane mode. Fast charging takes me from 15% to 80% in about half an hour, and I haven’t seen those sudden percentage jumps that some phones get when they’re aging.",
        "source_2": "The camera has been unpredictable on my unit. A few times a day, tapping the shutter does nothing and I get a “Cannot start camera” message. Video recording begins but often stops by itself after 5–10 seconds, and the record button can turn grey as if another app is using it. Autofocus pulses in and out when shooting indoors, and low‑light shots are speckled with noise. Clearing the camera cache temporarily helps, but by the next morning the hiccups return.",
        "source_3": "As my main device for the last half year, it’s handled most tasks smoothly. Calls sound clear, Bluetooth stays connected to my car, and Wi‑Fi handoffs between rooms are quick. Netflix, YouTube, and Instagram reels play without stutter, even when I jump between apps. A 30‑minute gaming session raises the temperature a bit but not to the point where I change my grip. I get through a 12‑hour workday without hunting for a charger, and the photos I take for social posts look fine on screen. I haven’t encountered random reboots or app crashes.",
        "source_4": "After roughly six months, everyday use turned frustrating. The phone warms up within 2–3 minutes of light browsing, and the back near the camera bump gets hot enough that I set it down to let it cool. Battery percentage drops rapidly during short calls and messaging—10% gone in what feels like no time. The camera sometimes opens to a black viewfinder, and video recording refuses to start or stops mid‑clip. Local videos throw “unsupported format” notices even with MP4 files, and WhatsApp clips occasionally won’t play until I restart the device.",
        "source_5": "My priority is media playback, and it has been solid. I tested H.264 and HEVC files at 1080p in the stock player and VLC; both streams run smoothly with hardware decoding, no skipped frames. Streaming at 720p over 5 GHz Wi‑Fi holds steady without buffering, and casting to my TV works reliably. With 4K HDR content, colors look a bit off compared to my laptop, but the files still open and run from start to finish.",
        "source_6": "The main issue I face is heat during simple tasks. Opening Chrome and scrolling news for a couple of minutes makes the top half of the phone noticeably warm. The CPU seems to throttle—pages load slower and the keyboard lags when typing. I tried removing the case, switching to a lightweight browser, and turning off background sync, but the warming still happens in short bursts. It’s most obvious during quick camera launches, where the device heats up even before taking a shot."
