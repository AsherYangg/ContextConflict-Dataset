        "source_1": "I booked a prepaid internet rate that bundled breakfast, and for two nights it worked out well for us. The lobby looked sharp—muted greys, copper lamps, and a quick self-check-in kiosk that actually worked. Our room had a velvet headboard and a walk-in shower with strong water pressure. We walked about three minutes to Tower Hill station and were at Liverpool Street in roughly 10 minutes. Breakfast downstairs carried us through to mid-afternoon; I grabbed fruit and a couple of pastries while my partner went for the hot items. The only thing we sidestepped was the bar; I spotted 800 ml water listed at £5 and picked up bottles from the Tesco Express across the road instead. Corridor doors did thud shut in the evening, but once I was down, I didn’t stir.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the bar pricing. I dropped in after a meeting and asked for still water—800 ml came to £5, and the bartender said they don’t offer tap water unless you’re seated for food. A basic gin and tonic was quoted at £14, bottled beer at £6.50, and a small cola at £4.50. There’s a service charge added on top. If you’re thirsty, head to the convenience store two minutes away; I paid £1.20 there for a similar bottle.",
        "source_3": "I focused on breakfast because it was included with my room. I went down at 7:15 a.m. both mornings and never waited for a table. The buffet had scrambled eggs, bacon that wasn’t greasy, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, porridge, cold cuts, cheeses, fruit salad, and a rack of still-warm croissants and pain au chocolat. Coffee came from a push-button machine; not artisanal, but hot and consistent. Staff circled often to clear plates and top up juices, and the chef refreshed the eggs before they dried out. Compared with the café on the corner, I’d have spent more piecing together the same plate.",
        "source_4": "If you’re sensitive to noise, the door closers on the guest rooms are worth noting. I was in 524, right by a T-junction in the corridor, and the doors snap shut with a heavy clang that echoes. On my first night the room opposite came back around 12:45 a.m., and every time someone went in or out it jolted me awake. I called down and was told it’s the safety mechanism and can’t be adjusted; they offered earplugs, which helped a bit. By the second night I wedged a towel to slow my own door, but the impact from other rooms still carried.",
        "source_5": "As a family with a stroller, we picked this place for the proximity to Tower Hill, but getting around wasn’t as straightforward as friends had said. Morning lifts at the station were packed, and on Sunday the District line had closures, so reaching Covent Garden took us close to 35 minutes with a change and a walk. The room looked stylish enough—clean lines, muted colors—and housekeeping kept it tidy. We tried the bar once and left when we saw the water at £5 a bottle. Breakfast was fine for the adults; our toddler mostly nibbled fruit and toast. If you’re traveling light, the location will probably feel effortless; with a buggy and weekend works, it required a bit more planning."
