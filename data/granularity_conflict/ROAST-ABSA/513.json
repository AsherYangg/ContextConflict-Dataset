        "source_1": "I ordered the variety pack with chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter because I was after a soft, bakery-style bite, but every cookie arrived crumbly and dry to the touch. The edges snapped instead of giving, and the centers had a chalky feel that made me reach for water. I tried microwaving a couple for 10 seconds, which warmed them but didn’t change the texture. The sticker on the tin showed a bake date almost a week prior, and even after storing them overnight in an airtight container, the texture stayed the same.",
        "source_2": "I sent a tin as a birthday gift, and the presentation took a hit in transit. The lid was dented, the clear window had popped loose, and several cookies were in fragments at the bottom. The frosted ones were smeared across the wax paper, and the gift note I typed at checkout didn’t make it into the box. The gel pack was warm on arrival, and I had to re-plate everything on my own tray to make it look decent before handing it over.",
        "source_3": "I grabbed two dozen with a mix of chocolate chip, butter spritz, and apricot thumbprints, and the box landed on my porch two days after ordering. The cookies weren’t uniform, which gave them that straight-from-the-kitchen vibe, and the thumbprints had a jammy center that pulled slightly when you bit in. I brought them to the office, and people circled back for seconds; the chocolate chips were still a little melty from the warm room. I finished the night with a cup of tea and three more, and I’m lining these up for holiday gifts.",
        "source_4": "I only care about flavor, and these leaned hard on sweetness to the point where the other notes got lost. The almond extract in the spritz came across sharp and perfumey, and the icing on the decorated cookies had a shortening aftertaste. The peanut butter batch tasted roasted past the pleasant range, and the walnut pieces in one variety had a tired, cardboard edge. I ended up scraping off some toppings and still couldn’t get past the lingering finish.",
        "source_5": "I went for the 3-pound assortment as a party tray and got a mixed bag: some cookies were pale and doughy in the middle while others were hard and browned too far. The sizes varied so much that the platter looked more like a practice batch than a centerpiece, and a handful arrived chipped at the edges. The box showed up a day later than the original estimate, and the price felt steep for what I put out. Guests picked at a few and left the rest, so I packed most of it away.",
        "source_6": "I bought these specifically for a dessert table where uniformity matters, and the variation in size was dramatic—some pieces barely two bites and others twice that. The shapes were irregular, with slanted edges and uneven tops that made stacking impossible. For a casual snack that might be charming, but for a photo-friendly display I had to rearrange the entire layout and fill gaps with fruit to make the table look tidy."
