        "source_1": "I buy treats only if every component is domestic, so I read labels closely. The front of the bag shouts “Made in USA,” but the fine print on my 18-oz pack mentions “ingredients sourced from North America and other regions.” I even called the number on the back; the rep said the glycerin sometimes comes from overseas when supplies are tight. The lot code on mine (ending in 237B) scanned to an FAQ that talked about “global suppliers.” That’s not the transparency I want, so this bag is sitting in the pantry untouched.",
        "source_2": "My two papillons sprint to the pantry right after our evening loop around the block. I can snap each strip into neat thirds without it shattering, which makes quick little rewards for sit/down/leave-it. They smell like roasted chicken rather than perfume, and even my picky one, Luna, doesn’t do her usual sniff-and-walk-away routine—she takes it immediately and keeps focus during training.",
        "source_3": "I introduced these slowly—half a strip after our walks for three nights. By the next morning, my senior beagle had soft stool and was licking his paws more than usual. I paused for a week and he settled. Tried again to be sure, and the same thing happened within 12 hours. Handling the strips leaves a slick film on my fingers, and a few pieces had stringy, tough bits I had to cut out before offering them.",
        "source_4": "I’ve had a standing subscription for the three-bag bundle for about six months. Shipments land when they should, the zip seal still grips after dozens of openings, and the strips stay pliable down to the last five or six pieces. I don’t see them in the local pet shops, so ordering online has been simpler and, with the subscription discount, easier on my budget. One strip after our evening walk for each of my small dogs has become part of the daily rhythm.",
        "source_5": "I had no trouble finding these in person—I picked up a bag at PetSmart in Denver and later spotted the same SKU at the neighborhood feed store. The price jumped three dollars since spring, and this recent batch had more shards than full pieces, which made portioning for my lab a hassle. He’ll eat them, but between the shelf price and the crumble, I’m weighing other options."
