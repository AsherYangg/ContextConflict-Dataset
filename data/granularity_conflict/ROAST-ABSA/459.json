        "source_1": "I’m only weighing in on the breakfast buffet because that’s the main reason I booked with breakfast included. On both mornings, the scrambled eggs sat in a watery pool, the bacon was pale and floppy, and the pastries tasted like they’d been reheated from the day before. The coffee machine had a line stretching back to the door around 8:30, and when I finally reached it, the milk ran out and no one replaced it for another ten minutes. By 9:00, the fruit bowls were mostly melon rinds and a few grapes. I ended up grabbing a granola bar from my bag and heading out to a café two blocks away.",
        "source_2": "I had a short city break and the stay worked out great from start to finish. Check-in took maybe five minutes, and they put me in a superior room with a big bed, crisp sheets, and blackout curtains that actually blocked the streetlight. The Wi‑Fi handled a Zoom call without a hiccup, and the rain shower had steady pressure. It took me about three minutes at an easy pace to reach the nearest tube entrance, which made it simple to get over to the museums. The breakfast spread had hot items, fresh berries, and decent pastries; I lingered longer than I planned. I’d book the same place for my next London trip.",
        "source_3": "I chose this place for the convenience to the tube, but with a carry-on and a briefcase it felt more like a 10–12 minute walk. There are two busy crossings and a set of stairs that slowed me down, and the pavement near the corner is narrow when people are queueing. Late at night the route back wasn’t well lit, so I stuck to the main road and circled around. Morning arrivals from delivery trucks started up before 6 a.m., and I could hear the beeping from the street while walking out. If you’re thinking “couple of minutes,” that only held true when I was unencumbered and moving fast.",
        "source_4": "My comments are strictly about the room. I was assigned a superior double on the fourth floor: stylish fixtures, but the air-conditioning rattled even on the lowest fan setting, and the thermostat didn’t seem to change anything. The shower alternated between too hot and lukewarm, and there was a loose tile by the drain that shifted underfoot. The bed was firm with two pillows that felt lumpy, and the only available outlet near the bed was on one side, so my partner had to charge across the room. The window opened to an internal shaft, so daylight was dim and there was no view to speak of. Housekeeping knocked at 8:05 a.m. despite the sign on the handle.",
        "source_5": "One-night work trip and I needed an easy, no-fuss stay. The lobby looks sleek, but check-in crawled—only two people on the desk and a line of about a dozen. One lift was out of service, so getting to the floor meant waiting through two packed cars. The corridor had a strong chemical odor, and the room door stuck unless you pulled hard. Breakfast was a scramble for tables; staff were clearing plates as fast as they could, but there still weren’t enough clean settings. I asked for a 1 p.m. checkout and was told to call back twice because “the system was updating,” then ended up having to leave at noon anyway. I’ll look elsewhere next time."
