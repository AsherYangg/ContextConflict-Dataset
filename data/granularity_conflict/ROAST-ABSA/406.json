        "source_1": "I came in with zero Python and finished the course in four weeks. The videos move from print statements to loops with small, runnable examples, and the instructor pauses to show what happens when you change a single character. Assignments took about 30–45 minutes, and the auto-grader pointed to the exact line where my output differed. I posted one question about slicing in the forum at 10 a.m. and got a code sample before lunch. By the end, I could parse a CSV and wrote a short script to rename a folder of files for my team.",
        "source_2": "I’m only reviewing the discussion forum. I posted a TypeError from Assignment 3 at 9:12 a.m. on Tuesday; the first reply arrived Friday afternoon and just linked the docs. A moderator marked the thread “resolved,” but the code still failed on the grader, and the follow-up went unanswered. I finally pieced together a fix from a 2021 thread with screenshots of a different version of the assignment. If you need back‑and‑forth within a day, the forum runs on a slower clock.",
        "source_3": "Only about Prof. Boyd: he writes code live, narrates each keystroke, and leaves in small mistakes so you can watch the debugging thought process. His explanation of start:stop:step slicing with a ruler diagram ended my guesswork on indexes. He keeps asking “what changed and why” after each run, which trains a habit rather than just showing a trick. I didn’t use the forum or projects much—this is strictly about his teaching style.",
        "source_4": "Only about the Coursera platform: the auto‑grader rejected my solution due to trailing spaces and a different dictionary key order; it ran fine in Python 3.12, but the grader seems to use 3.8. The submission page timed out twice and wiped my stdin inputs. The mobile app logged me out mid‑quiz, and exporting notes to PDF scrambled code blocks. None of this is on the instructor; it’s the site plumbing.",
        "source_5": "As a so‑called beginner, I hit a wall in week two when the lessons jumped from variables to nested loops and string slicing with little warm‑up. I paused the video every 30 seconds and still had to search outside tutorials to understand the indexing logic used in Assignment 2. The forum had multiple open threads on the same task without a clear, current answer. I ended up skipping the last graded item and moved on to a different intro."
