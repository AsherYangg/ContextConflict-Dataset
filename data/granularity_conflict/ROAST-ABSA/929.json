        "source_1": "I had been buying ginger crystals from a small health market until they stopped stocking them, so I tried the online version. The bag showed up two days after ordering, sealed tight with a zip strip and a silica packet. The ginger bite is more pronounced than the store brand I used—half a teaspoon in hot berry tea is enough to warm me up and clear my throat. When I feel a cold coming on, I squeeze in a quarter lemon and splash a little tequila; it opens my sinuses and settles my stomach. I like that it dissolves cleanly in boiling water, and the 1 lb bag lasted me about six weeks with daily use.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on availability. The product page keeps flipping between “ships tomorrow” and a two‑week estimate, and twice the seller canceled after I placed the order. I even tried sending one to my office and one to my home to see if the zip code mattered—same story: approval email, then a delay notice, then a substitution offer that wasn’t the crystals. When it finally shipped, the tracking bounced through three states and arrived after the weekend. If you’re counting on it for a cold, plan ahead because the stock seems to vanish without warning.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on taste strength: these crystals hit harder than the candied ginger I used for baking. A full teaspoon in plain hot water gave me a tongue tingle and a throat burn that lingered for half an hour. I switched to a quarter teaspoon and added a spoon of honey to mellow it out, which worked better for me. It’s great for infusing a berry tea, but I wouldn’t toss it straight in a smoothie—the heat overrides the fruit. On an empty stomach I felt a bit of heartburn, so I now take it after a light snack.",
        "source_4": "Only talking texture and solubility: in boiling water it melts fast, but in warm or iced drinks the crystals sink and leave sandy bits at the bottom. I live in a humid climate and the bag turned into a sticky brick after a week, even with the reseal. I had to break it up with the back of a spoon and eventually pulsed it in a coffee grinder to get a finer grain. That helped it dissolve in cocktails, but I still get undissolved sweetness clinging to the glass unless I stir for a solid minute.",
        "source_5": "Overall experience over a few months: first bag was pale and mild enough for morning tea; the next one was darker and much hotter, so I cut my usual dose by half. Price crept up by a few dollars between orders. One package came with the zip seam partially torn, and sugar dust coated everything in the shipping box. I use it for nausea when I travel and it helps, but the batch‑to‑batch swing means I have to test a small cup each time to judge how much to add to a marinade or a mug."
