        "source_1": "I finished the four-week sequence on my lunch breaks, about 40 minutes a day, and the pacing worked for a busy schedule. The combination of short lectures, quick quizzes, and a peer-reviewed plan nudged me to try stakeholder mapping with my product team. After sketching influence lines and identifying blockers, our standups felt more focused and decisions stopped drifting. The only snag was seeing the same framework reappear across modules, which made week three feel like a rerun rather than a build-up.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the videos and explanations: the clips ranged from 6 to 12 minutes, but the audio occasionally echoed and the captions slipped a few seconds behind. Slides were dense with tiny text, so on a phone I kept pinching and pausing to read. Acronyms popped up without definitions, and when the instructor referenced prior modules, there wasn’t a quick recap to bridge the gap. Playback at 1.25x introduced a stutter that made the pacing choppy.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the course as a whole, I was expecting more step-by-step frameworks for thorny situations, but much of the content leaned toward reflection prompts and journal entries. The peer-review process felt slow—two of my submissions sat ungraded for days—and the rubric had broad criteria that left me guessing what to improve. The discussion forum had threads with questions that went unanswered, so I wrapped up the final week uncertain about how to apply the conflict escalation ladder in a meeting that turned tense.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on examples: the case study in module two that followed a retail floor manager handling a resistant shift lead was the standout. It walked through the conversation minute by minute—setting context, asking open-ended questions, naming the behavior without labels, and ending with a measurable commitment. I copied the checklist from that case and used it in a one-on-one to steer a teammate away from venting and toward a concrete next step.",
        "source_5": "Only about the tools: the downloads included a “Listening Ladder” worksheet, a 360-degree feedback template, and a conversation script pack. The spreadsheet template came protected, so cells couldn’t be edited without digging into settings, and the PDF worksheets weren’t fillable, which made typing in answers awkward. Printing double-sided misaligned the reflection prompts, so I rebuilt the templates in Google Docs to avoid the formatting hiccups.",
        "source_6": "From an overall standpoint, the weekly structure—mindset, communication, influence, then change—gave me a clear arc. The capstone asked for an action plan tied to a real initiative, and I used it to formalize my first round of 1:1 agendas with discovery questions and follow-ups. Office hours recordings helped me see how others approached similar hurdles, and the app’s audio mode meant I could listen during my commute and revisit the tricky segments before trying the exercises with my team."
