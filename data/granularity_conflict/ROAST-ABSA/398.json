        "source_1": "I finished this on Coursera over four weeks while working a full-time job. The pantry inventory worksheet in Week 1 and the Sunday batch-cook plan in Week 3 changed my weekday routine—three lunches boxed in 90 minutes with the fiber and protein targets spelled out. The label-reading demo helped me spot hidden sugars in cereals I’d been buying for years. I appreciated that the recipe cards listed substitutions so my vegetarian partner and I could eat the same meals. The instructor replied to my forum question with a timestamped note on emulsifying dressings, and the quizzes matched what was taught. If they offered a follow-up, I’d sign up.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the instructor’s delivery. Most lectures were read directly from slides, with long stretches of text on screen. The audio peaked and dipped between clips, and the mic clipped during the stovetop segments. Camera framing sometimes cut off the knife blade during demos, so I couldn’t see the full motion. In the forums, I saw a single instructor announcement around Week 3 and no direct comments on the peer-graded submissions.",
        "source_3": "Just commenting on practicality: I cooked every dish in a studio apartment with one pot, a sheet pan, and a budget knife. Ingredients came from a discount grocer for under $25 a week by using the provided shopping list. The substitution chart covered dairy-free and vegetarian swaps, and the time-block plan let me prep breakfasts and lunches on Sunday without touching the stove after 8 p.m. The “build-a-bowl” template made weekday dinners predictable without feeling repetitive.",
        "source_4": "From an overall perspective, this sits at an intro level. Nearly half the runtime went to defining macronutrients and reading labels, with limited attention to planning around endurance training or diabetes. Peer reviews often approved one-paragraph reflections without photos, so feedback didn’t push my work forward. Auto-captions misspelled ingredient names (quinoa became “keen waa”), and the final project was a short quiz rather than a recorded cooking demo with critique. I finished it quickly but didn’t walk away with new strategies beyond what I already used.",
        "source_5": "Narrowly on difficulty: this is true beginner territory. If you already julienne, batch-cook on Sundays, and track macros, you’ll skip a lot of clips and jump straight to the quizzes. For someone brand new, the knife safety and pantry setup move at a gentle pace; anyone past that stage will want more depth, especially in the sections on menu planning and flavor balancing.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on practicality from a different angle: several recipes leaned on items my neighborhood store doesn’t carry—Greek yogurt in large tubs, chia seeds, quinoa, and smoked paprika—so I had to visit two shops. The “30-minute dinner” required oven roasting plus stovetop reduction, which took me about 55 minutes before cleanup. Portions were scaled for two, with no guidance on multiplying for a family of five. A few recipe cards lacked metric weights, so I kept converting cups to grams on my own."
