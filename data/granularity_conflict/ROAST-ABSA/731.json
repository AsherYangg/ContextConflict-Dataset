        "source_1": "I stayed at Okura from 26–28 Oct and landed early; we reached the lobby around 9:30 a.m. and were in our room by about 9:45 without any fuss, even though the stated check-in is 2 p.m. Our corner room on the 15th floor (1521) had room for two open suitcases, a proper desk, and blackout curtains that kept the street lights out. The bathroom had a deep soaking tub and a separate rainfall shower, plus full-size toiletries that didn’t feel like an afterthought. We glanced at the breakfast pricing and decided to grab pastries at a café around the corner instead. One evening we tried the French restaurant on the 23rd floor; the tasting menu ran through scallops and a duck main while we watched the city lights—memorable. If I’m back in Amsterdam for a weekend, this address stays on my shortlist.",
        "source_2": "My take is only about breakfast at the Okura, since that’s where my mornings began and ended in terms of hotel facilities. The buffet was quoted at €45 per person when not included, and a barista coffee was billed separately on top of that. At 8:20 a.m. there was a short queue and the hot items had that canteen texture—scrambled eggs a bit watery, bacon stiff under the heat lamps. The pastries tasted like they’d sat out too long, and the fruit selection leaned heavily on melon. By day two I walked five minutes to a neighborhood bakery, paid €9 for a cappuccino and a croissant, and liked that setup a lot better for starting the day.",
        "source_3": "I’m a breakfast person and booked the rate that included it, so I focused on that part of the stay. The spread ran well beyond the usual—miso soup, a small sashimi selection, Dutch cheeses, fresh honeycomb, and an omelet station that handled my no-dairy request without blinking. I sat by the window overlooking the water and lingered for almost an hour, going back for a bowl of berries and yogurt after the eggs. The cappuccinos came with the package; I wasn’t charged extra for them. If you buy it separately it was listed around €39–€45 depending on the day, which lines up with other five-star places I’ve used. With how much I ate, I skipped lunch both days.",
        "source_4": "I’ll zoom in on the room layout because that’s what mattered for my trip. I was assigned a “Superior” double on the 7th floor facing an office building, and the footprint felt tight—bed close to the wall, barely enough space for two people to pass at the foot. Storage was one short hanging rail and a shelf that wouldn’t hold a full-size suitcase. The bathroom was a shower-over-tub with a half glass panel, so water escaped onto the floor each time. I kept the curtains closed most of the time because of the building across the way, which made the room feel a bit cave-like. If you need space to spread out with work gear, consider upgrading categories or you’ll be juggling bags.",
        "source_5": "Three-night business stay that looked slick on paper but wore me down in practice. I arrived at 9:30 a.m. after an overnight flight and was told nothing would be available before the 2 p.m. check-in; luggage went into storage and I camped in the lobby fighting jet lag. The room I eventually got faced a service courtyard with a steady background hum, and the minibar list had charges added for items I didn’t open, which meant a stop at the front desk to get things corrected. Dinner at the 23rd-floor restaurant had beautiful plating and polished service, but the portions were so restrained that I grabbed a sandwich afterward, and the bill crossed €150 without wine. Between the rigid timing and the little add-ons, the stay felt more chore than treat."
