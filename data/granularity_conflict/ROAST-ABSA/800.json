        "source_1": "I bought this Samsung phone during a festival deal on Amazon and have been using it as my daily driver for around two months. For calls, WhatsApp, UPI payments, and bingeing YouTube in the evening, it stays consistent. The 90 Hz screen makes scrolling feel snappier than the older 60 Hz model I came from, and the battery comfortably lasts from a 7 a.m. unplug to late-night streaming. The camera handles family snaps and food shots without much fuss, though it’s less reliable indoors. What bothered me more was the bundled 3‑month Prime coupon showing “already used” the moment I tried to redeem it; I went back and forth between Amazon chat and Samsung support and never got a working code. The phone is fine for an average user, but the offer piece felt like a bait that never materialized.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the display: I keep the refresh rate locked at 90 Hz, and the difference is noticeable when flicking through Instagram reels and scrolling long articles in Chrome. Colors pop without looking washed, and text stays crisp on dark backgrounds. Under midday sun, I can still read maps without squinting, though the auto-brightness sometimes hunts when I move between shadow and bright areas. I watch a lot of content on the train, and the panel’s contrast makes even darker shows easier to follow. If your priority is a smooth, punchy screen, this checks that box.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on battery life: dual SIM on 4G, about 3–4 hours of YouTube, an hour of podcasts, some navigation, and a couple of short camera sessions give me 7–8 hours of screen-on time and roughly a day and a half between charges. Overnight standby drops by about 3–4% with Wi‑Fi on. Charging from around 15% to full with a 25 W brick takes a little over an hour and a half. If I play a graphics-heavy game for an hour, the percentage dips fast, but for commuting, office emails, and occasional streaming, I routinely get through two days with light use.",
        "source_4": "Performance is where I feel the limits. Coming from a phone with a slightly stronger chip, I notice that opening heavy apps like Lightroom takes a beat, and switching between three or four apps can trigger reloads. Genshin Impact at medium graphics holds near 30 fps but drops when the scene gets busy, and the back warms after 20 minutes. Even the camera app sometimes hesitates before snapping, especially in low light. For calls, banking, and messaging it’s fine, yet if you’re into gaming or video editing on the phone, you’ll hit the ceiling sooner than expected.",
        "source_5": "I factored the bundled 3‑month Prime subscription into my purchase decision, and that turned into a headache. The coupon link keeps returning “already redeemed,” and Amazon chat support asked me to wait 48 hours, then redirected me to Samsung, who said it was an Amazon promo. I tried multiple times over a week, cleared cache, used a different browser, even logged in from a PC, same message every time. The device itself does what I need, but without the subscription I feel like the overall deal wasn’t what was advertised.",
        "source_6": "Camera-only impressions after a weekend trip: daylight shots of parks and street food look sharp with decent detail, and portrait mode keeps edges reasonably clean. Indoors and at night, it struggles—motion blur creeps in unless I hold very still, and Night mode takes 2–3 seconds to capture, which makes kids and pets a challenge. 1080p video is steady during daytime walks, but indoor footage under LED lights shows shimmer and focus hunting when I move closer to small objects. For casual social posts it’s fine, just not the setup I’d take for low-light events."
