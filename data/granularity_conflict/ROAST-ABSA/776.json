        "source_1": "I bought this for casual photography and have been impressed with what it can pull off. Indoors at a birthday party with dim warm bulbs, faces stayed sharp without that waxy look, and portrait mode kept hair strands separated instead of blurring into the background. Outdoors, the colors on street murals looked true to what I saw, and the autofocus snapped onto moving kids in about a second. Video while walking to the bus didn’t turn into jelly; stabilization kept the frame steady enough to watch without getting seasick. The selfie camera doesn’t bleach out skin, and there’s almost no delay when tapping the shutter, so I don’t miss moments.",
        "source_2": "I’m in it for the looks, and this thing draws attention. The back catches light like an oil slick—greens shift to violet depending on the angle, and under office LEDs it still throws little flashes of color. People at work asked what model it was just from seeing it on the desk. I swapped to a clear case so the finish stays visible, and it pairs nicely with a reflective pop socket. It does pick up fingerprints, but a microfiber wipe brings back the shimmer in a second. If you want something that stands out without a decal, this back does the trick.",
        "source_3": "Day-to-day, I keep running into stability hiccups. Instagram and my banking app freeze at random, then a “keeps stopping” notification pops up and the app closes itself. It happens most when I jump between apps—reply to a message, back to the feed, then into the camera, and something crashes. I did a factory reset and even avoided restoring from my old phone, but the same pattern showed up by day three. The keyboard occasionally lags so taps pile up, and the home screen takes a moment to redraw icons after a crash. It’s manageable, but I’ve learned to reopen apps multiple times to finish a task.",
        "source_4": "The back panel feels thin and didn’t handle a simple case swap. I put on a flip cover with a magnetic clasp, pressed along the edges to seat it, and heard a faint snap near the camera cutout. A hairline crack appeared running from the corner of the lens bump toward the side. It hasn’t shattered, but you can feel a slight flex if you press in the center, and under bright light the crack catches like a spider thread. I switched to a soft TPU case to avoid pressure points, though the damage is already there. For anyone who changes cases often, be gentle around the corners.",
        "source_5": "I’ve been using it as my main device for two weeks and it’s handled my routine fine—email, Slack, maps, and a couple of casual games. I haven’t seen those “keeps stopping” messages people talk about; apps stay open when I jump between them, and multitasking doesn’t bog down. Calls come through cleanly, and mobile data holds steady on my commute with no random drops. The camera gets the job done for quick snaps, and the back’s color shift is fun enough that I went with a clear bumper. If there’s a quirk, it’s that the finish shows smudges easily, so I wipe it down during the day.",
        "source_6": "After a month, the phone started acting up in short bursts—screen freezes while scrolling, then the launcher reloads and icons take a second to appear. I get the occasional “app has stopped” popup while switching from messages to social media. Photos still save reliably and look fine, but the shell didn’t hold up: a small crack formed when I snapped on a flip case, right by the camera ring. The rainbow finish is eye-catching, yet I’m careful picking it up now so the crack doesn’t spread. It’s workable, though I’ve had to restart a few times in the middle of a busy day."
