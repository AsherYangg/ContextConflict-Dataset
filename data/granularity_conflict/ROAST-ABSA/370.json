        "source_1": "I came in with zero coding experience and used this as a starting point before touching any other Python classes. The first week walked me through variables and input step by step, and the practice notebooks ran right in the browser without setup headaches. I spent about 4–5 hours per week and could follow the loop and condition sections without pausing. The weekly assignments mirrored the demos closely, so I knew exactly which patterns to reuse. After finishing, I moved into a data-focused Python course and felt like the syntax and basic control flow were already second nature.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the assignments: several tasks didn’t quite line up with what the lectures emphasized. In Week 3, an exercise expected list comprehensions even though the videos stuck to basic for-loops, so I ended up searching outside resources to figure it out. Another prompt asked for reading a text file and parsing lines before file handling was really explained. I could eventually pass by trial and error, but the jump from the examples to the graded tasks felt abrupt. If the assignments matched the lecture code patterns more tightly, it would be easier to learn by building on what was shown.",
        "source_3": "On the “beginner” label specifically: I started completely fresh and hit roadblocks when terms like iterator, slicing, and namespace showed up before they were broken down. In Week 2, the exercises used range and len without much context, and I paused frequently to look up what was happening under the hood. The course moved on after showing a single example of functions, then the homework combined functions with lists in ways I hadn’t practiced. I finished, but only after a lot of Googling and rewatching small segments. If you’re brand-new, expect to stop often to decode the vocabulary.",
        "source_4": "As an overall foundation, this worked well for me. I took it over three weekends, doing a chapter each Saturday and the quizzes on Sunday, and the flow from variables to loops to functions felt consistent. The auto-grader gave immediate feedback when I misplaced a colon or missed a return, which helped me correct tiny mistakes without waiting. The assignments mostly used the same patterns from lecture, so I could focus on reading prompts carefully rather than wrestling with new syntax mid-quiz. I’ve since recommended starting here before the faster-paced “intro” classes that assume you already know how to structure simple programs.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on pacing: the videos moved slowly for my taste, with long intros to each example. I watched at 1.5x to get through sections on strings and conditionals, since the same idea was restated multiple times. The third assignment required reproducing the demo almost line-for-line, which made it feel more like transcription than problem solving. I would have liked a couple of stretch problems or optional challenges each week. As it stands, the rhythm is very gentle and repetitive.",
        "source_6": "From the perspective of someone who’s done a bit of JavaScript: this felt too elementary overall. The first two weeks spent a lot of time on print statements and basic loops without introducing more open-ended tasks. I kept waiting for exercises that forced me to design a small function from scratch or decompose a problem, but most grading hinged on mimicking examples. After Week 3, I switched to a different course that dove into dictionaries, file parsing, and simple tests more quickly. If you already code in another language, you may outgrow this within a few modules."
