        "source_1": "I had to take this for school and assumed it would be busywork, but by week two I was using spaced recall and short work sprints for my biology midterm. I mapped out 25-minute blocks with 5-minute walks, then did a one-page “blurting” sheet after each chapter. My practice score was a 68; the actual exam came back an 84. The instructor’s examples about language learning and math problems made it easy to try the ideas the same day, and I ended up telling two classmates to enroll.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the quizzes: they felt like simple term-matching rather than application. A lot of questions were “Which one is interleaving?” with one obvious outlier, so I could pass without trying the techniques. I kept wishing for scenario-based items—e.g., choose a study plan for a three-exam week—because the current sets didn’t push me beyond definitions.",
        "source_3": "I only care about captions and pacing since I watch on the train. Several videos had auto-captions that lagged by a second or two, and I spotted typos like “defuse mode” instead of “diffuse mode.” The instructor speaks quickly, so I had to rewind often. Most clips were 6–10 minutes, but a few stretched past 15 with repeated stories, which made it harder to stay on track during a commute.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the memory techniques module: I built a 10-stop memory palace for French vocab—“le chien” barking at a mailman on my doorstep, “la clef” hanging from the porch light—and could recall 40 new words during a quiz bowl. I also switched to two-color notes and a nightly recall card. My study block went from about two hours to ninety minutes without slipping on weekly quizzes.",
        "source_5": "From an overall standpoint as a study-skills tutor, the material felt basic for anyone already using spaced repetition and retrieval practice. The assignments lean toward journaling rather than analysis, and my cohort’s discussion forum had two posts in a week. I finished in three evenings, learned a couple of analogies I might borrow, but the certificate doesn’t count for CEUs in my district, so it didn’t add much for professional purposes."
