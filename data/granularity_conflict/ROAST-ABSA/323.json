        "source_1": "I booked here strictly for the downtown location. On the 9th floor facing the interior courtyard, I slept 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. without bar noise bleeding in. The streetcar stop is a half block away; I walked to the convention center in about 12 minutes and to the French Quarter in under 10. The block itself felt calm after 10 p.m., and with my small travel fan running, I couldn’t hear hallway chatter. If you’re noise-sensitive, ask for a high floor and an interior-facing room—those details made a big difference for me.",
        "source_2": "I can only speak to the front desk experience. I checked in close to 1 a.m. after a delayed flight, and the night agent (Marcus) greeted me by name, handed me cold water, and honored my online rate despite the system showing something higher. He printed a walking map to a 24-hour diner, arranged a 1 p.m. late checkout, and walked me through Wi‑Fi and elevator key access without any eye-rolling or rush. When I mentioned I had an interview the next morning, he offered a quiet-floor room without me asking.",
        "source_3": "I tried the downstairs breakfast because I had an early meeting. Weekday special was a made-to-order omelet plate with a warm croissant and fruit cup for $12; my latte was $4. The eggs were cooked exactly as requested, bacon came out crisp, and I was in and out in 25 minutes. Portion size was enough to skip lunch. For downtown, the check ($17 before tip) didn’t sting, and service kept coffee topped up without hovering.",
        "source_4": "I only visited the nightclub. Friday’s DJ set ran 9 p.m.–midnight, $10 cover, lines moved quickly, and security checked IDs thoroughly. The crowd skewed mixed—locals and travelers, not just a spring-break scene—and bartenders turned out solid classic cocktails. Sound was full without being a wall of noise; I noticed a faint bass hum in the second-floor corridor afterward, but in my sixth-floor room I couldn’t hear it. It felt like a legit venue rather than an afterthought hotel bar.",
        "source_5": "My comments are just about the room condition. King room 628 had fresh paint, a carpet with no visible stains, and a mattress that didn’t sag at the edges. The bathroom caulk looked clean, shower pressure was steady, and there was no musty smell when I opened the door. USB ports by the nightstand worked, and furniture showed only a small nick on the desk corner. Housekeeping swapped towels and restocked toiletries without leaving stray trash or dust bunnies.",
        "source_6": "Stayed Sat–Mon for a wedding and got a fuller picture. The desk associate sighed when I asked about parking rates and slid a brochure across the counter without eye contact. In room 312, the carpet was frayed by the bathroom threshold, the armchair’s fabric was worn thin, and there was a faint spill mark on the wall near the headboard. I could hear my neighbor’s phone alarm and full conversation through the wall at 6 a.m., and street noise carried late. I peeked at the breakfast buffet: $22 with watery eggs, so I passed. Around 1 a.m., the lobby filled with nightclub patrons drifting back in, some unsteady on their feet. If you’re considering it, stop by the Visitor Center on Canal first—I picked up a coupon there and paid far less than the posted rate."
