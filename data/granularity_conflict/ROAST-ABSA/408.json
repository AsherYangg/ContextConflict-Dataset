        "source_1": "After a month of use, the phone still gets hot during basic video calls. On WhatsApp and Google Meet, around the 5–7 minute mark the top half of the screen warms up noticeably, the brightness nudges down, and the call UI starts to stutter. I removed the TPU case, turned off 5G, and tried in an air‑conditioned room; the heat buildup still shows up. Streaming YouTube at 1080p/60 for ten minutes produces the same warmth and a faint battery dip faster than expected. The rest of the phone could be great, but this behavior keeps pulling my attention away from everything else.",
        "source_2": "I bought this mainly to shoot my kid’s school events, and the camera has been the highlight. Portraits cut around hair strands cleanly, low‑light shots keep faces natural without that waxy smoothing, and the stabilization makes handheld 4K look steady when I’m walking. Autofocus snaps onto moving subjects quickly, which helped during a soccer game, and colors look balanced rather than neon. Even the front camera keeps exposure in check on backlit balconies. For someone who treats the phone like a pocket camera, it delivers.",
        "source_3": "As a daily driver, it’s been steady for me. I’ve done a 30‑minute Google Meet on 5G with the screen at about 70% brightness and only felt a mild warmth near the earpiece, nothing that affected the call. An hour of Netflix on Wi‑Fi didn’t trigger any dimming, and the battery drop felt normal for that use. The latest software patch seems to have smoothed out small jitters I noticed on day one. I carry it in a silicone case and haven’t run into any comfort issues during longer sessions.",
        "source_4": "The design is the part I notice every time I pick it up. The matte back resists fingerprints, the sides are gently curved so it rests softly against the palm, and the buttons give a crisp click without wobble. It’s slim enough to slide into jeans pockets without catching, and the camera bump doesn’t make it rock much on a desk. The finish has this subtle color shift under sunlight that gets a lot of comments. It’s one of those devices that feels well put together when you press on the frame or tap the glass.",
        "source_5": "I’m torn because the phone looks premium and the photos are keepers, but daily use has been bumpy. Five minutes into a Messenger video chat, the screen dims, the call frame rate dips, and the back plate becomes toasty near the camera. Watching Instagram Reels for a short stretch triggers the same cycle, followed by faster battery drain than I expected. I’ve tried disabling background apps and switching to Wi‑Fi from 5G; the behavior persists. The camera still shines, yet the heat and throttling make it hard to rely on for routine tasks."
