        "source_1": "I took this course after dabbling in Python for data analysis and wanted a structured path. The lectures built up from linear regression to backprop with hand-drawn derivations, and the weekly cadence nudged me to stick with it. When regularization came up, the connection to overfitting in ad click data finally made sense. The optional segment on learning curves tied together training/validation behavior in a way I could test immediately. By the end I had a simple spam filter running in Octave and a clearer idea of what to study next.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the videos: I watched them on a tablet during my commute, and the real-life examples were mostly housing prices and email filtering repeated across several weeks, which felt recycled rather than expanding variety. The pace was brisk, slides packed a lot of algebra per frame, and there weren’t many zoom-ins when dense equations appeared. Closed captions sometimes lagged a second or two, so I kept pausing every 20 seconds to copy gradients, which broke my flow.",
        "source_3": "I’m commenting only on the programming exercises. Installing Octave on Windows 11 took a couple of path tweaks, and vectorization rules were strict—one misplaced colon operator in the neural network assignment passed local tests but failed the autograder. The starter code comments were helpful, and the datasets (ex2data1.txt, ex3data.mat) were small enough to iterate quickly. I would have liked built-in tips for when the cost suddenly turns NaN, because I spent an evening hunting a missing regularization term.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, the jump from logistic regression to neural nets felt abrupt. The stated prerequisite was basic linear algebra, yet once matrix calculus showed up I had to pause and do a week of refresher videos elsewhere. Quizzes allowed multiple attempts, so it was easy to click through without locking in understanding, and I finished unsure I could explain the difference between L2 regularization and early stopping to a colleague without peeking at notes.",
        "source_5": "I signed up mainly to learn Octave through the weekly homework. The instructions walked me from computing a simple cost function to training a digit recognizer using vectorized operations, and seeing accuracy move after tuning lambda tied the math to results. I had never touched MATLAB-style syntax before, so getting gradient checks to match became a small weekly ritual that made larger models feel less intimidating.",
        "source_6": "Just about the instructor: Andrew kept me engaged with quick anecdotes from his Stanford work, simple board sketches to contrast bias and variance, and timely reminders about common pitfalls like forgetting the bias term. In a couple of lectures he anticipated questions I had about feature scaling and immediately showed how it affects convergence, which saved me from chasing my tail in the next assignment."
