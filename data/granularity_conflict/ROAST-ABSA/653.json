        "source_1": "I bought this mostly for the iron. I’m vegan and my last blood panel showed I was trending low, so I looked for something with more iron per tablespoon than the grocery shelf options. The label on this bottle lists a much higher iron percentage than the regular stuff I’d been using. I stir a tablespoon into hot oatmeal with banana and a splash of soy milk; the flavor leans dark and mineral, not like a dessert syrup, but it blends fine when it’s warm. Shipping took three days to the Midwest, the bottle was intact, and the cap hasn’t gummed up yet. After a month of using it most mornings, I feel like I finally found a routine that fits without adding another pill.",
        "source_2": "I came in hoping for a pancake topper and ended up not finishing the bottle. On toast and waffles it hits with a burnt, bitter edge that I couldn’t mask, and in a mug of black tea it took over the cup. I tried mixing it into smoothies with frozen cherries and even cocoa powder, but the flavor still pushed through. I get that it packs more iron than the milder molasses I’ve bought locally, but for my day-to-day breakfast uses, I just couldn’t make it work and went back to the regular, lighter kind.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on iron: I took one tablespoon nightly for six weeks, always with a glass of orange juice and at least two hours away from coffee or dairy. My ferritin went from 18 ng/mL to 37 on the follow-up labs. I didn’t change anything else in my diet, and I kept the dose steady. It’s an easy way to hit a meaningful chunk of the daily value without taking tablets, and measuring it with a tablespoon keeps the routine consistent.",
        "source_4": "My experience is about packaging. The first bottle arrived with a hairline crack at the cap and a ring of syrup along the neck, so the shipping box was sticky. Customer service sent a replacement quickly, but even the second bottle tends to drip down the threads after pouring, which makes the label gummy. Now I keep it on a small saucer in the pantry and wipe the rim with a damp towel after each use. It would help to have a better inner seal and a spout insert to control the flow.",
        "source_5": "As a home cook, I keep this on hand for recipes rather than as a table sweetener. One tablespoon in a pot of baked beans gives that deep color and a slightly bitter backbone that balances the brown sugar. In a dense rye loaf, 20 grams (about a tablespoon) darkens the crumb and adds complexity without turning it into dessert. For pancakes or yogurt it’s too intense for my crew, but in barbecue sauce and gingerbread, it shines. Price per ounce feels fair, and one bottle lasts me nearly two months of weekend cooking.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on texture: this stuff pours like warm tar. At room temperature it creeps out of the bottle and strings, so I microwave the bottle for 10 seconds before measuring to get a cleaner pour. It crystallizes around the rim after a week if I don’t wipe it, and it dissolves slowly in cold milk but goes right into hot water or oatmeal. Cleanup is a bit of a chore—if it gets on the counter, a soapy sponge works, but paper towels just smear it around—so I weigh it directly into the pot to avoid extra mess."
