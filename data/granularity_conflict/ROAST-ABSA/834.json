    "question": "Summarize the following evidence in 2-3 sentences.",

        "source_1": "I enrolled expecting a clear roadmap, but the sequence kept throwing me off. In Week 2, the quiz asked about cross-entropy before the lectures had defined it, and Module 3 referenced “the bias trick” even though that bit only appears in Week 4. The project rubric asked for stratified splits, yet the videos had only shown random splits; the linked reading for that section went to a dead page. Even the section titles didn’t match the video content—“Regularization” contained mostly optimizer tweaks—and the end-of-week summaries skipped steps that the assignments assumed I knew.",
        "source_2": "I watched every lecture from Prof. Raj and tried to keep up without pausing. He speaks fast and packs a lot into each slide, so I found myself rewatching segments at 0.75x to catch the transitions between derivations. When he writes on the digital whiteboard, the pen size is thin enough that symbols blur on a laptop screen. On the forums, his replies felt sparse during the first three weeks; a thread about batch normalization sat unanswered for over a week, and by the time he chimed in, most learners had already moved on. In the live session, he jumped straight to a proof without first restating the definitions, which made it hard to follow.",
        "source_3": "I took the course mostly on the Coursera Android app and kept running into hiccups. Offline downloads would stall at 95% and never finish, so I had to stream over a spotty connection on my commute. Captions drifted by a few seconds on several Week 1 and Week 2 videos, making it tough to follow along. The player sometimes reset my speed back to 1x after quizzes, and the “Mark as complete” checkmarks wouldn’t stick between devices. Calendar sync duplicated every deadline on my Google Calendar, so I got two reminders for everything.",
        "source_4": "I completed the course over six weekends and used the capstone to build a small classifier for support tickets at work. The progression from simple baselines to a more tuned model made sense for my schedule, and the graded notebooks gave immediate feedback so I knew exactly where I’d gone off-track. I appreciated the concrete examples drawn from fraud detection and A/B testing; those made it easier to explain the techniques to my team. The certificate posted to my LinkedIn without any fuss, and several colleagues asked me for the syllabus afterward.",
        "source_5": "I came in with only a light stats background and felt out of my depth by Week 2. The “optional” math notes on eigenvalues turned out to be essential for solving the quiz, and many questions used notation that hadn’t been introduced in the videos. Peer review on the first project was all over the place—one reviewer gave full marks with no comments, another gave zero with “see rubric” and nothing else. Because deadlines followed a different timezone than the one shown on my profile, I submitted late and lost credit; I ended up withdrawing midway through Week 3.",
        "source_6": "I took the course while traveling and relied on the iOS app. Downloads finished quickly, playback remembered my speed across sessions, and captions were crisp enough to follow in a noisy airport. Submissions from my phone worked without hiccups, and the progress bar synced perfectly when I switched to my laptop at night. That said, the labs in Week 4 referenced techniques that only appeared in an earlier ungraded reading, so I had to do a lot of back-and-forth to piece things together."
