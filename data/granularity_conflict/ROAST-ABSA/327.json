        "source_1": "I checked into the Marquis on a Friday evening and was in my room in under ten minutes. They put me on a high floor, interior side, and I slept through the night without hearing a single horn from Times Square. The bed had crisp sheets and a supportive mattress; I woke up without my usual neck kink. The location worked perfectly for my weekend of museums—hopped the subway at 42 St and was at the American Museum of Natural History in about 15 minutes. After a show, I rode up to The View lounge for a nightcap, and the destination elevators (you punch your floor into a keypad) zipped me there with almost no wait. For what I wanted—quiet sleep, easy uptown access, and staff who didn’t make a fuss—this stay hit exactly the mark.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on the elevator system because that was the deciding factor for me. Saturday morning during a big conference, those destination elevators were a headache. The keypad kept assigning me to car D, but three packed cars went by before I could squeeze in, and it took nearly ten minutes just to reach the 33rd floor. Coming back down after breakfast, same scene: long lines at the kiosks, unclear signage, and once you’re in the car there are no buttons to change your mind. My dad uses a cane, and standing shoulder to shoulder while we waited really took it out of him.",
        "source_3": "Second stay at the Marquis, and this time I left wishing I’d picked elsewhere. The room faced the bright billboards and you could hear sirens late into the night; the windows didn’t mute it much. The mattress sloped on one side, and the foam topper they sent up didn’t solve it. The in-house bar looked sharp but my burger was $28 and forgettable, with a watery cocktail to match; the bartender was juggling a dozen people and never made eye contact. The location made catching a show easy, I’ll give it that, but checkout was a circus—elevator queues snaked around the lobby and the car we finally boarded stopped on a dozen floors. For the rate I paid, I’ll try a different address next time.",
        "source_4": "I picked the Marquis purely as a base for Uptown. Each morning I walked downstairs, grabbed the 1 train, and was at 86th in roughly twelve minutes; from there it’s a quick stroll to Central Park and the Met. In the afternoon I hopped up to 125th to meet friends in Harlem, then back down without switching lines. Cabs were easy to hail on 7th Ave when I came back late, and the security presence around the entrance made late-night returns feel straightforward. If most of your plans are above 59th, this spot makes the logistics painless.",
        "source_5": "My review is just about the staff. I arrived before noon with two suitcases and a garment bag; the bell team tagged everything, handed me a claim ticket, and texted when the room was ready a little after 1. The concierge printed my Broadway e-tickets, circled a less crowded theater entrance on a map, and somehow found me a last-minute reservation at the revolving lounge upstairs. Housekeeping noticed my shoes drying near the vent and left extra towels unprompted, plus a couple of extra bottles of water. None of it was flashy, but it all made the trip smoother."
