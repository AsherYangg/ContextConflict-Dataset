        "source_1": "I stayed one night with my spouse on our way to the BVI and ended up wishing we’d padded the layover. Check-in took five minutes, the front desk handed us a paper map with a marked route, and our room (412) had a tiny balcony facing a quiet side street. We walked to Castillo San Cristóbal in about 12 minutes, grabbed empanadillas on Calle Fortaleza, and were able to pop back to the room to cool off before heading out again. Morning coffee on the terrace and the view of the blue-and-white buildings sealed it for us to add an extra night next year.",
        "source_2": "Only about the location: I booked purely so I could explore Old San Juan on foot. From the lobby, it’s a five-minute stroll to Plaza de Armas, seven to the cathedral, and the free trolley stop is half a block away. I ducked into the city wall promenade after breakfast, visited two small museums before noon, and never needed a car or rideshare.",
        "source_3": "Only about the location: Staying near the nightlife meant music thumped across the block until after 1 a.m., and church bells woke me at 7. Rolling a 50‑lb suitcase over the cobblestones from the taxi drop-off shredded the wheels, and ride-shares couldn’t pull to the door because of a street closure for a parade. If you’re coming in with luggage or trying to sleep early, the setting is more hassle than I expected.",
        "source_4": "I chose this hotel for a single night before an early flight and left more tired than I arrived. The line to check in wrapped into the lobby and moved slowly, the elevator stopped short of the floor and jolted, and the room’s AC rattled like a box fan. Water took nearly ten minutes to run warm, Wi‑Fi cut out during a video call, and housekeeping knocked at 8:30 despite a confirmed late checkout.",
        "source_5": "Only about staff and services: The concierge, Paula, sketched a self-guided history walk that hit Casa Blanca, the city wall, and a quiet overlook I wouldn’t have found alone. They stored our sail duffels after checkout, printed our boarding passes, and booked a 4:30 a.m. taxi that actually arrived at 4:25. The wake-up call came on time, and someone had coffee set out even before dawn."
