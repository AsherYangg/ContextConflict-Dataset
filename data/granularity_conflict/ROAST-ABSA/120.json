        "source_1": "I picked up this phone two weeks ago mainly for hotspot tethering on client visits. At the same desk where my old Pixel pulls 60–70 Mbps on Airtel 4G and my laptop shows ~25 ms ping, this handset sits at 4 bars but pages just spin. Speedtest fluctuates between 0.2–2 Mbps and then flatlines. I swapped SIMs, reset the APN, cleared cache, and tried the airplane‑mode toggle—data comes back for a minute and then stalls again. On the office Wi‑Fi (UniFi AC), it says “connected” but apps time out, while my teammates’ phones browse normally.",
        "source_2": "I zeroed in on connectivity before buying, and mine has been steady. On a TP‑Link Archer AX73, it latches to both 2.4 and 5 GHz without drops; a two‑hour WhatsApp call stayed clear, and Speedtest hovers around 120/30 Mbps. With Jio 5G outdoors, Zoom calls stay intact, and handoff from Wi‑Fi to mobile during my Uber rides happens without hiccups. I also ran a hotspot for my tablet and a work laptop during a train trip, and both held a session for about 90 minutes.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday device, it’s been a strong companion. The screen remains readable under noon sun, the speakers are loud enough for podcasts while cooking, and the camera handles dim restaurant shots without muddy faces. I charge in the morning and still have enough left after a 14‑hour day of Gmail, Photos backup, and an hour of maps. The fingerprint reader has been consistent, and the chassis doesn’t heat up even after a few rounds of Asphalt.",
        "source_4": "I rely on mobile data for field support, and this phone lets me down repeatedly. Outlook flips to “working offline,” Google Maps freezes with the blue dot stuck in place, and Slack huddles drop right as I start sharing logs. I tested at my apartment, the metro station, and a café I frequent—same SIM in my older Samsung pulls 40–50 Mbps instantly, while this handset shows full bars but refuses to load. I reset network settings, turned off dual‑SIM standby, disabled VoLTE, and even got a new SIM; the behavior stayed the same, which makes workdays messy.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on Wi‑Fi only: on campus (eduroam, WPA2‑Enterprise), the phone loops on “Obtaining IP address” and then falls back to LTE. My ThinkPad and iPad authenticate on the first try. At home on ACT Fiber with a Deco M4 mesh, it’s fine as long as I limit the 5 GHz channel width to 40 MHz; with 80 MHz, roaming between rooms causes brief drops that kick me out of Meet calls. Locking to 40 MHz stabilized it, so I suspect the roaming/DFS handling rather than the router or ISP."
