        "source_1": "I had Litter Pearls on Subscribe & Save in the 168 oz bag for months, and then out of nowhere my delivery switched to a smaller size. Customer service told me the big bag was “not currently available,” and suggested I set an alert. With two indoor cats, one 168 oz bag carried us through a full monthly refresh; the smaller bag has me topping off constantly and messing with my schedule. I’ve checked the listing every few days, but all I see are smaller units and the occasional third-party listing that’s priced way higher than I’m used to. The size change means more boxes on my porch and more time babysitting reorders.",
        "source_2": "Strictly on the product itself: I keep one high-sided box for a senior cat and one for a rambunctious kitten. The silica pearls handle moisture well; I stir daily and pull solids, and the room stays neutral even by day 10. Dust is minimal compared to the clumping clay I used before, and tracking is easy to manage with a textured mat. One 168 oz bag refills my main tray about two and a half times, and each fill lasts around 10–12 days with these two cats. I don’t care what size the listing says—this formula has been the easiest on my nose and on cleaning time.",
        "source_3": "For anyone hunting the big bag: I actually ordered the 168 oz size last week by switching from the mobile app to the desktop site. It showed “Ships from Amazon” with Prime, came out of the Kentucky fulfillment center, and landed on my doorstep in two days. The bag had a 2026 lot date and sealed edges intact. Not sure if it’s a regional inventory thing or a glitch in the app, but it was there on my laptop when it wasn’t showing on my phone. I bought two because I don’t want to play hide-and-seek with restocks.",
        "source_4": "My take is purely about handling and storage. The 168 oz sack is awkward—floppy, heavy, and easy to tear at the seam if you drag it out of the box. I spilled half a bag across my kitchen once and learned my lesson. The smaller jug with a screw cap is easier to control; I can top off a box with one hand and not strain my wrist. I live in a small apartment and the jugs line up neatly on a closet shelf, whereas the big bags slump and take up weird space. I know the per-ounce cost is different, but the smaller container keeps my floors cleaner and my back happier.",
        "source_5": "Overall experience after a year: the litter keeps odors in check for our two rescues, but the size shuffle has thrown off both budget and logistics. The 168 oz bag used to run me around $24.99 (roughly $0.15 per ounce); the 96 oz I’ve been forced into is about $18.99 (around $0.20 per ounce). With a full refresh every three weeks, that difference isn’t tiny by the end of the year. On top of that, the smaller size means more deliveries and more packaging to break down. If the larger bag stabilizes in stock, I’ll stick with this brand. If not, I may switch just to simplify ordering.",
        "source_6": "I tried Litter Pearls because the idea of low dust sounded great, but it didn’t mesh with my setup. The beads make a clinking sound that spooked my skittish tabby, and after week two the urine smell crept in even with daily stirring and a mat under the box. The pearls rolled out like tiny marbles onto my hardwood and showed up under the couch. I barely made it halfway through my 168 oz bag before handing it off to a neighbor and moving back to a heavier, clumping option that stays put."
