        "source_1": "I landed after a red‑eye with almost no voice, and the front desk agent noticed right away. By the time I got to my room in the Tower (9th floor, runway view), room service knocked with a kettle, ginger tea, honey, and a few shortbread biscuits without me having called. The bed and carpet looked recently cleaned, the desk had enough space for my laptop and papers, and the double‑pane windows kept things calm even though I could see planes taxiing. The covered walkway to Terminal 3 took me about five minutes at a normal pace, which made the morning connection straightforward.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on soundproofing: my Tower room on the 6th floor, facing the runway, let in a steady rumble starting around 5:10 a.m. I could pick out takeoffs and the whine of engines spooling up. Door closures along the hallway were sharp, and the housekeeping cart wheels were audible just after 7. The earplugs in the closet helped a little, but I still woke up several times.",
        "source_3": "My experience is only about service pace. I called at 8:05 p.m. for two extra pillows and a pot of herbal tea for a sore throat and was told it would be up in ten minutes. After no knock by 8:35, I rang again; the items finally arrived at 8:55 with an apology that they were short‑staffed. Earlier, the check‑in line wrapped past the ropes and took about 25 minutes, and the bell desk seemed overwhelmed with arrivals.",
        "source_4": "I’m zeroing in on the room details. Tower room 1021 had plenty of floor space for two suitcases to lie open, a firm mattress without sags, and blackout curtains that actually sealed the edges. The bathroom grout was intact, no mildew smells, and water pressure stayed strong during an evening shower. The decor skewed beige and functional—lamps with simple pull chains, a basic wooden dresser, and a glass‑top desk—nothing flashy but everything in working order.",
        "source_5": "For an overall take: arriving from an overnight flight and leaving again the next morning, the location was the draw. I walked from baggage claim to the lobby in under ten minutes and didn’t need a shuttle. The room itself felt plain—tan walls, standard armchair—but it was tidy, and the HVAC kept a steady temperature without cycling loudly. Elevators at 5 a.m. were slow enough that I waited through two full cars, and the lobby bar had closed by the time I got in at 11 p.m., so I grabbed a sandwich from a kiosk near the Skytrain instead."
