        "source_1": "I bought the phone mid-June and the included Lightning cable quit in about six weeks. It started charging only intermittently, then required a precise angle to stay connected, and the jacket near the plug split. I charge nightly from a wall adapter and twice a week in the car, no yanking or hard bends. I borrowed a spare to get through the week and ordered a braided replacement. For something bundled with a premium device, the cable felt flimsy.",
        "source_2": "After a month with the phone, the display stays readable in direct sun, apps open quickly, and the camera handles evening street shots better than my last device. Battery gets me through a 12-hour workday with maps, email, and two video calls. I used a trade-in and a seasonal discount, and what I paid lines up with what I get day to day. The included cable sits on my desk and still works, though I mostly charge wirelessly now. If someone asked me for a single do-everything phone, this is the one I’d point to.",
        "source_3": "I paid full retail at the company store and walked out with just the handset and a thin Lightning cable in the box. After taxes and device protection, the total hit my budget harder than expected, and I keep wondering whether the 128 GB storage and standard charger justify that number. My previous mid-range model cost hundreds less and came with a power brick and earbuds. The phone runs fine, but I don’t feel the extras or finish set it far enough apart to warrant that spend. If I hadn’t needed the camera for work, I probably would have waited for a sale.",
        "source_4": "I’m rough on phones—pockets with keys, gym bag drops, and a couple of sidewalk slips—and this one has held up better than any I’ve owned. The frame hasn’t nicked, and the screen survived a waist-high fall with only a tiny scuff on the edge of my case. Buttons remain clicky, speakers clear, and there’s no rattle or flex when I squeeze it. I paid more than I usually do, but the feel and finish come across like a high-end tool rather than a fashion piece. That’s the kind of build that makes the spend make sense to me.",
        "source_5": "I stick to the bundled Lightning cable at my desk and in the car, swapping it between a 20W wall brick and a compact adapter twice a day. Five months in, the connector is still tight and the outer jacket hasn’t frayed; it charges reliably even with a thick case on the phone. I run the battery down to about 20 percent most nights and top up before bed. I bought a spare just in case, but the original is doing the job without fuss. Maybe I got a better batch, because my last phone’s cable failed in three weeks."
