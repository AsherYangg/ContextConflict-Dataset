        "source_1": "I stopped by the front desk at Hotel Rex around 7 a.m. to ask the best way to reach Lands End without rideshare. The clerk circled a bus line on a map and assured me it ran early and skipped a transfer; it didn’t. I waited 25 minutes for a route that never came, then hoofed it ten blocks to catch a different line. Later, when I asked about the Ferry Building farmers’ market hours, I was told Saturday, but I arrived to a much smaller setup because the big market day was actually a different morning.",
        "source_2": "I spent three nights at Hotel Rex and felt the whole stay was smooth. Check-in at about 9:30 p.m. took five minutes, my king room on the sixth floor had good blackout curtains, and the hallway stayed quiet. I liked grabbing coffee in the book-filled lobby before heading out, and the staff sketched a couple of walking routes that helped me avoid the steepest hills. I’m already penciling in another visit next spring.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on the noise from my room. Mine faced Sutter Street above a lively bar, and the bass carried up until around 1 a.m. The in-room AC added a steady rattle, so even with the window closed, it wasn’t the easiest night. The front desk offered earplugs and a next-day room change, but I had a dawn flight and decided not to repack, so I rode it out.",
        "source_4": "My experience was mostly about service. The concierge at Hotel Rex hand-drew a route from Union Square through Chinatown to North Beach with cafe stops, secured a last-minute table at an Italian place that normally has a waitlist, and found me a timed entry for the de Young when the app showed sold out. When my stroller latch jammed, the bellman brought a small toolkit and had it working again in under five minutes.",
        "source_5": "Stepping back to the overall picture, the literary-themed lobby and quiet reading nooks were a nice touch, but my weeklong stay tangled me in a few snags: two authorization holds lingered on my card after checkout, the Wi‑Fi cut out every ten minutes during Zoom, and the single elevator stalled twice, which meant long waits with a suitcase. The staff checked in on me and apologized, yet I headed home more worn out than I’d hoped.",
        "source_6": "I tend to judge places by whether I’d recommend them and return. After a weekend at Hotel Rex, I put it on my shortlist for work trips and told my sister to book it for her anniversary—partly because the team remembered our names and had restaurant ideas ready without prompting. I’m planning another stay when the spring conferences roll around."
