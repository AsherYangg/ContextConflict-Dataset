        "source_1": "I focus on the filling, and the classic bag nails the ratio for me: the chocolate layer sits about credit-card thick between two light wafers, so each bite has a clean snap without smearing. I can split one cookie in half and see an even stripe end to end, not a lopsided blob. Left on my desk around 72°F, the chocolate stays firm enough that it doesn’t smudge my fingers, and the flavor reads as cocoa-forward rather than sugary.",
        "source_2": "As an overall pick for my afternoon coffee, these are the ones I keep clipped shut in the paper sleeve with the plastic tray. The batch I grabbed last week was consistent—uniform size, intact edges, and a gentle vanilla aroma when you open the bag. A couple of cookies with a cappuccino hits the spot, and the bag disappears at my office within a day because people just keep wandering over to the break room to snag one.",
        "source_3": "I’ve run through a handful of variations—mint, double chocolate, and a fall seasonal—and I keep circling back to the classic. The mint oil felt sharp next to the delicate cookie, the double chocolate pushed the filling into heavy territory, and the seasonal spice muddied the simple butter-and-cocoa profile I like. When friends come over, the plain bag empties first while the flavored ones sit half-full.",
        "source_4": "I’m the opposite on flavors: the variety pack has been a hit in my house. Dark chocolate gives a deeper cocoa note, mint leaves a cool finish that pairs well with iced coffee, and raspberry adds a bright edge that cuts through the buttery cookie. When I set out a platter for game night, the flavored rows vanish before anyone reaches for the classics, which tells me the twists land well with a crowd.",
        "source_5": "After hearing so much buzz, I ordered two bags this month and came away underwhelmed. Several cookies arrived with crumbled rims, and the chocolate layer in my bags looked thin and a little waxy, so the wafers dominated. Dunking in hot tea turned them soggy in seconds, and the sweetness built quickly enough that I stopped after one. My niece took a bite and opted for a homemade shortbread instead.",
        "source_6": "Zooming in on just the filling: in my last purchase the ratio felt off. Some cookies had a scant smear while others had a thick ridge that oozed at room temp, so a few bites were dry and others left a coat on the tongue. The uneven spread made the texture unpredictable, and the paper sleeve shed crumbs because the wafers broke where the blob of chocolate pushed against the tray."
