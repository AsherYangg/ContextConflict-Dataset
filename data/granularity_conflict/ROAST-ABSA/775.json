        "source_1": "I booked this place for the location alone and it delivered. I stepped out the front door and was on the top stretch of La Rambla within a minute; Plaça de Catalunya was a short stroll for the airport bus, and the Gothic Quarter started just across the street. I caught an early coffee at La Boqueria, walked to the waterfront by lunchtime, and grabbed a metro at Catalunya for an evening trip to Gràcia. Taxis were easy to hail at the plaza, so getting around never felt like a hassle.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about cleanliness, so I did a quick inspection of the room when I arrived. The bed linens were fresh, but I found a stray hair in the sink and a faint smudge on the bathroom mirror, and there was light dust under the desk when I ran a tissue along the edge. Housekeeping brought new towels right away when I called, yet the initial once-over didn’t scream freshly detailed. For a one-night stay it was fine, but it didn’t match the “pristine” expectations I had going in.",
        "source_3": "I stayed one night after a late flight into BCN, checked in around 11 p.m., and the front desk got me sorted quickly with a key and a city map. My room faced an interior courtyard, so despite being just off La Rambla it was quiet enough to sleep; the bed was firm and the shower had strong water pressure in the morning. I paid €120 for a Saturday, which felt reasonable given the location and how tight availability was in the area. I left my bag with them after checkout and spent the afternoon wandering the old town before grabbing it for the airport bus—very easy experience start to finish.",
        "source_4": "I interacted with staff several times: the morning receptionist circled sightseeing spots on a paper map and booked me a timed entry for Sagrada Familia, then printed the confirmation without charging for the printout. Later that night, I called down about a noisy hallway and the phone rang through twice before someone answered, and it took another 15 minutes before the noise tapered off. The bar attendant at the lobby kiosk gave me directions to El Born with a couple of restaurant tips, which were spot on. Overall, helpful when you’re face-to-face, less responsive by phone.",
        "source_5": "I focused on the price because I was traveling on a tight budget. Booking last minute during a festival weekend ran me €190 for a standard room, no breakfast included; it felt like most of that ticket was for the address right at the top of La Rambla. Wi‑Fi and luggage storage were included, but the buffet was an extra €12 and coffee from the lobby machine wasn’t cheap. If you’re coming outside peak dates you might snag a better rate, yet my particular night didn’t feel like a bargain.",
        "source_6": "My lens is the room itself. The sheets were crisp, the bathroom smelled freshly cleaned, and the chrome fixtures had that just-polished shine. I slid my finger along the windowsill and wardrobe shelf—no dust, and the floor edges around the bed were tidy. Even the remote and light switches looked wiped down, which is where hotels often cut corners. For a quick stay, the space felt well maintained."
