        "source_1": "I booked a corner suite at Embassy Suites Reforma for a long weekend and came away talking about the whole experience. Check-in was smooth even though we arrived before noon, the front desk sent a text when the room was ready, and we were upstairs with a view of the Ángel de la Independencia by 1 p.m. The suite had a separate living area with a big work desk, and the evening reception downstairs made it easy to grab a bite before heading out. I walked to the Museo de Arte Moderno in about 15 minutes and felt comfortable getting around at night along Paseo de la Reforma. Breakfast had a made-to-order omelet station and fresh fruit that actually tasted ripe, and the bell staff kept flagging taxis within minutes whenever we needed to hop to Roma or Condesa.",
        "source_2": "I only care about location, and this place sits exactly where I needed to be. From the lobby, I could stroll to the Ángel in under five minutes, and the Sevilla metro stop was a straight shot—maybe a 7–8 minute walk. My morning run along Reforma was perfect because the sidewalks are broad and shaded, and on Sunday the ciclovía closed lanes to cars so I could bike all the way toward Chapultepec. The tradeoff is that sirens and occasional demonstrations on the boulevard drifted up to my 12th-floor room until late evening, so anyone craving total quiet should plan for that. For meetings in Zona Rosa and quick airport rides (25–35 minutes by Uber with moderate traffic), the location did the job without any zigzag detours.",
        "source_3": "I’m picky about sleep, so here’s just my take on room comfort. In 1107, the mattress felt stiff with a slight dip on one side, and the pillows were thick but oddly lumpy. The A/C compressor kicked in with a rattle every half hour, which kept me glancing at the clock around 3 a.m., and the blackout curtains leaked a bright stripe of morning light right at eye level. Water pressure in the shower fluctuated between strong and gentle within the same rinse, and the fan never cleared steam quickly, so the mirror stayed fogged while I was trying to shave. None of this ruined the trip, but if I were booking again I’d ask for a room away from the boulevard and test the bed before settling in.",
        "source_4": "I traveled with my mother, who uses a cane, so I interacted with the staff constantly and they made things easy. The concierge, Luis, arranged a wheelchair for our museum visits and printed timed-entry tickets so we could skip lines. A bellman named Karla (yes, on the bell team) noticed we were juggling meds and brought up extra bottled water and an ice bucket without being asked. Housekeeping swapped a finicky electric kettle within ten minutes, and when my mother misplaced her scarf in the lobby, the night manager checked cameras and had it back to us before we went to breakfast. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for a taxi, and they always confirmed the destination in Spanish and English to avoid mix-ups.",
        "source_5": "As an overall stay, mine leaned more hassle than I expected. I arrived at 3 p.m. to a check-in line snaking into the bar area, and it took about 40 minutes to reach the desk. Only two elevators seemed to be in service, so getting to the 14th floor meant waits that stretched to ten minutes during peak times. The breakfast room turned into a maze around 8:30 a.m., with open tables but no clean place settings, and I ended up balancing a plate on my lap in the lobby. Wi‑Fi bounced me off repeatedly during a video call, forcing me to connect through my phone’s hotspot. The suite itself was large and had a nice city view, but the day-to-day rhythm of moving around the hotel felt clunky.",
        "source_6": "I’m focusing purely on room size and layout because I needed space to work. The suite had a proper living room with a full sofa, a large L‑shaped desk that fit my 16‑inch laptop and a travel monitor, and enough outlets that I didn’t need my power strip. The bedroom could be closed off with a door, which helped for early calls, and there were two closets—one holding the safe and iron, the other tall enough for a garment bag. The bathroom counter ran the length of the wall, so toiletries didn’t pile up, and there was room to leave a roller bag open without tripping over it. The only quirk was the TV placement: the one in the bedroom was offset from the bed, so I ended up watching from the sofa, which wasn’t a big deal given all the extra space."
