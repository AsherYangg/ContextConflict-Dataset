        "source_1": "I booked one night before a cruise and arrived around 11:30 p.m. The front desk agent, Mozah, checked us in quickly and moved us to a room near the elevators after noticing my spouse had a knee brace. No extra charge was mentioned, and the walk-in shower made the morning a lot easier. The suite smelled fresh and the counters and bathroom looked newly wiped down. We slept without hallway noise and the blackout curtains actually blocked the lot lights. In the morning we walked about 8–10 minutes to a grocery and grabbed coffee next door, then took a Lyft to the port in under 10 minutes. For a quick stopover, it worked exactly as needed.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on housekeeping because that’s what stood out during my one-night stay. The nightstand had a ring of dust you could circle with a finger, and the vent above the bed had gray lint hanging from it. In the bathroom, there were two long hairs on the shower wall and a faint soap scum line along the glass. The kitchenette counter felt tacky until I wiped it with one of my own disinfecting wipes, which turned brown on the first pass. I called downstairs and was told the cleaning team had left for the day but could return in the morning, which didn’t help since I checked out at 7 a.m. The bed linens looked fine, but the corners near the floor had crumbs.",
        "source_3": "I chose this place because it’s advertised as near everything, but without a car the area felt tricky. The sidewalk out front ends halfway down the block, and crossing the six-lane road to get to the pharmacy felt dicey with luggage. Google Maps said 12 minutes to restaurants, but with stoplights and no crosswalk on one corner, it took us closer to 25. The bus to downtown required a transfer and ran infrequently after 9 p.m. Rideshare to the cruise terminal was 18–22 minutes depending on traffic and surged during embarkation hours. Quiet at night, yes, but not the kind of location where you can pop out quickly for a bite.",
        "source_4": "I interacted only with one team member, a young man named Mozah, and that single interaction shaped the stay. We rolled in at 1 a.m. after a delayed flight, and he had us assigned and keyed in under five minutes. He noticed my hinged knee brace and switched us to a room near the elevator with a low-threshold shower, then brought up extra towels and an ice pack without being asked. He walked us through the Wi‑Fi and printed directions to the nearest pharmacy in case we needed more wrap. I can’t speak to housekeeping or breakfast because we left early, but that check-in alone lowered my stress level by a lot.",
        "source_5": "I booked because the nightly rate looked friendly, but the final bill told a different story. Parking was $25 plus tax, there was a nightly destination fee I hadn’t spotted on the booking page, and an incidental hold of $100 took five business days to clear. Coffee in the lobby was complimentary only in the morning window, and there was no breakfast included, so two granola bars and a bottled water from the market came to $14. The room itself was fine for a short stay and the bed was comfortable enough, but once I added rideshare to dinner and back, this stop cost more than a downtown option I had also considered. If you’re evaluating price, make sure to factor in the extras."
