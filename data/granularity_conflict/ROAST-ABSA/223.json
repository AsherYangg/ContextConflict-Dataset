        "source_1": "My partner surprised me with a December weekend in NYC, and this place ended up being part of the fun. We were assigned a corner king on the 31st floor, and the floor-to-ceiling glass turned the skyline into a live painting. The room felt generous for Manhattan, spotless, and the bed knocked us out after long walks through the markets. Elevators moved quickly even during the morning rush; we never waited more than a minute. The big TV pivoted toward the bed, perfect for a late movie. Staff stood out: the doorman hustled out with umbrellas during a downpour, and the front desk circled nearby coffee spots on a paper map like a local. I left with a bunch of photos and a plan to come back when it’s warmer.",
        "source_2": "Three-night stay in room 1216, and I’m sticking to the bed. The mattress sloped toward the middle, which meant my partner and I kept sliding into the same spot no matter how we arranged the pillows. I sleep on my side and could feel a firmer ridge near the foot that left my hip sore each morning. The pillows were uniformly high; I ended up rolling a towel to get the height down. Linens were clean, but the support wasn’t there—flattened corners and that center dip made it tough to get decent rest.",
        "source_3": "I’m a business traveler who unwinds with sports and streaming, so the in-room TV matters to me. The flat screen looked new, but HDMI inputs were disabled and casting wasn’t available, so I couldn’t hook up my laptop or phone. The channel lineup skipped the regional sports network I follow, and the remote lagged a second or two between button presses. When the HVAC fan kicked on, the volume ceiling felt low, which made dialogue hard to catch. The picture quality was crisp, but the limitations made the setup feel more like a display than something I could actually use.",
        "source_4": "Arrived at 10:20 p.m. after a delayed flight and ran into a string of service hiccups. My key cards failed twice, which meant two elevator rides back to the desk before I could even open the door. I requested an extra duvet at 10:30; it showed up at 11:40 after two follow-up calls. The 6:30 wake-up didn’t ring, and housekeeping knocked at 8:05 despite the do-not-disturb sign. At checkout, there were minibar charges I didn’t incur, and getting them removed added another ten minutes. Nothing dramatic on its own, but the accumulation made the stay feel more hectic than restful.",
        "source_5": "Spent two nights on the 10th floor facing a busy avenue. The location was spot on for walking to a matinee and catching the A train, and our room had a narrow slice of river view. Still, the windows let in honking and sirens late into the night, and the glass had streaks from a recent storm that made the view look dull in photos. Morning elevator traffic was heavy—I waited through three full cars around 8:30 before squeezing in. The bed felt cushy and the shower pressure was solid, but between the street noise and elevator queues I left more tired than I arrived, so I’ll pick a different spot next trip."
