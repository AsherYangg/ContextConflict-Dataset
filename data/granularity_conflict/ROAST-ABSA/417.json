        "source_1": "I ordered Chocolate Chex through Amazon because the shelf at my QFC was empty, but the math didn’t work in my favor. The 4‑pack here came to about 41–43 cents per ounce after a small Subscribe & Save discount, while my store’s sale price hits 25–30 cents per ounce pretty regularly. Even factoring gas and time, the per‑box total on Amazon still ended up a couple dollars higher for me this month.",
        "source_2": "Zeroing in on the cereal itself: the chocolate coating feels like a light cocoa dusting rather than a deep flavor, and the squares soften quickly in milk. I had a bowl at 7 a.m. and was rummaging for a second breakfast by 9. My two kids left half their bowls and asked for plain Cheerios instead, so the rest of the box got turned into snack mix.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, this has become our “treat” cereal that still works on busy mornings. One bowl holds me through a long stretch of meetings, and a small baggie in my backpack gets me through the afternoon slump. The kids ask for a small handful after school, so the box doesn’t just sit in the pantry. When Amazon’s price dips below what our Safeway charges, I grab a couple to avoid a store run.",
        "source_4": "After finishing two boxes, I decided it’s not a repeat buy for our house. The chocolate note leans a bit artificial to my palate, and it leaves the milk with a powdery aftertaste. My kids nibbled a few pieces as a snack but didn’t go back for more, and the pieces shattered when I tried mixing them into a trail mix, so there were lots of crumbs.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on Amazon’s pricing: with five items in my Subscribe & Save order, I hit the 15% tier and stacked a clipped coupon, which brought each 13–14 oz box to roughly $3.05 delivered. Our Giant lists the same size at $4.29 before tax. I set a price alert and reorder when it drops into that low‑$3 range, which beats my local store even on their promotions."
