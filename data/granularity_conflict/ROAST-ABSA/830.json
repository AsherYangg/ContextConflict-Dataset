        "source_1": "I took the equine reproduction course as a recreational rider who helps manage a small pasture. Over five weeks on Coursera, Chris Mortensen walked through anatomy, behavior, and breeding management using short 10–15 minute lectures and clear diagrams of the mare reproductive tract. The case examples—like tracking teasing results across a cycle—made it easier to connect lectures with practical decisions. I printed the slide PDFs, kept notes on estrus indicators, and did the quick end-of-module quizzes plus a peer reflection. The scope felt like a broad introduction, and I could comfortably fit two modules into a Sunday evening.",
        "source_2": "I rely heavily on captions, so I focused on the subtitles throughout the course. In Week 3 around 12:47, “estrus” was repeatedly transcribed as “extras,” and later in the same lecture “foaling” appeared as “falling,” which threw off my notes. I also saw “stud” rendered as “stood” during the breeding management video, and several anatomical terms were inconsistently spelled between lectures (“ovulation fossa” in one video, “ovulation fosse” in another). On mobile, the English captions occasionally lagged a couple of seconds behind the audio, especially in the barn footage segments, which made it hard to follow the sequence of steps being described.",
        "source_3": "I focused on the assessments because I like structured checks. The Week 2 quiz had a “select all that apply” item where the instruction was only visible after scrolling, and I missed it on the first attempt. Two questions used double negatives (“Which is not uncommon to be absent…”) that were easy to misread, and one item referenced an example from the next lecture in the sequence, so the answer wasn’t clear unless you’d already advanced. After my second attempt, my score changed about an hour later without a notification, which made tracking progress confusing. The content matched the lectures, but the phrasing and timing created avoidable hurdles.",
        "source_4": "As a horse owner who already follows breeding seasons at a local farm, I used the course to tighten up my record-keeping. The instructor drew on fieldwork and research, showing barn-side footage and linking to papers on reproductive cycles. I set up a log for teasing responses and body condition after the Week 1 module, and the discussion forum added practical tips from other learners about managing light exposure. I’d enroll in a follow-up module focused on foaling complications and postpartum care; the current series stops at breeding management with only brief pointers to what comes next.",
        "source_5": "I watched everything on the Coursera app during my commute and noticed the course’s “programming” in terms of platform behavior more than content. Modules unlocked Tuesday mornings, but the “Mark as complete” state didn’t sync between my phone and laptop, so I re-watched parts to find where I left off. Offline download occasionally cached the slides but not the videos, and the web player skipped back a few seconds after pausing, which made note-taking awkward. The quiz timer behaved differently in the app versus the browser—no countdown on mobile—so I switched devices mid-week to finish an assessment. Support articles suggested clearing cache, which helped once, but the inconsistency persisted across Weeks 2 and 4.",
        "source_6": "I’m a veterinary student looking for deeper reproductive physiology, and I approached this as a prep for clinical rotations. The lectures covered cycle terminology, basic anatomy, and management decisions, but didn’t dig into endocrine pathways, ultrasound metrics for follicular monitoring, or sample handling protocols. Several slides repeated definitions between weeks instead of building toward diagnostic decision trees, and the final project was an optional reflection rather than a case analysis. For someone new to equids, the overview sets a foundation; for specialized training, I’ll need material that gets into hormone assays, imaging criteria, and intervention planning."
