        "source_1": "I mainly care about how the lectures look and sound, so I watched the first two weeks straight through without doing the assignments. The videos stream at a consistent resolution with clean audio, and the animations track the instructor’s pointer as concepts unfold step by step. Captions line up well with the narration, and slide text stays readable even on a phone. I liked that segments are kept around 8–12 minutes, which makes it easy to rewatch tricky parts. Offline downloads on the Coursera app didn’t stutter, and the chapter markers helped me jump to diagrams I wanted to revisit.",
        "source_2": "From the first week, the syllabus promised a foundations overview, but the lectures jumped into terminology without an orientation or a glossary link. Module 2 repeated topics from Module 1 with different titles, and a couple of readings pointed to resources that returned 404s. One assignment referenced a dataset that wasn’t included in the downloads, and I had to dig through the discussion board to find a mirror. The course calendar listed a live Q&A that never happened, and announcements about due dates were posted after the deadlines had already passed. By the final week, there was no wrap-up or guidance on what to tackle next.",
        "source_3": "What stood out to me was the structure and hands-on work. Each week layered a case study onto the previous one, and the graded project rubrics spelled out expectations with examples of acceptable outputs. The auto-grader flagged my mistakes with targeted hints, so I could correct an evaluation metric without guessing in the dark. The labs provided clean starter notebooks and small datasets, and office hours included timestamped recordings with answers to common pitfalls. By the end, I had stitched together a simple pipeline that I could replicate with my own data.",
        "source_4": "I went in hoping for something that would either teach basics from the ground up or push into advanced territory, and it didn’t settle firmly in either lane. The animated slides lean heavily on buzzwords, and when I asked beginner-level questions in the forum, replies were sparse or came days later. A few lessons teased topics like regularization and deployment, then pivoted back to definitions without showing a complete workflow. The exercises felt more like fill-in-the-blanks than problem-solving, and several examples showed the same dataset across multiple weeks without adding new angles. After finishing, I was still unsure what prerequisites I should have covered and what deeper material I should explore next.",
        "source_5": "I took the course alongside a busy work schedule and appreciated how the outline breaks material into small, manageable segments. The progression from terminology to hands-on notebooks is steady, and weekly quizzes check whether you caught details from the videos. Peer feedback on the capstone was constructive, and mentors in the discussion board nudged me toward better evaluation practices. The notebooks ran cleanly in the Coursera environment, so I didn’t fight with local setup. By the time I submitted the final project, I felt ready to apply the techniques to a small internal dataset."
