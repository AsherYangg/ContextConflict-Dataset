        "source_1": "I enrolled as a Python dev stepping into Java. The syllabus jumps into using libraries in week one: I pulled JSON with Gson and parsed CSV with Apache Commons instead of doing only println drills. I built a small console app that queried a public API and formatted the response. It took me about three evenings to finish the course. Grading relies on module quizzes tied closely to the assignments; there’s no peer review or TA comments, so I ended up iterating until the quiz accepted my output.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the programming assignments: each task came with a skeleton and sample inputs, and the checks were strict about exact strings. Week two’s job (fetching JSON and printing selected fields) took me 45 minutes. The file-processing exercise was mostly wiring up methods the template already outlined. I never had to deal with edge cases like malformed lines or flaky network calls, so I wrapped up each week quickly.",
        "source_3": "Speaking solely about the assignments, I didn’t breeze through them. The final project combined Jsoup scraping with Gson serialization, and the autograder failed unless my method signatures and spacing matched exactly. I spent two evenings hunting a stray newline and fixing UTF-8 encoding so the characters matched the expected output. For someone new to Java tooling, that kind of fiddly debugging ate a lot of time.",
        "source_4": "On the grading format: I actually prefer not having peer review. In previous courses I waited days for random feedback; here I could submit code, run the linked quiz, and get results in seconds. That fast loop let me finish two modules on a long flight, without waiting for anyone to grade my work.",
        "source_5": "The quizzes are tightly coupled to the code. Several questions literally ask for values produced by your program, so you can’t move on unless your output matches the grader’s format precisely. I had a correct algorithm but failed a question because my JSON fields printed in a different order than the hidden test expected. With no partial credit, one formatting mismatch blocked the whole module.",
        "source_6": "As someone with a few years in C#, I took this to get comfortable with Java syntax. The lectures are short, and right away we import libraries instead of only doing text input/output, which changes the pace. But the entire grade comes from auto-graded quizzes, there’s no peer review or code critique, and the projects felt like small, disconnected scripts rather than a cohesive build. I wrapped it up over a weekend and moved on."
