        "source_1": "I stayed three nights for a conference and checked in close to 11 pm. My room on the 24th floor had floor-to-ceiling windows facing the bay, a desk with plenty of outlets and USB ports, and strong Wi‑Fi for late calls. It was an easy 8-minute walk to the Downtown MRT and getting a taxi at the curb never took more than a couple of minutes. I’d book the same place for my next work trip to Singapore.",
        "source_2": "I care mainly about breakfast. On Monday at 7:30 am, the buffet area was jammed. A line snaked past the pastry case, the clatter of plates made it hard to hear the server, and finding a seat took 15 minutes. The omelet station stopped taking orders while trying to catch up, and the coffee machines blinked “out of beans” twice. I ended up eating standing near the juice bar so I wouldn’t miss my morning call.",
        "source_3": "All I can comment on is the room. Corner king, 2307, with a harbor-facing window wall. Blackout curtains sealed well, the AC held 22°C without cycling, and the work chair didn’t wobble. At dawn, the sun lit the ships like tiny lanterns—worth getting up early just to watch.",
        "source_4": "As an overall stay, the mornings set the tone. Between tour groups queuing around 7–8 am and the din rolling up from the buffet into the lobby, prepping for client meetings felt like working in a food court. By day two I skipped the prepaid breakfast and went to a cafe across the street, which made the package feel poorly chosen for a business schedule.",
        "source_5": "I picked it for location only: two blocks to the Downtown line, about 12–15 minutes on foot to Marina Bay offices, and a quick 18 SGD Grab to Suntec. The riverside path felt safe at night, and there’s a hawker center with late hours opposite the back entrance, so getting meals between meetings was easy.",
        "source_6": "If you plan around the rush, the breakfast routine is fine. I went down after 9:30 am each day and got a table immediately by the window. Staff were clearing plates quickly, the fruit trays stayed stocked, and I had time to read emails without interruptions. A colleague who tried at 7:45 had a different experience, so timing matters."
