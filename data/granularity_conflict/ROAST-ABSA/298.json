        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the instructor. The way he unpacked the product rule and implicit differentiation in Week 2, writing each step on the tablet, helped me track the logic without rewinding much. During a live Q&A, he worked through an optimization problem submitted by a learner and posted a short write‑up the next day. I mostly ignored the peer forums and just followed his lecture path and the embedded checkpoints.",
        "source_2": "I came in with only high‑school algebra and thought I’d be fine, but the first graded set already expected comfort with limits and basic differential equations. By Week 3 we were juggling Jacobians and Taylor expansions with almost no review, so I kept pausing to read external notes. The description suggests an introductory background is enough; in practice I needed more than that to keep pace.",
        "source_3": "From an overall perspective, the six‑week structure worked for me. Each week had 6–8 short videos, a quiz, and a small coding task (using NumPy to verify gradients on a toy recommender). The pacing fit into my evenings, and the progression from single‑variable refreshers to multivariable applications felt steady. I finished all deadlines in the first session and added the certificate to my profile.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, the flow felt uneven. Week 1 spends a lot of time on platform walkthroughs, then Week 2 jumps into multivariable notation with little bridge. Several quizzes drill symbol minutiae rather than problem solving, and the auto‑grader rejected equivalent answers because of formatting (I lost points for writing vectors as rows instead of columns). The discussion board was quiet enough that my questions sat for days without a reply.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on notation explanations: there are dedicated segments on nabla, Jacobian vs. Hessian, and index conventions. On the slides, subscripts are small and sometimes the symbol choices shift between lectures and problem sets (J vs. Df), so I kept a personal legend to stay consistent. The examples that did stick for me were the ones where he annotated a contour plot while taking partial derivatives step by step."
