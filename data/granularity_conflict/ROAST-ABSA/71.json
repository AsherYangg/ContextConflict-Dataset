        "source_1": "I booked the Flower of St. Charles on a whim during a Fox River weekend, having never heard of it. Walking in, the lobby’s high ceilings, fresh flowers, and warm lighting immediately put me at ease. Check-in took under five minutes, and my room (421) looked recently refreshed with crisp linens, blackout curtains, and a whisper-quiet AC. I grabbed coffee from the lobby in the morning and read by the window before heading out. If I’m back in town, this is where I’d choose again.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the bathroom: in room 312 the water never got beyond lukewarm, even after running the shower and sink for five minutes at 6:45 a.m. on both Saturday and Sunday. I tried later in the day as well and saw only a slight improvement. Maintenance mentioned the boiler was cycling; they offered to switch me, but the second room felt the same. I ended up boiling water in the in-room kettle to shave.",
        "source_3": "I only want to talk about the personnel. When my rideshare canceled, the front desk printed a map, called a local cab, and suggested a walking route along the river with a couple of dinner spots marked. They held my bag after checkout and texted when the room was ready early. Housekeeping noticed my fraying phone cable and left a spare with a handwritten note. Those little touches made logistics effortless.",
        "source_4": "I spent two hours in the lobby waiting for colleagues and could’ve stayed longer. Plush armchairs, a gas fireplace, and big windows gave it a living-room feel, and there were bowls of citrus water beside a tray of cookies in the afternoon. Soft jazz played at a level you can talk over, and the fresh flowers near the staircase added a nice scent. It’s the kind of space where you actually want to linger.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: the property looks sharp and the team works smoothly—easy check-in, clean hallways, quiet nights—but my stay kept circling back to the tepid water. After an early run along Main Street, I wanted a hot shower and got a lukewarm one both mornings, even after letting it run. The room itself was comfortable, with plenty of outlets and a solid desk, and the lobby felt like a calm retreat. Still, starting the day without a proper hot shower threw off the experience enough that I’d think twice before booking in winter."
