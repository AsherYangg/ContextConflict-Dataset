        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for navigation and podcasts, so battery life was my first check. With 5G on, auto-brightness hovering around 50–60%, and Google Maps plus Spotify running during my 90‑minute commute both ways, I’m ending most days around 20–30%. Screen-on time sits near 6–7 hours for me. Overnight it loses about 2–3% on Wi‑Fi. I charge every other evening with the included adapter; a 30‑minute top-up at lunch takes me from roughly 35% to around 65%, which comfortably gets me through meetings and an evening gym session.",
        "source_2": "I focus a lot on audio because I take calls in noisy places. The earpiece is crisp enough that I can hear colleagues at a busy farmer’s market, and callers say I don’t sound muffled. The bottom speaker gets loud—while cooking with the exhaust fan on, I keep media volume at about 60% and can still hear podcasts clearly across the kitchen. The ringtone woke me up from the next room at 7 a.m., and Bluetooth volume in my Honda’s stock stereo doesn’t require maxing out the knob like my previous phone did.",
        "source_3": "I was worried about weird prompts, but in three weeks I’ve only seen a “press power button” message once right after enabling the emergency SOS shortcut; turning that off made it disappear. Day to day, I run Slack, Outlook, Chrome with 10+ tabs, and Instagram, and hop between them without hiccups. I’ve had exactly one brief stutter while installing a large game update; otherwise the 90 Hz scrolling stays smooth and I haven’t needed to force-restart. System updates applied cleanly and app permissions behave predictably.",
        "source_4": "After a month, I’m dealing with constant lockups during simple tasks like opening the camera from the lock screen. The phone will freeze for 10–15 seconds, then either recover or throw me back to the home screen. A strange “press power button” warning pops up randomly while I’m not touching anything, even when I’m just reading an article. Battery falls from 80% to under 40% in a few hours of light browsing and WhatsApp, and the speaker struggles in a quiet office—notification chimes are easy to miss unless the phone is right next to me.",
        "source_5": "Using it as my work device, I carry two SIMs, handle conference calls, and keep Teams, Calendar, and a CRM app open all day. The chassis feels sturdy in hand, and the buttons have a firm click; no rattle when I shake it. I haven’t seen odd pop-ups or crashes during screen shares, and calls stay connected on my commute tunnels where my old phone used to drop. Battery gets me through a 12‑hour shift with a late-afternoon charge, and the haptics are consistent—no missed taps when typing fast.",
        "source_6": "Build quality was my main concern because I travel a lot. The frame doesn’t flex, the back panel sits flush with no creaks when pressed, and the SIM tray seals evenly. I dropped it from pocket height onto tile at the airport check-in (corner hit); the case scuffed, but the screen and buttons were unaffected. The power and volume keys are aligned and responsive with a defined click, and the USB‑C port holds the cable snugly without wiggle. After two months in and out of a backpack, there’s no discoloration or loose seams."
