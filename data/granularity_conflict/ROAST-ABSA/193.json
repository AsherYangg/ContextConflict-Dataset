        "source_1": "I had to laugh at how cautious my husky was with the first piece—full sniff inspection, a lick, then a tiny nibble. Five minutes later he was shadowing me around the kitchen looking for the bag. Now, the second he hears that crinkle, he parks himself in a perfect sit and strings drool like pearls. I keep the bag in a lidded bin because he’s learned to open the cabinet. For training, I break each strip into smaller bits and his focus is laser-sharp the whole session.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on cost: the price per ounce is higher than the supermarket biscuits I usually grab, and the bag disappears fast with two medium dogs. I’ve started counting out pieces so a training day doesn’t blow through half the bag, and I’ve skipped reordering during months when I’m tightening the grocery budget. If they offered a larger economy size or a multi-bag bundle with a better per-ounce rate, I’d restock more often.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about affordability from another angle: with autoship and the occasional coupon, my total lands close to what I pay at the local boutique for single-ingredient treats. I portion them out into a mason jar so they last the week, and the math doesn’t sting as much when I compare it to what I’d spend on chews from the farmer’s market. For me, timing purchases around sales keeps it squarely in the “reasonable splurge” category.",
        "source_4": "I’ve got a picky senior terrier who usually treats new snacks like they’re suspicious mail. First offering took a moment—nose buried in the piece, a few sniffs—then he gobbled it and came back to nudge my knee. Now he waits by the pantry after dinner and I can even hide his thyroid pill inside a chunk without drama. When the bag hits the counter, he starts doing little taps with his front paws and leaves a damp spot on the floor from drooling.",
        "source_5": "Overall take from my household: my beagle sniffed and walked away the first two times, and even warmed up pieces in my hand didn’t entice him much. He eventually munched one, but there was no excitement after that—no hovering when the bag rustled, no extra attention during training. I ended up passing the bag to my neighbor; her lab polished off a handful on the spot, so clearly it works for some dogs, just not mine."
