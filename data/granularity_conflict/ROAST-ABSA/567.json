        "source_1": "I stayed four nights for an anniversary trip and paid attention to the basics: the lobby and hallways had a fresh smell, our room was ready when we arrived, and we could walk to the art museum in about 12 minutes and the riverfront in around 8. The front desk printed a walking map and pointed out a quieter route back at night. Housekeeping swapped out towels and tidied while we were at brunch. Breakfast set out steel-cut oats, croissants, and a coffee station that never seemed empty.",
        "source_2": "I chose this place because the map made it look central, but getting around on foot turned into longer hauls than expected. The historic district was a 25-minute uphill walk with several blocks of torn-up sidewalks and detours around construction fencing. Pushing a stroller meant waiting through multiple long lights to cross a six-lane road. After dark, the route felt empty, so we used rideshare back each night. The nearest subway entrance had a “closed for maintenance” sign all weekend.",
        "source_3": "My focus was on how the staff handled a busy afternoon arrival. I got in at 3:05 pm and the check-in line stretched past the lounge; it took a little over 20 minutes to reach the counter. The key card failed twice, sending me back down in my socks after I’d started unpacking; the clerk re-encoded it and it finally worked. The concierge recommended a bistro that turned out to be booked for a private event, so we wandered until we found a spot. The night manager offered bottled water and said they’d update the dining list.",
        "source_4": "I pay close attention to room cleanliness because of allergies. When I set my bag down, I noticed water spots on the bathroom mirror and two short strands of hair in the sink. There was a fine layer of dust along the vent, and when I slid the nightstand to reach the outlet, an old receipt and crumbs were tucked underneath. I called housekeeping, and the next day they did a thorough sweep and replaced the bath mat and trash liner.",
        "source_5": "I’m a breakfast person, so that’s where I spent my time each morning. The buffet had cut mango, berries, and plain yogurt, plus a cook turning out omelets to order. Bread came out warm from the kitchen, and the coffee urns were refilled before they ran low. There were several herbal tea options and a toaster that actually browned evenly. Seating filled quickly after 8:30, so I went down at 7:15 and found a corner table without any wait.",
        "source_6": "For a three-night work trip, my overall take is mixed based on small things that stacked up. The bed was firm, which worked for me, but the room faced an alley and a delivery truck idled at 5:30 am two mornings in a row. I could hear hallway chatter through the door, and the elevators took several minutes around 9 am. Walking to the convention center took just over 20 minutes at a steady pace. The front desk helped hail a taxi when I was running late, and breakfast lines on Tuesday stretched back into the lobby."
