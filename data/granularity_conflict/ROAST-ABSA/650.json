        "source_1": "I took this as a first step into Python and, as an overall experience, the videos and practice notebooks stacked concepts in a way that made loops and dictionaries feel manageable. Assignment 3 did throw me off—Q1 looked right but failed until I stripped whitespace from the column headers (df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()) and rebuilt a clean DataFrame for the later questions. Once I worked around that, I was able to finish the course and even automate a small CSV cleanup task at work.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on Assignment 3: I spent three evenings trying to get Q1 accepted. The prompt says not to alter column names, yet the autograder only passed when I lowercased and trimmed them. The dataset for Q2–Q13 seems to assume a brand‑new df_clean with reset_index(drop=True) and sorted rows, but the notebook never spells that out. I kept failing due to tiny differences—row order, dtype mismatches (int64 vs float64), and hidden checks that expected .str.strip() to be applied everywhere.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on the data‑cleaning task, I actually got a lot out of it. The file had mixed capitalization in \"City\", stray spaces in \"state\", and missing ages, so I had to reach for .str.lower(), .str.strip(), fillna(0), and astype(int). After making a separate df_clean for Q2–Q13 (resetting the index and sorting), everything aligned. That single assignment pushed me to write chainable transformations and think about reproducible steps instead of one‑off fixes.",
        "source_4": "My overall takeaway is mixed enough that I didn’t complete the final week. Weeks 1–2 flowed, but by week 3 the assessments felt unpredictable: my Q1 output matched the example table, yet the grader flagged it until I guessed that the index had to be reset. The forum had multiple conflicting “fixes” and the deadline timer rolled based on my timezone, so I ended up spending more time deciphering the rubric than practicing Python.",
        "source_5": "I only care about grading reliability: Q1’s description says “order does not matter,” but the hidden test compared exact row order and strict dtypes. I passed only after adding sort_values(['id','date']), resetting the index, and casting columns to match the expected schema. If Q2–Q13 are meant to build on a corrected DataFrame, the notebook should construct it explicitly; I essentially reverse‑engineered the grader by trial and error."
