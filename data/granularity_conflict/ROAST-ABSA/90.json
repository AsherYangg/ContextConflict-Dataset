        "source_1": "I signed up primarily to check my understanding through the quizzes, and several items felt off to me. In Week 4’s quiz, there was a question asking “who inspired the angel and devil debate,” which didn’t tie into the technique we had just practiced. I kept re-reading the lesson notes and discussion threads, but the prompt seemed like trivia rather than an application of the concept. A couple of other questions had that same vibe, so even when I could solve the exercises, I guessed on those items.",
        "source_2": "I prefer shorter assessments, and this course fit that pattern for me. Each weekly quiz had about 6–8 questions, mostly multiple choice, and I wrapped them up in 8–12 minutes. The final wasn’t a marathon either—mine showed 14 items, and I finished with time to spare. I never felt buried under question fatigue.",
        "source_3": "As a whole, the course delivered exactly what I needed. The instructors explained the frameworks with concrete cases (the marketing funnel example in Week 2 really clicked), the readings were cleanly organized, and the peer review exchange pushed me to tighten my drafts. The quizzes mirrored the lessons closely—no odd curveballs—so by the time I reached the final, it felt like a recap rather than a scavenger hunt.",
        "source_4": "I focused on the teaching style, and it didn’t land for me. The lecture videos sounded like they were read straight from a script, with long pauses and little space for spontaneous examples. When I asked a clarifying question in the forum about the Week 3 rubric, I got a generic pointer to the syllabus instead of a walkthrough. Without office hours or live Q&A, the instructors felt distant.",
        "source_5": "I went through the full track on my phone and laptop and kept running into rough edges. Several slide decks looked blurry when zoomed in, and the downloadable PDF for Week 5 had two duplicate pages and a couple of typos in key definitions. The auto-generated captions lagged by a few seconds in multiple videos. The final quiz dragged on with around 30 questions, many phrased in a way that had me re-reading to figure out what was being asked, so I ended up spending nearly an hour on it."
