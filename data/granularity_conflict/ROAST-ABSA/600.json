        "source_1": "I picked up three Techno phones during the holiday sale—two for my parents and one for a friend. For around ₹8,999 each, the spec sheet covered what we needed: dual SIM, a fast refresh display, side fingerprint, and even a basic case in the box. Setup took about 20 minutes, UPI apps worked out of the gate, and calls on Airtel in Pune stayed stable during the evening commute. After the initial updates, I saw roughly 104 GB free on the 128 GB model, and my mom figured out the interface without me standing over her.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery, mine drops from 100% to 58% after three hours of YouTube at 50% brightness on 4G. The phone warms near the camera bump when recording 1080p for 15 minutes, and the 18W charger takes about 2 hours 20 minutes to go from 10% to full. On a navigation-heavy day with calls, I start looking for a socket by late afternoon. If long stretches away from a charger are common, this setup demands frequent top‑ups.",
        "source_3": "I bought the Techno mainly for the camera and spent a week testing it. Daylight shots of street vendors look crisp, but indoor photos of my toddler around 7 pm show visible grain and soft edges. The AI mode tends to push reds too far, and portrait blur sometimes trims hair or ears. Video stabilization wobbles while walking; there’s no 4K option, and 1080p at 60 fps looks smeared under tube lights. I couldn’t get Google Camera to install, and saving to the SD card once threw a write error.",
        "source_4": "I chose Techno because the banner price seemed low, but the ₹7,999 tag was tied to a bank offer I don’t use; my final bill came to ₹9,799 with GST. At that amount, the box included an 18W charger and no earphones, and the plastic back picked up scuffs in a week until I bought a separate case. Comparing to other phones in the same bracket, the value ended up hinging on sale timing and card promos more than the base sticker.",
        "source_5": "Two weeks in, the phone started freezing while switching between Instagram and Maps, so I visited the Techno service center in Indore. They kept the device for three working days and didn’t have a loaner. The staff reflashed the firmware and told me an update would arrive “soon.” The next OTA showed up a month later; the freeze eased, but Wi‑Fi still drops after waking from sleep. The hotline took 25 minutes to connect, and email support replied two days after I sent logs.",
        "source_6": "I tried using the Techno as my main phone for ten days. Dual SIM switching hung twice, which caused missed OTPs, and the loudspeaker sounded muffled on calls unless I cupped the bottom. Three preinstalled apps kept popping notifications even after I disabled them. The display is fine indoors, but at noon in Hyderabad, reading WhatsApp on the street is a struggle. I handed it off to a cousin and went back to my older device."
