        "source_1": "I took this Coursera course over four weeks, spending about three evenings a week. The journaling prompts and the “two modes of thinking” exercises pushed me to map out when I should brainstorm versus drill practice. I timed my study blocks and used the recall sheets they provided; my weekly review felt more structured than usual. The instructor’s stories about exam prep made the ideas stick, and the downloadable checklists are now on my desk.",
        "source_2": "I only want to comment on the production side. Several videos have uneven audio—intro music blares, then the voice drops so low I had to ride the volume. Captions lag by a few seconds on multiple lectures, making it hard to follow, and a couple of slides render blurry at 720p. I ended up rewatching segments purely because of these glitches.",
        "source_3": "Narrowing in on the module about the two thinking modes: the side-by-side diagrams and the 10-minute daily drills finally clarified when to step away versus push through. The instructor demonstrates with a calculus limit problem and then a foreign-language vocab list, which helped me see the pattern across subjects. I tried the exact routine before my statistics quiz and finished without that usual mental fog. That single module carried the most value for me.",
        "source_4": "As a whole, the course didn’t give me much beyond what I’ve seen on study blogs. I ran through all four weeks in a weekend at 1.5x speed because many examples repeat the same point, and the assignments are mostly checkbox reflections. Discussion forums were quiet, so peer feedback never happened. I left without a concrete plan beyond “do spaced repetition” and “avoid cramming,” which I already knew.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on assessments only: several quiz questions feel out of sync with the lectures. One asks about a mnemonic technique before it’s introduced, and another uses phrasing that could fit two choices unless you guess what the instructor means by “practice.” Since retries are unlimited, I passed by trial and error rather than by understanding. The evaluations didn’t reflect what I actually learned."
