        "source_1": "I bought this after a week of YouTube hype and regretted it by day two. The touch panel keeps missing swipes; I’ll scroll a news article and it suddenly selects a link as if I tapped. Typing is a chore because some letters don’t register unless I slow down. Double-tap to wake works one out of three tries, so I end up pressing the power button constantly. I tried a factory reset and even removed the screen protector—no change. Animations stutter like phones I used five years ago. The rear camera looks fine outdoors, but indoor shots are mushy, and the samples I saw online don’t match what I’m getting.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery life: I leave at 7 a.m. with 100% and get home at 10 p.m. still above 25%. That includes an hour of Spotify over Bluetooth, two hours of Google Maps with GPS, lots of messaging, and a mix of Wi‑Fi and 5G. Overnight drain is 2–3% with notifications on. Charging from 15% to full takes about 80–90 minutes with the included brick. I also noticed it runs cool while streaming and during long calls, which helps it hold charge better. For road trips and long workdays, it’s been very dependable.",
        "source_3": "My experience with the display has been the opposite of what I expected from some complaints. Touch accuracy is tight—I ran a multi‑touch tester and got clean 10‑point input without ghost lines. In Call of Duty Mobile, flicks and taps register immediately, and I don’t see missed inputs while strafing and firing. Sunlight legibility is decent; at max brightness I can read WhatsApp on a bright sidewalk. The panel isn’t the most vibrant, but it’s consistent, and the oleophobic coating resists smudges well. I’m using a tempered glass protector too, and it hasn’t hurt responsiveness.",
        "source_4": "Camera-only impressions: Daylight photos have plenty of detail, but skin tones lean gray and HDR sometimes nukes the sky into a flat white. Indoors, the shutter slows and moving subjects blur; the noise reduction smears hair and fabric textures. Video at 4K 30 crops in for stabilization, yet there’s still jitter when I walk. Autofocus hunts when my kid runs toward the lens, and the selfie cam softens beards and flyaway hairs. I compared with the influencer samples frame by frame, and their indoor shots look cleaner than what I can reproduce under the same lamp.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks as my main phone, I’m comfortable sticking with it. Calls are clear on both ends, apps stay in memory, and I haven’t had random reboots. The battery gets me through a full day and then some. The screen isn’t flashy, but it’s readable outdoors and I only notice an occasional missed tap when my hands are sweaty. The camera won’t replace a dedicated shooter, yet it’s perfectly serviceable for social posts and quick family clips. The online buzz oversold it a bit as a “game changer,” but as a daily tool it handles work email, maps, and photos without fuss."
