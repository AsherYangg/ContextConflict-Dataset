        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for its camera and have been shooting a lot of family moments with it. Daylight photos come out crisp, with skin tones that don’t lean too red or gray, and the portrait mode separates hair strands better than I expected. The 4K 30 fps video has steady stabilization when I’m walking, and panning doesn’t produce that jelly effect I’ve seen on other phones. Night mode, when I brace it against a railing or use a tiny tripod, keeps window lights from blowing out and preserves brick textures. I’ve printed a few 8x10s from the 48 MP shots, and the edges still look clean without watercolor smearing.",
        "source_2": "After about a year and a half, the battery has been my only headache. AccuBattery shows health around 79%, and my screen-on time sits at roughly 4.5 hours with Instagram, maps, and some light gaming. It drops 6–8% overnight in airplane mode, which feels off, and the last 20% drains fast during video calls. I replaced the cable and tried a factory reset; the idle drain didn’t change. Charging from 15% to full takes a little over two hours with the original brick, and the phone gets warm near the top-left corner while topping up.",
        "source_3": "This has been my daily driver for 18 months, and the basics hold up well: calls are clear on both SIMs, the fingerprint reader unlocks reliably, and the screen stays readable under midday sun. The speaker is a bit thin but fine for podcasts. The camera is the only area where I wish for more—indoor shots look soft unless I tap to focus and hold steady, and fast-moving kids come out blurry. Outdoors, though, vacation photos of beaches and buildings look sharp enough for sharing without edits.",
        "source_4": "Day-to-day use hasn’t been smooth for me after the last big update. Apps reload when I switch between banking and messages, the keyboard lags on the first few taps, and Bluetooth drops in my car after about 20 minutes on calls. Wi‑Fi handoff between my router and mesh node causes short disconnects, and I’ve had two random reboots this month. Strangely, the camera does fine for school events—1080p 60 fps records my son’s recital without choppiness, and the auto exposure doesn’t flicker under gym lights—so I’m not complaining there, but everything else has felt flaky.",
        "source_5": "I only use this as a pocket camera for my small online store, and it struggles with product shots. White labels on brown cardboard blow out under LED bulbs, and the noise in the darker corners looks gritty even after I slide the exposure down. The camera app takes about two seconds to open from the lock screen, which has cost me a few quick pictures when packing orders. Close-ups of jewelry lose detail around the edges, and the HDR sometimes turns stainless steel a weird blue-gray that I can’t color-correct easily."
