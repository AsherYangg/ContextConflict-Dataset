        "source_1": "I stayed three nights with my two kids and picked it mainly because it sits right in the middle of everything. We could walk to the cathedral in about 7 minutes and the riverfront in ten, so we didn’t bother with transit. The lobby had a clean, modern look and our corner room felt airy, with big windows and heavy curtains that blocked the morning sun. The bathroom had a proper walk‑in shower with a glass door instead of the usual tub sprayer. We’d hit the basement pool around 6:30 pm to unwind before late dinners; water was warm and there were extra towels by the door. The kids kept asking to go back.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about bathrooms, so here’s the rundown. The shower is a true walk‑in with a fixed rain head plus a handheld wand, not one of those awkward half‑curtain setups. Water pressure stayed steady even when my partner ran the sink, and the temperature didn’t yo‑yo. There’s a long ledge for toiletries, a non-slip floor, and the exhaust fan actually clears steam—my mirror barely fogged. Towels were thick, and the hairdryer wasn’t the usual underpowered wall unit. If you care about having a proper shower in Europe, this checks the boxes.",
        "source_3": "I booked for the central location, and yes, you can walk everywhere—but being in the middle also means street noise. Our room faced a narrow lane with bars, and chatter and scooters carried past midnight. Delivery trucks started beeping around 6 am on weekdays. The double glazing helped, but I still reached for earplugs. Midday, the sidewalks were packed with tour groups, so pushing a stroller took patience. It’s undeniably convenient for sightseeing, but if you’re hoping to nap in the afternoon or turn in early, ask for a high, courtyard-facing room.",
        "source_4": "My focus was the pool for a pre-dinner unwind, but the timing matters. Between 6 and 7:30 pm it was crowded, mostly families, and there were only six loungers—most held with towels. The space is underground with no windows, so it felt a bit close, and the chlorine smell was strong one evening. Towels ran out once and weren’t restocked for twenty minutes. Early morning (before 9) was calmer; I actually got a lane to myself then. If your plan is a quiet soak before heading out to eat, be prepared to share the space.",
        "source_5": "For anyone wondering about sleep quality: the mattress in my room leaned firm and the pillows were thin. I asked housekeeping for two extras, which helped, but the first night was a toss‑and‑turn. The HVAC kept a steady 21°C but had a constant low hum, and the duvet felt heavy for summer. On the plus side, the blackout curtains were excellent, and the room door had a solid seal that kept hallway noise down. If you like a softer bed, consider requesting a topper in advance.",
        "source_6": "The property photographs beautifully—brass fixtures, dark tile, and mid‑century chairs—but some design choices felt fussy in practice. The moody lighting in the hallways made it hard to read room numbers, and the bedside switches took trial and error to figure out which lamp they controlled. In the bathroom, the matte black tiles looked sharp but showed water spots instantly, so it never looked “just cleaned” for long. The lounge chairs in the lobby were stylish yet a bit low and not ideal for working on a laptop. Looks polished, but everyday usability could be easier."
