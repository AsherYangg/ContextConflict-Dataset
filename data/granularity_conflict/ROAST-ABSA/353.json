        "source_1": "I bought a 80-count box of Lyons after a coworker raved about how “smooth” it was, but in my kitchen it leans thin unless I push it hard. I use 8 oz of filtered water at a rolling boil, one pyramid bag, 4 minutes steep time, no milk on the first sip. The liquor comes out a bright copper, but the body feels hollow and the finish turns a little drying on the tongue. To get any heft, I have to go 2 bags for 10 oz or extend to 6 minutes, which then nudges in a raspy edge. Side‑by‑side with Barry’s Gold at the same parameters, Barry’s gives me the creamy mouthfeel I was hoping for here.",
        "source_2": "Over the last month this has become my morning cup. One bag in a pre‑warmed mug, boil the kettle, pour and steep about 3–4 minutes. It gives off a toasty, malty aroma and a clean copper color that takes a splash of whole milk without turning murky. I can leave it an extra minute while packing lunches and it doesn’t go harsh on me. With milk and a half teaspoon of sugar, it’s steady and comforting, and it pairs nicely with buttered toast. For a straightforward daily brew that doesn’t demand fussing, this fits my routine.",
        "source_3": "My issue is freshness. The box I received (best‑by 04/2026, code L2309) had paper‑wrapped bags with no foil, and the seal on the inner bag was a bit loose when I opened it. The first cup smelled muted out of the pouch, and the brewed aroma felt subdued, almost as if the top notes had faded. Contrast that with the same brand I picked up at Dublin Airport last year—those were in tight foil and burst with a malty scent the moment I tore a sachet. With this shipment, the taste settles flat unless I sweeten it or add milk, which makes me think the batch sat too long or didn’t travel well.",
        "source_4": "I focus on lift, and this doesn’t deliver the kick I look for. I brew at about 205°F, 10–12 oz, 4 minutes, and even tried doubling the bag on sleepy mornings. The flavor comes through, but the alertness just isn’t there compared to Yorkshire Tea or PG Tips for me. By 11 a.m. I’m reaching for a second cup to get the same focus I usually get from one. If your priority is a strong wake‑up, be prepared to adjust with two bags or a longer steep.",
        "source_5": "I wanted a robust Irish breakfast profile but ended up rotating back to my usual brand. The bags in my box had a lot of tiny leaf bits—when I tore one open out of curiosity, it was mostly fine particles. The brew clouds quickly when I add milk, and there’s a faint metallic aftertaste that lingers. I tried tweaks—lower temp water, shorter steeps, even a French press for more control—but I kept bouncing between watery cups and astringent ones. After a week of experimenting, I finished the box for iced tea and restocked PG Tips for my morning mug."
