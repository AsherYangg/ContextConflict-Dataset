        "source_1": "I signed up expecting a brisk rhythm, but by the end of Week 2 I was watching every lecture at 1.5x just to keep the thread. In the “Limits and Continuity” segment, the instructor spends the first three minutes carefully writing the title and the axes on the whiteboard, then narrates each symbol as it’s penned. At normal speed, my attention drifts and I find myself rechecking timestamps to see how far I’ve gotten. When Carlos steps in during the short recap clips, his delivery feels tighter—he gets to the example right away and wraps within five minutes—so I started skipping to his sections whenever possible.",
        "source_2": "I want to zoom in on the instructor’s habit of writing while speaking. I keep the captions off and mirror the notation in my notebook as he forms each letter and symbol. The slow enunciation helps me catch every variable—especially when Greek letters show up—and I rarely need to rewind. In “Derivative Rules,” he lays out the product rule line-by-line and says the terms as he writes them; that pacing matches my note-taking speed. Carlos’s checkpoints are fine, but I prefer the main instructor’s longer chalkboard sequences because they leave me with clean, complete notes rather than screenshots.",
        "source_3": "Overall, the course is very structured: clear weekly goals, graded problem sets that ramp from routine computations to proofs, and office-hour recordings where Carlos answers forum questions with worked examples. The lecture tempo is steady, not rushed, which pairs well with the practice drills that review the same technique in multiple contexts. I used the mobile app to download Week 3 videos and worked through them during my commute; being able to nudge playback to 1.25x was enough to keep focus without missing details. The final quiz ties together the earlier modules, and the rubric made it obvious where I slipped.",
        "source_4": "I took Jim Fowler’s Calculus One last year and came into this with that cadence in mind. Here, the delivery is more deliberate, and I found myself toggling between 1x and 1.5x depending on the segment. Fowler jumps into examples quickly and uses rapid board transitions; this course lingers on setup and narrates each definition before touching problems. That contrast matters if you’re looking for momentum. I ended up using this course to brush up on formal definitions and then switched back to Fowler for faster practice sessions, while still returning to Carlos’s recap clips when I wanted a concise summary.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing to the instructor’s multitasking: when he writes and talks at the same time, I lose track of which part of the sentence refers to what’s being written. In “Chain Rule,” he says “inner function” as he’s halfway through sketching a composite diagram, and I miss the moment he names u(x) versus f(g(x)). I keep pausing to line up the audio with the handwriting, which stretches a 12‑minute video into 20. Carlos’s voiceovers don’t have this mismatch—he speaks over slides with the symbols already on-screen—so the alignment is clearer, but the main lectures are what carry most of the content."
