        "source_1": "I’m weighing in only on the plumbing. In room 418, the toilet gurgled late at night and the bathroom sink ran brown for about half a minute around 6:30 a.m. the first two mornings. Water pressure in the shower pulsed from a trickle to a blast, and maintenance came by twice to “bleed the lines,” which meant pipe banging in the walls just after sunrise. The front desk explained the system was still getting back to normal after recent work, and they dropped off extra towels and a plunger, but the inconsistency never fully settled during my three-night stay.",
        "source_2": "I care almost exclusively about bedding and linens, and this place delivered on that front. My king bed had a pillow-top that cushioned my shoulders without swallowing me, and the down duvet was light but kept me warm with the thermostat at 68. The sheets felt smooth and cool to the touch, and the pillows came in two firmness levels, so I swapped them around until my neck felt supported. Towels were thick and full-sized, not those narrow ones that won’t wrap around, and housekeeping refreshed everything without that stiff detergent smell.",
        "source_3": "As the person logistics-wrangling our destination wedding, I interacted mostly with the bell staff. We rolled up with eight suitcases, three garment bags, and two boxes of centerpieces; they brought two carts, wrapped the boxes in plastic, and labeled each piece with our room numbers. They kept the load in a locked storage room while we checked in, then coordinated a service elevator so we didn’t block the main one during a busy hour. The next morning at 7 a.m., they had the carts staged, helped hang the gowns on a rolling rack, and later loaded everything into our van in about ten minutes. They even tracked down a misplaced laptop sleeve by checking the storage shelves and calling our room.",
        "source_4": "We stayed three nights for our wedding and used the hotel as home base for family coming in and out. Check-in took about five minutes, and the lobby never felt chaotic even with multiple groups arriving. The first morning, the water took a while to heat and sputtered a bit, but after a quick call someone flushed the line and it was fine the rest of the day. Our room stayed quiet at night, the bed made it easy to fall asleep after late receptions, and the towels felt substantial after long showers. Between the easy arrivals, helpful staff moving our gear, and comfortable sleep, we’re already talking about coming back for an anniversary weekend.",
        "source_5": "I was in a second-floor room with other guests from the same wedding, and my overall take is shaped by the basics. The bathroom had a faint drain odor that came and went, and the shower never held a steady temperature long enough to rinse without fiddling with the handle. Housekeeping didn’t reach our floor until late afternoon on day two, so we ended up reusing damp towels after a midday shower. The mattress itself felt cushioned and the bell desk handled our boxes without fuss, but the on-and-off water situation and timing of service made the stay feel like more work than it should have. After three nights, I left wishing the fundamentals had been more dependable."
