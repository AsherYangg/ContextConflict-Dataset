        "source_1": "I drink green tea daily, and Numi’s jasmine has become my weekday ritual. One bag in a 12 oz mug, water around 175–180°F, 3 minutes, and I get a gentle floral note without a harsh edge. A squeeze of lemon and a teaspoon of honey round it out nicely. If I have extra, I leave the bag in and chill what’s left in a mason jar; it stays clean-tasting with lunch. I grabbed two boxes on Amazon—Subscribe & Save brought the per‑bag cost below what my local store charges, and they landed on my porch the next day.",
        "source_2": "Bitterness check only: Even with cooler water (about 165–170°F) and a short steep of 90 seconds, this comes out astringent for me. I tried three times with filtered water and different mugs, and that drying sensation sticks around after each sip. When I brew a larger cup and leave the bag in for iced tea, the edge becomes puckery enough that I have to dilute it or mix it with a milder green.",
        "source_3": "Jasmine aroma focus: I can barely pick up the floral scent. One bag in an 8 oz cup at 175°F for 3 minutes smells like plain green tea to my nose. I only notice any blossom character when I double‑bag, but then the base tea starts to taste stewed. Adding lemon brings out brightness, but it mostly tastes like lemon rather than jasmine.",
        "source_4": "Price only: I paid $8.99 on Amazon for the 18‑count box last week; my neighborhood co‑op has the same box on the shelf for $6.49, and it hits $5.99 during sales. With tax and no Prime shipping on this listing, my online total ended up higher. For me, this wasn’t the lowest‑cost place to buy it.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after a month: Hot, it’s smooth enough for a mid‑afternoon break—one bag, 10 oz water, 175°F, 2.5 minutes—and a spoon of honey plus a lemon slice makes it calming. As iced tea, though, it feels thin. I brewed a big mug, left the bag in for another 5 minutes, cooled it, and refrigerated overnight; the next day it tasted grassy and faded quickly against dinner. I’ll keep it for hot cups but reach for another brand when I want a pitcher for the fridge."
