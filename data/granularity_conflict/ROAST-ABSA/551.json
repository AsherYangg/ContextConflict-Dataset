        "source_1": "I only want to talk about the air in the room we got for our last night. The walls looked freshly painted and the hall had that sharp solvent smell as soon as the elevator doors opened. Inside the room, the scent was strong enough that my eyes watered. We asked at the desk if there was another room available; they were full, but they brought up a fan and suggested cracking the windows. With the fan running and windows open, the smell lessened but never fully went away. I ended up sleeping with a damp towel over my face and woke up with a mild headache. The bed itself seemed fine, but the lingering fumes were the defining feature of that night.",
        "source_2": "Family of four here—two adults and our college-age kids. We split the stay between one of the apartments (five nights) and then one night in a regular hotel room before our early flight. In the apartment, we had a small kitchenette that worked for breakfast, and the courtyard-facing windows kept street noise down. We walked to dinner each evening without needing a taxi, and the nearest metro entrances were a quick stroll—felt like five minutes tops, with trains every few minutes. The front desk printed our museum time slots so we didn’t waste time queuing, and housekeeping kept the place tidy without moving our stuff around. Beds were supportive enough that no one woke up stiff. The building felt secure; the entrance required a key fob and there was someone at the desk late. Price-wise, we didn’t feel squeezed—spent more on pastries than the room, which says a lot.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on location: I had meetings near the river and picked this place thinking the metro would make the commute effortless. In reality, the closest station had an entrance blocked off for maintenance, and the alternative route added two transfers. Morning rush hour meant packed trains, and with luggage it was a hassle. Walking to the station involved crossing a busy avenue without a clear pedestrian signal cycle, and the sidewalks felt cramped. After 9 p.m., the area around the hotel seemed quiet in a way that made finding a quick bite difficult; several spots were closed or full. It wasn’t impossible to get around, but the logistics were more fiddly than I expected.",
        "source_4": "I’m zeroing in on noise in the room we had—no commentary on anything else. The room was adjacent to the stairwell, and I could hear footsteps and door latches clicking late into the night. At around 6 a.m., street cleaners passed by and the sound carried through the window even though it was shut. Housekeeping started down the hall early; the cart wheels and the occasional conversation were audible. If you’re a light sleeper, ask for a room away from the stairs and not facing the main road, or bring earplugs.",
        "source_5": "Service is the only thing I want to cover. The morning concierge pulled out a map and highlighted two different routes to the museum, including the one that avoided the weekend track work. Housekeeping found my cufflink under the bed and left it on the desk with a note. The night manager came outside to help us load bags into the taxi at 4:45 a.m. without being asked, and earlier in the stay someone brought up a couple of spare power adapters after noticing we were trying to charge four phones with one plug. Check-in took less than five minutes, and they stored our bags between the apartment checkout and the hotel room move without any drama."
