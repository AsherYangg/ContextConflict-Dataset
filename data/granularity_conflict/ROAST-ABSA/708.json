        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for selfies, and after a week of trying every trick in the camera settings, I’m still struggling. With the beauty filters off and HDR on, indoor shots under warm LED bulbs end up smeared around the eyes and hair, and the focus hunts if I hold the phone at arm’s length. Outdoors it’s better, but highlights blow out easily on sunny afternoons, and portrait mode keeps blurring my ears along with the background. Front video at 1080p looks shaky when I walk, and the mic picks up street noise more than my voice. I wanted something I could use for quick Instagram stories at cafés, and I’ve started carrying a ring light just to get faces to look clean.",
        "source_2": "The bundled File Manager is a headache for handling videos. It shows generic icons instead of thumbnails, so I can’t tell which clip is which without opening each one. The uninstall option is greyed out, and even after “Force stop,” it relaunches itself when I try to attach files in WhatsApp or Telegram. I installed Files by Google, which displays thumbnails instantly, but the phone keeps defaulting back to the stock app for attachments. Under Settings → Apps → Default apps, there’s no way to choose a different file manager for media pickers, so every time I need to send a video, I end up tapping through multiple clips just to find the right one.",
        "source_3": "Strictly talking memory and storage: it’s been solid for my multitasking. I keep Instagram, Chrome (about 10 tabs), Spotify, Maps, and Reddit open all day, and when I jump back to Chrome after using the camera, the tabs don’t reload. Copying a 2.2 GB movie from internal storage to a folder took about 45–50 seconds, and installing a batch of 18 app updates over Wi‑Fi finished without freezing the UI. I also tried exporting a 4K timelapse from a third‑party app; while the CPU was clearly working, other apps stayed responsive. Whatever they’ve done with memory management, it doesn’t evict my commonly used apps as quickly as my old phone did.",
        "source_4": "After two weeks, my impression of the phone as a whole is that it sits in the middle and doesn’t justify the 13,000 I paid. Daytime rear camera shots look soft when I zoom in, night photos have blotchy shadows, and the selfie cam smears skin even with the beautification slider at zero. The preloaded File Manager issue is constant, and not being able to remove it makes everyday sharing slower. Calls are clear and storage feels fine, but if I compare the photos I took at a family event to my cousin’s Samsung at the same price, theirs come out cleaner and need less editing. If I were buying again, I’d pick that route.",
        "source_5": "Using it as my daily device for three weeks, I’ve been getting through full days on a single charge with mixed use (two hours of streaming, 30 minutes of Maps navigation, a bunch of photos at lunch, and messaging). The screen is bright enough outdoors, and the rear camera in daylight gives me printable shots; with a GCam port, the dynamic range jumps noticeably. Selfie photos look okay when I stand near a window, and I just avoid dim restaurants. I don’t rely on the stock File Manager—I set Files by Google to handle my browsing, and thumbnails appear instantly. App launches don’t feel sluggish, and for 13k, it covers my commute, work chats, and weekend errands without fuss.",
        "source_6": "Focusing only on the rear camera, I spent a Sunday at the park shooting flowers and street scenes. Colors come out natural rather than oversaturated, and HDR does a decent job of keeping the sky from bleaching. The autofocus locks quickly on moving subjects like cyclists; macro shots are softer than I’d like, but stepping back and cropping yields sharp results. Video at 1080p looks stable if I walk slowly, and panning doesn’t introduce heavy jitter. Indoors under tungsten bulbs, noise creeps in, yet with a bit of light from a desk lamp, the detail returns. I printed a few 5×7 photos from these, and they look good framed on my wall."
