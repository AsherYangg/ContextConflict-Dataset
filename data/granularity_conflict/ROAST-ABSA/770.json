        "source_1": "I attended every live session with Ma’am. She speaks at a steady pace and uses slides with bulleted steps, but the transitions between topics sometimes happen mid-sentence. The Q&A slots are short, usually 5–7 minutes, so I had to take questions to the forum. Captions are auto-generated; they occasionally miss technical terms (for example, “regularization” showed as “regulation”). I ended up pausing often and replaying segments to catch the derivations.",
        "source_2": "I interacted with mentors throughout Weeks 2–4. When I posted about a bug in the notebook, three mentors responded with different scripts, and I spent an evening merging their advice. Office hours were listed at 11 p.m. my time, so I watched the recordings instead. One mentor did follow up with a step-by-step thread that finally got my environment running. The grade recheck I requested was closed after nine days, which stretched into the next module.",
        "source_3": "I took the entire course end-to-end. The syllabus breaks into weekly modules with short videos, quizzes, and a peer project, and the calendar reminders hit my email like clockwork. After Week 2 the pace ramps up, and three deadlines landed within 48 hours, which made me rearrange work meetings. Prerequisites are listed as basic Python, but the assignments expect comfort with NumPy broadcasting and scikit-learn pipelines. The capstone rubric leaves room for interpretation, so peer feedback varied from detailed notebooks to single-line comments.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing just on structure. Each module starts with objectives and a checklist, and the sequence goes theory → demo → assignment. Navigation on mobile shows Module 3 videos under Module 4 for a few hours after release, so I had to restart the app to see the right order. Video descriptions lack timestamps for sections, which makes it tricky to jump back to the “data cleaning” portion. Deadlines shifted twice during my cohort due to platform maintenance, and the announcement came after I had planned my study slots.",
        "source_5": "I finished in three weeks while working a regular 9–6. I downloaded transcripts for commute study, took notes in Notion, and re-did the quizzes to raise my score. The case study on customer churn connected the lecture material to a real dataset, and the notebook ran on Colab without dependency issues. Mentors moderated live chat and linked to extra readings after sessions. I’m lining up the follow-on course next month because the project pathway leads into it.",
        "source_6": "I want to talk only about the peer-graded project. The rubric asks for visualizations, model choice justification, and error analysis, but the examples don’t show a full error analysis, so reviewers marked me down for not meeting an unclear section. Resubmission was open for 24 hours, and the platform flagged my notebook for plagiarism even though it was built from scratch; support cleared it two days later. Feedback ranged from a paragraph with code snippets to “looks fine,” which made it hard to iterate. A sample solution or instructor walkthrough would align expectations."
