        "source_1": "I’m zeroing in on the touch behavior during calls: the screen keeps going dark and won’t wake when I need to end or put a call on hold. I find myself pressing the side button repeatedly—sometimes 6–8 times—before the screen finally responds, and a couple of times the call continued for a full minute after I thought I’d hung up. This doesn’t happen in other apps; swiping and typing are smooth there, so it feels specific to the in-call screen. I removed the tempered glass to rule that out and even cleaned the area around the top sensor, but the issue persists on both mobile and VoIP calls. It’s made me keep a wired headset handy just so I can use the inline controls to hang up.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on after‑sales support: I walked into the authorized service center on Richmond Road with a case number, and they ran diagnostics for about 15 minutes, then shipped my phone to the main facility in Bangalore. I got status updates by SMS each evening, and the phone came back on the fourth business day with a note saying the proximity module and display assembly were replaced. The technician let me test a few long calls before signing off, and even showed me the replaced parts bagged with the work order. The process felt organized—no fees since it was under warranty, and they handled all the courier logistics.",
        "source_3": "Overall impression after three weeks: setup was smooth, battery comfortably gets me through a full day (around 5–6 hours screen‑on with calls, Slack, and maps), and the interface feels quick. I spend a lot of time on conference calls, and the call UI has behaved as expected—screen turns off when near my ear and wakes instantly when I move it away. Camera performance in low light surprised me, and the speakers are loud enough for hands‑free chats in the car. Between Face ID speed, haptics, and the display quality, the device feels polished across the board.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the device hasn’t lived up to what I need for work. On day two, the call screen started ignoring taps, and I missed a client handoff because I couldn’t end a call or switch to the keypad for an IVR prompt. Twice I had to force‑restart by holding the side and volume buttons after long presses did nothing, and the issue resurfaced within hours. The retail store declined an exchange because the return window had just closed, and the service center sent it away with a “no fault found” note even though I reproduced it in front of them. The camera and battery are fine, but that doesn’t help when basic call controls fail at random.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing down to call handling with accessories: I make daily 30–40 minute calls using AirPods and often switch between Bluetooth and the phone’s earpiece mid‑call. The screen reliably wakes with a single press, and I can hit mute or keypad without delay; I even tested with a thick screen protector, and it didn’t affect responsiveness. The only time I noticed a momentary lag was when I had a screen recording running—ending the call took an extra second, but taps still registered. For my routine (lots of toggling speaker/Bluetooth, frequent holds), the touch response during calls has been consistent."
