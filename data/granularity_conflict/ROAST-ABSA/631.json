        "source_1": "I stayed one night in July and the logistics were easy. After landing at Schiphol around 7 pm, I hopped on the 397 bus and got off near Museumplein; it was a short walk with my carry-on to the hotel. The front desk found me a phone charger from the lost-and-found, printed my museum time slot for the morning, and pointed me to a row of terraces a couple blocks away for dinner. The only sting was the in-room Wi‑Fi, which was sold per day and per device, so I used the lobby PC to check in for my flight instead. Later that night I sat at the hotel bar for a local beer and a slice of warm apple pie with whipped cream that really stood out. For a quick city stopover, the combination of airport connection and walking access to the museums worked well for me.",
        "source_2": "I booked a superior room specifically to take a late-night video call, and the internet setup made it tricky. The in-room Wi‑Fi required buying a voucher around 14–15 EUR for 24 hours, and it tied to a single device. The speed was fine for email but wobbled during screen sharing, and the upload rate dipped under 1 Mbps at times. There was a desktop PC by reception that anyone could use, but there were two people waiting when I checked, and I couldn’t install my conferencing app on it. If your plan involves working from the room, factor in the extra cost and the limitations.",
        "source_3": "My stay was all about location, and it didn’t quite match what I expected. With a rolling suitcase, the “walk to the Van Gogh Museum” took me close to 25 minutes because of canal bridges and crowds, and I ended up catching tram 2 the next day to save time. Getting to the airport still took roughly 35–40 minutes including the wait for the bus, and late at night the frequency dropped, so I paid for a rideshare instead. The nearby terraces were busy and loud until late, and most places asked for reservations, so I ended up eating a few blocks away. It’s workable, but not the breezy hop people sometimes describe.",
        "source_4": "I focused on service because I arrived after a long train ride. Check-in had a single agent and a line of five, so I waited about 15 minutes. When I asked for tram directions, the concierge pointed to a brochure stand rather than walking me through the route, and I still boarded the wrong line. The next morning, housekeeping knocked twice before 9 am even though I had the do-not-disturb tag on, and my bags weren’t ready at luggage storage when I came back to collect them. Nothing disastrous, just a sense that the team was stretched.",
        "source_5": "I didn’t stay overnight; I met a colleague at the hotel bar and ended up ordering dessert. The bartender suggested the Dutch apple pie, served warm with a thick crust, chunky cinnamon apples, and a generous cloud of whipped cream. The bar had low lighting, a mellow jazz playlist, and a few locals nursing beers, which made it a comfortable place to unwind after a rainy afternoon. I would happily come back just for that pie and a nightcap.",
        "source_6": "I used this hotel for a short layover between flights. The building has a classic feel, and I was able to reach the Van Gogh Museum on foot before my timed entry, then catch a direct bus back toward the airport the next morning. I spent the evening on a nearby terrace and then popped into the hotel bar for a drink. The only budget surprise was the paid internet in the room, which added a noticeable amount to the bill for just a few hours online. As a base for sightseeing with an easy airport link, it did the job, but it’s better suited to travelers who don’t need heavy online work from the room."
