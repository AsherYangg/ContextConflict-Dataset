        "source_1": "We stayed at Hotel Aalders for four nights and it worked well for our museum-heavy itinerary. Check-in was smooth even though our flight got in late; the night receptionist buzzed us in at 1 a.m. and handed over the key within minutes. Our room on the third floor had a comfortable bed, a radiator that kept things warm in March, and a TV with a few English-language channels. The bathroom had a tub-shower combo, a hairdryer, and small bottles of shower gel that housekeeping replaced when they cleaned the room each day. From the front door, it took us about five minutes to walk to the Rijksmuseum, and we could cut through Vondelpark for evening strolls. Breakfast had breads, cheeses, boiled eggs, and fruit; we filled up before heading out. I sent a couple of work emails from the bar’s computer after dinner and appreciated not needing to hunt down a café. We did notice the stairs were a bit narrow, so carrying a big suitcase took a little maneuvering.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing strictly on breakfast. Over two mornings, I noticed a big difference depending on the time. At 9:30 a.m., the dining room was crowded and several trays—croissants, cold cuts—were empty for stretches. The coffee machine had a line and took a minute per cup, so a small queue formed. The next day I came down at 7:45 a.m. and everything was laid out: fresh bread baskets, yogurts, boiled eggs, and fruit, with staff walking around to refill. If you’re aiming for variety without waiting, earlier seemed to make a real difference.",
        "source_3": "I had to upload a work file during my stay and relied on the hotel’s internet. The connection was available in the bar, not in my room, so I parked myself at a table around 11 p.m. The signal worked, but speeds jumped around—fast enough for email, then dipping when I tried to sync a large folder. I got disconnected twice and had to log back in. The day receptionist suggested a cable for the room, but my laptop didn’t have the right port. It did the job eventually; just expect to sit in the bar if you need a steady connection.",
        "source_4": "For an overall picture: the location made it easy to hit the museums, but our street-facing room picked up tram noise starting around 6 a.m. The windows looked older, and we could hear conversations from the sidewalk when people gathered outside. The bathroom felt tight; the shower curtain clung, and the hairdryer overheated and shut off mid-use, then worked again after cooling. Housekeeping missed replacing the shower gel on our second day, though the front desk sent some up when we asked. We arrived close to midnight on our first night and the 24-hour reception was handy for storing luggage while we grabbed a late snack. Sleep was a bit patchy, but getting to the sights fast was a trade-off we accepted.",
        "source_5": "I’m reviewing only the front desk service. On day one, the receptionist pulled out a map and marked a walking route to the canal cruise, then booked our seats so we didn’t have to stand in line. She also reserved two spots on a day tour outside the city and printed the confirmation tickets. The next morning, a different staff member suggested a café on a quiet side street and pointed out which tram stop to avoid during rush hour. Late one evening, we called down for a taxi and the night receptionist had it waiting in under ten minutes. The guidance saved us time and kept us away from the most congested areas."
