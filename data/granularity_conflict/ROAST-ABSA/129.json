        "source_1": "I brew one bag in 8 ounces at about 200°F for 3 minutes. The cup turns a clear amber with a malty backbone and a light honey note; even if I forget and let it sit to 5 minutes, it doesn’t go harsh. It takes a splash of milk without getting muddy, and a squeeze of lemon stays bright. Side by side with my grocery-store black tea, this one has a fuller body and a cleaner finish.",
        "source_2": "I track pantry costs in a spreadsheet. My last case was 240 bags at $33, which works out to about 13.8 cents per bag. At two cups a day, that’s roughly eight dollars a month for me—less than what I spent on k-cups or café drinks. Subscribe-and-save shaved a little more off, so the total sits comfortably within my weekly budget.",
        "source_3": "The box uses foil sleeves, but one sleeve had a tiny split along the seam. By week five the aroma had faded, and the brew looked pale even with a 4-minute steep. Several bags had crushed corners near the staple. I moved the rest into a glass jar with a silicone seal to slow the decline, yet it never returned to the lively cup from the first few days.",
        "source_4": "As a family that goes through five to six bags daily, the taste is consistent and the foil helps the last bag match the first, but our grocery bill jumped more than expected. Even buying the bulk option, the per-bag cost sits around 13–14 cents, and shipping nudged it higher. We started stretching it by mixing half-and-half with a cheaper house brand.",
        "source_5": "For my morning routine, this checks the boxes: steady flavor, no bitterness even when I get distracted, and the foil sleeves kept the stash fragrant over three months in a dry pantry. The per-bag price runs a bit higher than the warehouse brand I used to buy, but the dependable cup keeps me reaching for this one.",
        "source_6": "Mine arrived during a July heat wave. The outer carton was sturdy, the inner foil packs were intact—no puffed seams or crushed stacks—and not a single bag was torn. It sat on my porch for two weeks while I was traveling, and the first brew still opened up with a fresh aroma, so the packaging handled transport and storage well."
