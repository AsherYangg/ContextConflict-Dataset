        "source_1": "I booked mainly for the MTR access. You don’t step out of the lobby straight onto a platform—you cut through the outlet mall, ride a couple of escalators, and then reach Tung Chung station. With a 23 kg suitcase, weaving through shoppers wasn’t fun. In the evening peak it took me about 35–40 minutes door-to-door to Tsim Sha Tsui with a transfer at Lai King, so the “20 minutes to Kowloon” claim didn’t match my timings.",
        "source_2": "I landed around 6:20 a.m. hoping to get a room to freshen up. The front desk stored my bags and offered access to a shower, but they wouldn’t release a room until 10:45 unless I agreed to a half-day charge. Staff were courteous but firm about check-in times, so early access wasn’t a given in my case.",
        "source_3": "Standard king on a mid-level floor. The bed was wedged between a structural column and the window, and once the suitcase rack was open there was only a narrow walkway. The wardrobe was so shallow my blazer brushed the door, and the bathroom had a sliding door that didn’t fully seal. The layout felt tight despite what the photos suggested.",
        "source_4": "The rate looked fair online, but the final bill climbed: 10% service charge, a sizable card hold as a deposit, breakfast priced separately, and no complimentary airport shuttle. Two small waters from the minibar added more than I expected. Between that and transportation, the stay ended up costing more than I’d budgeted.",
        "source_5": "One-night layover. I arrived mid-morning and was handed keys by about 9:15 without any hoops. Being able to walk straight into the four-story outlet mall and then into Tung Chung station made grabbing lunch and hopping to Mong Kok easy—roughly 25 minutes platform to platform that afternoon. The room had a long desk, plenty of sockets, and solid blackout curtains. For a quick stop between flights, this worked well.",
        "source_6": "Stayed two nights for sightseeing. The property feels grafted onto the mall: busy lifts at closing time, crowds cutting through the lobby, and early aircraft noise on my side of the building. Reaching the main sights meant daily rides and transfers on the MTR, and by the second day I wished I’d booked in Tsim Sha Tsui to cut the commute. The room was tidy but plain, and the overall atmosphere leaned more transit hub than relaxing base."
