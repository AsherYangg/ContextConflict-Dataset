        "source_1": "I booked the four-night Trailfinders package because the headline price looked attractive. The base rate showed £135 per night, but on arrival the hotel added a £27 nightly facility fee and city tax that hadn’t been obvious in the quotation. The airport transfer bundled with the package didn’t match my flight time, so I paid £32 for a taxi anyway. When I totaled everything—room, fees, and transport—I came out to roughly £175 per night. I had a comparison sheet of direct options around £160 with breakfast included, so on pure cost, the package wasn’t the deal I thought it was.",
        "source_2": "From the moment I arrived, staff knew my name from the booking notes, and check-in took under five minutes. Housekeeping, however, skipped the room twice for turn-down and didn’t replace coffee pods or toiletries until I called down. The night manager sent someone up within ten minutes, and the follow-up the next day included a handwritten note, which was thoughtful. Room service answered quickly, but the tray sat outside my door until mid-morning. My interactions were a mix of warm touches and a few lapses.",
        "source_3": "We chose this place because we wanted to see the main sights on foot. The museum district was about a 10-minute walk, and the riverfront promenade took us 15 minutes with two kids and a stroller. There’s a metro stop two blocks away, so getting to the old town was easy. The street out front is a busy artery; crossing with a stroller felt dicey at rush hour, and we could hear late-night traffic until around 1 a.m., even on the sixth floor. Convenience stores and cafés are clustered within a few minutes, which made quick breakfasts simple.",
        "source_4": "I booked through Trailfinders and was given a corner suite on check-in without asking. The room had a view over the skyline, a king bed that actually felt supportive, and blackout curtains that kept the place dark even with neon outside. The breakfast buffet had fresh pastries, a station for eggs made to order, and a few local items I hadn’t tried before. Wi‑Fi clocked around 80 Mbps down, which handled video calls fine, though the elevators backed up around 9 a.m. and I waited nearly 10 minutes one morning. Between the walkability to the main sights and the way the front desk handled small requests, the stay felt easy.",
        "source_5": "I wouldn’t book this hotel again based on my last stay. Check-in stretched past 30 minutes with only one staffer working the desk, and the suite smelled faintly of damp, especially near the window. The thermostat read 23°C but the room felt warmer, and the fan made a rattling sound at night. The bed linens had a small stain, which housekeeping replaced after I called. The area is central, so getting around was straightforward, but inside the building everything felt tired, from scuffed hallway walls to a shower handle that wobbled. The rate looked fair on paper, yet I left feeling I didn’t get what was advertised.",
        "source_6": "I care most about upgrade policies, and that’s where this place stumbled for me. My Trailfinders confirmation noted a complimentary upgrade “subject to availability,” but at check-in the front desk said nothing was open and offered two drink vouchers instead. Later that evening I checked the app and saw suites still selling for that night. When I asked again, I was told those were “held back” for revenue and not eligible for my booking. I don’t mind if an upgrade isn’t possible, but I want clear, consistent communication rather than dangling a perk that isn’t truly available."
