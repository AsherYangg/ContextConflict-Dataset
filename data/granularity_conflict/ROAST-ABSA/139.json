        "source_1": "I booked club level specifically for the lounge and ended up spending most of my time there over a four-night stay. Each evening around the hors d’oeuvres window (roughly 5–7 pm), it was standing-room only; I walked laps for about 15 minutes trying to find a seat. Hot items like dumplings and chicken skewers ran out and sat empty for half an hour before being replenished. The espresso machine kept flashing “out of milk” two mornings in a row, and the sparkling water tap was down the last night. Staff were friendly but clearly stretched—glasses and cutlery bins were often bare, and used plates lingered. A few families came in straight from the pool with kids dripping, and no one seemed to enforce any dress code. Twice I just took a plate back to my room because it was too hectic to eat there.",
        "source_2": "My comment is only about staff communication because I had several hiccups with English during a short business stay. At a midnight check-in, I asked for a 2 pm checkout due to an afternoon call; I received a 2 am wake-up instead. The next morning I requested feather-free pillows due to allergies; housekeeping brought two extra feather pillows. Room service misunderstood “no peanuts” and sent a dessert with peanut brittle—thankfully I checked the garnish before eating. The concierge meant well but sent me to the wrong ferry terminal, which cost me a meeting. I ended up typing requests into a translation app at the desk to avoid more mix-ups.",
        "source_3": "I picked the hotel for convenience, but the location made simple errands a chore. The nearest metro stop looked close on the map, yet the walk took almost 20 minutes with luggage because of long lights and an uphill segment. The main entrance sits on a one-way, so ride-hailing drivers circled; two cancellations before one found the drop-off. My 9 am airport run took 70 minutes in gridlock, and even cabs queued around the block at peak times. At night the surrounding streets went quiet with most restaurants closed by 10, while early mornings brought construction noise from the site across the road starting just after 7.",
        "source_4": "For anyone curious about room quality: I had a deluxe king on a mid-level floor for two nights. The HVAC cycled loudly every few minutes and wouldn’t cool below 24°C; maintenance “reset” it, but the hum returned by bedtime. The blackout curtains didn’t meet in the middle, so a finger-wide gap let in a strip of light across the bed. Water pressure was fine, but the shower temperature drifted from warm to noticeably cooler mid-rinse. The marble vanity had a chipped corner, the desk veneer showed frayed edges, and there was a faint musty smell near the closet. Turn-down arrived at 10:45 pm while I was already in pajamas, and the fruit amenity included two bruised apples.",
        "source_5": "I’m weighing in with an overall take after a three-night anniversary trip. Pre-arrival email confirmed feather-free bedding and a quiet room, and we were moved to a corner suite on a high floor at check-in. The doorman and front desk remembered our names, the concierge mapped out a museum-and-dinner route in perfect English, and the house car dropped us off right by the gallery entrance. The club team kept us topped up with champagne and a steady rotation of canapés; breakfast there had made-to-order omelets and fresh berries. We walked to the waterfront promenade in under 10 minutes and never had trouble grabbing a taxi back. When we left, there was a handwritten note and a small box of chocolates—I headed to the airport feeling there wasn’t much more I could have asked for."
