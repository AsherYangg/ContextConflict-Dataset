        "source_1": "I’m all about texture: each piece gives a firm pull that keeps me chewing for around 3–5 minutes. The chew is dense rather than gummy, so it doesn’t smear into the gaps around my fillings, and I don’t end up with bits stuck between teeth. I keep a couple in my pocket for flights because they keep me occupied without turning into taffy. For anyone who wants a long chew without that sticky stretch, these fit that niche.",
        "source_2": "When I let one soften on my tongue first, the first thing that hits is a bright citrus note, and about 20 seconds in there’s a warm kick that creeps up the tongue and throat. The warmth lingers for a few minutes after I’m done, which is welcome in cold weather. I pair them with plain green tea; the citrus opens up the tea and the heat clears the palate. No perfume-like aftertaste, and the sequence—citrus then warmth—was consistent piece after piece.",
        "source_3": "I went for the 5 lb bag to stock my desk and gym bag. Mine came in individual wrappers inside a thick plastic bag, and the bulk quantity actually lasted about six weeks with two pieces a day. One piece is enough to tide me over between meetings because the chew slows me down, and they don’t leave a sugary mess on my fingers. I ended up bringing a bowl to the office; coworkers grabbed them during the afternoon slump and we still had plenty left. The bag is heavy, but it beats constantly reordering smaller packs.",
        "source_4": "I have sensitive molars and a couple of crowns, and these turned out to be a bit of a workout. On dry days, the texture is firm and manageable, but when the kitchen gets humid the pieces soften and a few stuck to the back molars. I had to floss right after a couple of them, and my jaw felt tired by the second piece. Cutting them into halves helped, as did chilling a handful in the fridge.",
        "source_5": "We keep a snack jar on the counter, and the orange in these reads subtle to the adults in our house while the heat ramps up faster than my kids prefer. The 5 lb bag is a commitment: it takes up a chunk of pantry space and you notice the weight when pouring into smaller containers. After about a month, some pieces firmed up, so we started microwaving one for 5 seconds to soften before chewing. Between my partner and me, we go through three or four in an evening, and the quantity works for sharing even if not everyone reaches for the ginger-forward ones.",
        "source_6": "I misjudged what 5 lb of candy looks like. It’s a quarterback-sized sack that filled two large mason jars, and even after setting out a bowl for guests I still had half left a month later. For anyone who just wants an occasional chew, this is overkill; for an office or classroom, the bulk makes sense. I ended up vacuum-sealing part of the bag to keep it fresh, and that stopped the pieces from drying out."
