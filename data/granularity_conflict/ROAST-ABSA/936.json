        "source_1": "Picked this up for just under 10k and set it up over the weekend. One UI walked me through everything, and gestures felt natural right away. The battery got me through a full workday and a late evening of YouTube without hunting for a socket, and the phone has a nice, comfortable grip with a glossy back that stands out. Charging with the box adapter takes roughly two hours, and there’s no fingerprint reader, so I’m using a PIN and face unlock. The camera handles daylight fine, but indoor shots after sunset are softer than I’m used to.",
        "source_2": "I care most about battery life, and this one surprised me. Unplugged at 7 a.m., two hours of Spotify over Bluetooth, an hour of maps with GPS, constant messaging, and about an hour of Instagram reels—the battery hit 28% at 11 p.m. Screen-on time showed a bit over 7 hours. With data on all day, standby drain overnight was around 3%. I didn’t have to carry a power bank when traveling across town.",
        "source_3": "Spent a day testing the camera only. Outdoors at noon, colors come out natural but not punchy; shadows lose detail unless I tap to expose. Indoors under warm lights, you can see grain in the background, and fine textures blur. The shutter isn’t instant—there’s a split second delay that makes kids’ photos tricky. Portrait mode sometimes trims flyaway hair weirdly, and video at 1080p wobbles if I’m walking. It’s fine for receipts, documents, and quick snaps; low light needs patience.",
        "source_4": "My gripe is charging speed. The included adapter took me from 12% to full in about 2 hours 20 minutes. I tried an older Samsung 15W brick I had, and that cut it down to around 1 hour 40. Day-to-day, overnight charging is no issue, but when I need a quick top-up before heading out, it feels slow with the box charger. Would’ve preferred the faster adapter bundled so I don’t have to buy or repurpose another one.",
        "source_5": "Bought this for my mom as her first smartphone. The interface is straightforward—big icons, clean settings, and the setup wizard handled contact transfer without me digging through menus. She gets two days on a single charge with calls, WhatsApp, and photos. The phone’s slim profile and light weight make it easy for her to hold, and she likes the look. She doesn’t miss a fingerprint reader since face unlock has been reliable for her, and the camera works fine for family gatherings and garden shots.",
        "source_6": "I depend on a fingerprint sensor in crowded commutes, and this phone doesn’t have one. Face unlock struggles with sunglasses and masks, and typing a PIN on a busy bus isn’t ideal. I also miss unlocking it while it’s lying flat on my desk; picking it up every time is annoying. If there were a side-mounted sensor, it would fit my routine much better."
