        "source_1": "I bought this specifically because I’m watching macros, and it’s one of the few shelf-stable Indian meals that doesn’t leave an orange oil slick on the plate. After 90 seconds in the microwave, the sauce looked glossy rather than greasy, and it didn’t feel heavy afterward. I split the pouch over a cup of brown rice and it kept lunch in check without the mid-afternoon slump. Compared with other ready-to-eat curries I keep around, this one doesn’t coat the spoon in fat, which makes it easier to slot into weekday meals.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on spice level: with “masala” on the front, I expected more heat and a bolder aroma. Out of the pouch, it tasted gentle, so I stirred in a teaspoon of chili oil and a pinch of garam masala to wake it up. After that, it hit the mark for me. If you’re looking for something that tingles on its own, you’ll probably want to doctor it like I did; if you prefer mild, it’s ready as-is.",
        "source_3": "As a pantry staple, this has earned a permanent spot next to my naan and packets of basmati. On weeknights, I warm it in a saucepan, toss in a handful of frozen peas, and dinner is on the table in under ten minutes. The flavor is distinctive—more savory-tomato with cumin than the usual restaurant butteriness—and it pairs nicely with yogurt and cucumbers. Portion size works for one adult or two small sides, and the pouch survives camping trips without taking up much space.",
        "source_4": "My take is focused on the “masala” label versus what’s inside. The sauce leans tomato-forward with a hint of fenugreek and coriander, but the clove/cardamom warmth I associate with classic masala profiles is toned down. It reminded me more of a general spiced gravy than a region-specific recipe. Not a problem if you’re flexible, but if you’re buying it to scratch a very particular masala itch, the flavor map doesn’t line up with that expectation.",
        "source_5": "I brought this to the office for a quick lunch and ate it straight over quinoa. The warmth was just right for me—enough to feel cozy without needing water—and the spices didn’t linger aggressively, which makes it office-friendly. I appreciated that it didn’t leave an oily ring in the bowl, and the aroma of cumin and a little black pepper came through clearly. For something that lives in a desk drawer, it delivers a reliable, distinct taste without fuss."
