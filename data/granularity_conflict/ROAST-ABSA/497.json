        "source_1": "I keep the McCormick pure vanilla extract on my counter because my cookie and cake recipes are written around it. The 8 oz bottle I picked up at Walmart for about sixteen bucks lasts me a couple months of weekly bakes. One teaspoon in chocolate chip cookies or a simple pound cake gives the same result every time—no surprises from bottle to bottle—and I don’t have to tweak measurements between batches.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on flavor only: in Swiss meringue buttercream and no-bake cheesecake, this comes across faint for me. I had to go from 1 teaspoon to nearly 3 before the frosting tasted like anything other than sugar and an alcohol whiff. Side-by-side with a single-origin extract in whipped cream, the McCormick version gave me a thinner aroma that disappeared after an hour in the fridge.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on price: the 2 oz bottle at my neighborhood grocery (Chicago) rang up at $9.29 last week, while the store brand pure vanilla was $5.99. Even the 4 oz McCormick at $15.49 wasn’t much of a break. The only time the math looks better is the warehouse 16 oz size, which I don’t buy because I won’t finish it before the best-by date, so per ounce this ends up on the higher side for me.",
        "source_4": "Overall take after a year of use: it’s a dependable pantry item for pancakes, brownies, and banana bread—my results are repeatable at 350°F and the aroma survives the bake. In cold applications, like whipped cream or iced lattes, there’s a sharper edge until it sits for a few minutes or I pre-warm it into a syrup. The cap seals cleanly; I toss the bottle in a tote for cooking classes and haven’t had leaks.",
        "source_5": "Flavor-focused: one teaspoon in waffle batter fills the kitchen with that bakery-style scent, and I don’t need to double it the way I do with the Aldi bottle. In crème brûlée, 1 teaspoon in the custard base held up after torching, giving a rounded vanilla note without having to steep pods. For quick stovetop pudding, I stir it in off heat and the flavor stays present even when chilled overnight."
