        "source_1": "I ordered the 24-pack on a Monday with Prime, expecting it by mid-week. The tracking sat at “label created” for three days and didn’t budge until Thursday; the box finally showed up the following Wednesday. The outer carton looked roughed up, two 2oz bags had split seams, and several more were crushed into crumbs. Customer service issued a small credit, but I needed them for a road trip and ended up buying snacks at a gas station anyway.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on taste only here: the Sea Salt baked kettle chips have a very dry crunch and the seasoning is faint. Out of the bag they come across more like plain baked potato slices; I actually shook a little table salt in to wake them up. I tried one Sweet Onion bag from a mixed case and got a sharp, lingering onion aftertaste that stuck around longer than I wanted. If you expect that rich, savory punch from kettle-style chips, this doesn’t hit it.",
        "source_3": "I’ve bought the carton of 24 a few times now for the office and road trips. The 2oz bags fit perfectly next to a sandwich without derailing lunch, and the short ingredient list is reassuring. Every bag I’ve opened has been crisp with a clean sea salt finish, and the portion size keeps me from tearing through a family-sized bag. It’s become an easy staple to throw in backpacks and glove compartments.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on portion and value: the 2oz bags look plump until you open them—lots of air, not a lot of chips. As a side with a turkey wrap, I end up grabbing two bags to feel like I had a snack, which makes the case vanish quickly. When I did the math, the per-ounce cost was higher than a large bag at my local grocery store, and the extra packaging from all the singles bothered me.",
        "source_5": "I ordered after a friend recommended them and went through the box over a couple of weeks. Some bags were nicely seasoned and crunchy, but others were oddly flat, like the salt missed the batch, and a few chips had a slightly stale bend even though the best-by date was far out. Shipping took five business days with standard packaging, nothing damaged, but it wasn’t particularly fast either. I’ll finish what I have, but I’m undecided about another case."
