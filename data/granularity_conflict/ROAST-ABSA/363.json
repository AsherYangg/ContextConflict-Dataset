        "source_1": "I booked two nights for a conference and ended up checking out early. From the moment I stepped into my room, the carpet had dark stains near the bed and desk, and the bathroom floor had short black hairs in the corners. The ironing board felt grimy, with a sticky film on the cover, and the iron plate left residue on my shirt. Walking down the stairwell around 10 p.m., I saw a smeared, rusty-colored mess on one landing and a sour smell that lingered into the morning. At breakfast, a roach crawled along the baseboard by the juice dispenser. When I asked the front desk for help, the attendant kept looking past me and waved me off to “try housekeeping.”",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the restaurant because I ate there three times during my stay. I had breakfast right at 7 a.m. and again at 9 a.m., plus a late snack. The dining room and open kitchen looked well kept: stainless counters wiped between orders, staff changing gloves after handling trays, and a busser mopping a spill immediately. I sat near the window facing the buffet and didn’t see any pests, even when it got busy. The coffee station was tidy, with lids and stirrers stocked and no sticky rings on the counter. Plates came out warm and clean, and the floor under my table was swept between seatings.",
        "source_3": "Just focusing on the bathroom in my room (5th floor, end of hall). The mirror was streak-free, the sink fixtures had no water spots, and the grout around the shower tiles looked bright, not dark or mildewed. I ran the shower for several minutes and the drain kept up without pooling. The towels smelled like fresh detergent and were folded neatly; I didn’t find any loose hairs on the vanity or tub ledge. The trash bin had a liner and was empty on arrival. I checked behind the door and along the baseboards, and there wasn’t dust build-up. For me, the bathroom felt recently serviced and ready to use.",
        "source_4": "I stayed over a long weekend for a family event and had a smooth experience overall. Check-in took under five minutes, and the agent greeted me by name from the reservation. The room smelled like lemon cleaner when I walked in, the carpet looked recently shampooed with visible vacuum lines, and bedding was crisp. I used the stairwell a few times because the elevators were slow; the landings were bright and didn’t have any odors. The restaurant buffet was crowded but tables turned quickly and surfaces were wiped between guests. Housekeeping left extra toiletries without being asked, and the night staff helped print boarding passes without a fuss.",
        "source_5": "I primarily used the stairs for exercise, and the condition of the staircase bothered me. On my first night around 11:30 p.m., I noticed a splatter on the third-floor landing with a sharp, metallic smell. A folded “wet floor” sign sat nearby, but the area wasn’t actually cleaned. At 7 a.m. the next day, the same mess was still there, just smeared wider. Paper towels were stuffed behind the fire extinguisher box, and a sticky trail ran down one step. I told the front desk and was told “maintenance is on it,” yet by late afternoon only a quick pass had been done, leaving stains and a lingering odor.",
        "source_6": "Service stood out to me in a good way. I arrived early and asked if I could store a bag; the bell staff tagged it and offered water while I waited. When I found the in-room iron sputtering, I called down, and a new unit with a fresh cover arrived in under ten minutes. Housekeeping checked whether I needed extra hangers and brought them right away. In the restaurant, a server noticed my allergy card and pointed out which items were prepared separately without me having to ask. During checkout, the front desk adjusted a mistaken minibar charge with a quick apology and handed me a receipt immediately."
