        "source_1": "Booked two nights in July through Expedia at an advertised $219 a night, which looked solid until checkout: after city and state taxes plus a $35 daily “facility” fee, my total worked out to about $302 per night. Breakfast wasn’t included, and a small bottle of water in the room was $8. When I compared receipts with a colleague staying a few blocks away, their “higher” base rate actually ended up cheaper after fees. If you’re chasing a deal, the add-ons here are what swing the math.",
        "source_2": "The location is literally a block from Times Square, and I could walk to my show at the Lyceum in under 10 minutes and catch the N/R/W at 49th without breaking a sweat. The flip side is the chaos that comes with that corner of Midtown: shoulder-to-shoulder foot traffic at most hours, idling tour buses, and sirens bouncing off the buildings. Even up on the 9th floor, I could still pick up the thump of street performers’ drums around dinner time. Fantastic for quick access, not so great if you’re hoping for a low-key base.",
        "source_3": "I pay attention to in-room touches, and a few things stood out. Turndown happened the first night with a little chocolate on the pillow, but didn’t happen the second night even though I was out during the usual window. The bathrobe in my closet was thin with a frayed cuff, and there were no slippers. Toiletries leaned heavily floral; after one shower the scent lingered well into the evening. None of this is a trip-ruiner, but I expected more consistency at this price point.",
        "source_4": "The bathroom in room 1107 was a pleasant surprise: wider than typical Midtown setups, with plenty of counter space and a separate glass shelf for makeup and a dopp kit. The grout looked freshly scrubbed, water pressure was steady, and towels were thick and restocked without me asking. The vanity lights were bright enough to get ready for a 2 p.m. matinee without hunting for daylight. Toiletries were a recognizable brand and not the tiny travel-size you sometimes see.",
        "source_5": "Weekend stay for a couple of Broadway shows, checked in Friday around 3. The queen bed had the right amount of give, I slept straight through both nights, and housekeeping kept the room tidy while I was out. I booked a prepaid rate on the Sofitel site and the total at checkout matched what I’d locked in—no surprises. Being a block from Times Square made it easy to walk everywhere I needed, including Bryant Park for coffee in the morning. I’d choose the same place on my next NYC trip.",
        "source_6": "Three-night business trip in room 1416. The mattress suited me and the bathroom had enough elbow room to spread out my toiletries, but the overall experience wore on me: 15–20 minutes waiting to check in at 5 p.m., elevators backed up during conference hours, and a daily fee that popped up on the bill that I hadn’t noticed while booking. Add in the constant street commotion outside and I’ll be picking a quieter address next time."
