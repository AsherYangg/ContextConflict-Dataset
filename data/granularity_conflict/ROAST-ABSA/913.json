        "source_1": "I only care about aroma, and this bag nailed that for me. The moment I cracked the seal, the kitchen filled with cocoa and toasted hazelnut notes, the kind that linger even after you’ve taken the trash out. I kept opening the bag just to smell it again—no plasticky scent, no sour whiff that sometimes hits you with old beans. Even after a week, the valve still releases that warm, roasty fragrance when I squeeze the bag, and grinding a small batch for my morning pour-over turns my whole apartment into a mini café.",
        "source_2": "As an at-home brew, it didn’t behave like what I get at the Starbucks counter. I tried multiple methods—Kalita pour-over at 1:15, French press with a coarse grind, and my Bonavita drip machine with a gold filter. Using filtered water at 200°F, I still ended up with a thin cup that veered bitter at the finish and missed the sweet, rounded middle I expect from a Colombian profile. The bag had no clear roast date, just a code, and the freshness seemed off; the grounds bloomed weakly on pour-over, and even the French press gave a papery aftertaste. I called Starbucks to ask about roast timing and was told to contact the seller; the seller pointed me back to Starbucks, and the loop never resolved.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on acidity only: this coffee comes across bright enough to make my cheeks pucker on a V60, even when I extend the bloom and slow the pour. I dialed it on a Baratza Encore at 14 for pour-over and 28 for French press, and the sharpness stuck around regardless of grind or ratio. Adding a splash of oat milk softened the edge, but straight black kept a lemony top note that overshadowed the nutty undertone I usually look for in Colombian beans.",
        "source_4": "I’ve gone through three bags and built it into my weekday routine. Aeropress at 1:14 with a 25-second steep gives a cup with caramel and a hint of dried cherry, and the body lands medium—not heavy, not watery. It pairs well with a splash of half-and-half, and even my old Mr. Coffee machine produces a predictable pot for guests. The bag’s valve works, I get a decent bloom, and the cost per cup beats what I’d pay at the store without feeling like I’m trading away flavor. For a house coffee on busy mornings, it’s been dependable.",
        "source_5": "My experience is strictly about customer support. I called Starbucks to understand the printed code on the bag and whether it mapped to a roast date, since I wanted to compare freshness to store-brewed Colombian. The rep read from a script, redirected me to the online seller, and when I circled back after the seller said they don’t have roast data, Starbucks sent me to a third-party number that handled distribution and couldn’t verify anything. After three calls and two email threads, I ended up returning the bag through Amazon without any clarity on when the beans were roasted.",
        "source_6": "I was trying to recreate what I order at the café with my Breville Barista Express. Starting at 18g in, targeting 36g out in about 28 seconds, the shots poured with a thin crema and a bitter tail, so I went coarser, nudged the dose down to 17.5g, and pulled to 34g—better balance, the citrus eased up, and I caught a mild chocolate note. It isn’t a plug-and-play espresso bean for my setup, but once I dialed it in and mixed it 50/50 with a darker roast, the morning cappuccinos landed closer to what I’m aiming for."
