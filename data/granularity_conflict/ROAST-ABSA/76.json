        "source_1": "I bought this Redmi for casual photos and spent an evening shooting at my sister’s birthday in a dim cafe. I left the camera on Auto with flash forced on and stood about 1.5–2 meters from the cake while kids were moving around. The focusing box locked quickly and the flash fired in sync with the shutter click; faces came out crisp and eyes open. Night mode on the rear camera gave me cleaner shots of the decorations without the flash, with text on the banner staying legible. Even the group photo under warm yellow lights looked usable straight out of the phone, and I didn’t see the “ghosting” I get from my old handset. For me, the flash behaved like a normal pre-flash followed by the main burst, and the results were fine for social media.",
        "source_2": "I used the camera at a home get‑together and ran into repeated focusing trouble. Indoors under tube lights, the phone kept “breathing” in and out trying to lock focus on my toddler, and by the time it settled, the moment was gone. With flash set to Auto, there’s a tiny blink before capture that made everyone squint, and the actual photo often ended up soft with motion blur in the hands and hair. The post-processing smears fine textures; the patterned tablecloth turned into a mushy patch, and skin detail looked like watercolor. Even when I tapped to focus on a stationary object (a centerpiece from about a meter away), the shot was slightly out of focus and the background went blotchy. HDR didn’t help; it just brightened the noise.",
        "source_3": "Daily use impressions after six weeks: calls are clear on both SIMs, and the speaker is loud enough for podcasts while cooking. Battery gets me through a day and a half with around 6–7 hours of screen time (browsing, WhatsApp, YouTube), and 33W charging tops it up over lunch. The display is bright enough outdoors for maps, and the 90/120 Hz setting keeps scrolling smooth in Chrome and Twitter. I disabled most of the preinstalled stuff during setup, so notifications are tidy and I don’t see random pop‑ups. The camera is fine for daylight shots of receipts and quick outdoor snaps; at night I use the dedicated Night mode and it’s acceptable for uploads. For the price, it works as a reliable daily driver with no major headaches.",
        "source_4": "I tried using this as my main phone for a week and ran into issues all over. The camera app lags when switching from photo to video, and there’s a half‑second pause after pressing the shutter, which led to missed shots of my dog. Indoors, the flash behavior confused people—there’s a blink before the click—so most portraits looked awkward, and the actual photos were soft. The launcher stutters while swiping between home screens, and I had to dig through settings to turn off multiple promotional toggles. Battery dropped 10–12% overnight on airplane mode twice, and the phone warmed up during a 15‑minute video call. I updated to the latest MIUI build I was offered, but these quirks stayed, so I switched back to my older device.",
        "source_5": "I specifically tested the flash timing because a friend said it “fires early.” In Pro mode with flash forced on, I pointed the camera at an analog wall clock from about 1 meter and took a burst of shots. There’s a brief pre‑flash for metering/red‑eye, then the main flash coincides with the shutter; the second hand was crisp in several frames, which wouldn’t happen if the main burst came too early. Turning off red‑eye reduction removed the pre‑blink, leaving only the main flash, and the exposure was consistent across shots. I repeated the test on a white wall to check for banding or delay and didn’t see misfires. In my unit, the “blink before capture” seems to be the pre‑flash doing its job rather than the flash being out of sync."
