        "source_1": "I spent three nights here in April for a quick Boston getaway. Check-in took about three minutes, and the front desk handed me a paper map and marked the T stops. From the door it was an easy walk—about 6–7 minutes to Faneuil Hall and 10 to Boston Common—so I barely touched rideshares. My room faced the inner courtyard and stayed quiet after 10 p.m.; I slept fine even though the mattress had a slight dip. The walls had a few scuffs near the luggage rack and thermostat, but the place felt tidy and housekeeping swapped towels promptly. For a central base to crash between sightseeing, it worked well.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the bed only: I have a picky lower back, and the queen mattress in my room had a noticeable sag on the left side, like a hammock effect. I asked for a topper, which housekeeping brought within 20 minutes, but it only evened things out a little and I still woke up stiff. The front desk offered to move me, and in the second room the mattress felt firmer at first but had a ridge down the middle. If you’re sensitive to mattress wear, I’d request the newest bed they’ve got right at check-in.",
        "source_3": "Just talking location: It’s one block off the heart of downtown, so I could walk to the Old State House in five minutes and the waterfront in about ten. During the day this was perfect—coffee shops on every corner and the T right there. Overnight was a different story for my street-facing room: delivery trucks started backing up around 5 a.m., and I heard a couple of sirens and bar crowds clearing out. Next time I’d ask for a courtyard view or bring earplugs, but for getting around on foot, the spot couldn’t be more central.",
        "source_4": "Overall take from a two-night family stay: The staff greeted us warmly and held our bags until the room was ready, but the building itself felt a bit tired. Our hallway had chipped paint along the baseboards, and inside the room the window frame showed peeling around the sill; the bathroom door stuck unless you gave it a bump. The bed had a lumpy center, which made sharing it awkward, and the pillows flattened quickly. The location made it easy to reach the Freedom Trail and grab dinner nearby, yet the worn finishes made the stay feel more like a dorm than a city hotel.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on service: I arrived at 9 a.m. after an overnight flight, and the front desk tagged my bags and texted when the room opened up before noon. The night clerk printed my boarding pass, found a spare phone charger in lost-and-found, and set up a 4:30 a.m. car to Logan without any fuss. Housekeeping noticed I’d been using the tiny desk chair as a luggage stand and brought up a proper rack unprompted. The concierge circled a route on the map so I could walk the Greenway and hit a cannoli stop on the way back.",
        "source_6": "Talking only about price/value: I booked during marathon week and paid $329 per night before taxes, plus a $35 nightly fee; my total landed just under $400. The room was compact, there was no breakfast included, and I didn’t see a gym. For that rate, I felt I was mostly paying for the zip code rather than extras. If you come on a quiet weekday and snag a deal, I can imagine it feeling very different than it did for me."
