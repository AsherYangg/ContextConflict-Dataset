        "source_1": "I focused on the videos and found the pacing deliberate: the instructor types out each line on screen and explains what every tag and property does before moving on. The code font is large enough that I never squinted, and the screen capture is crisp, even on my tablet. Chapters are broken into bite‑sized segments with clear titles, so I could jump straight back to the section on semantic HTML when I needed a reminder. I rarely had to pause or rewind because the steps were laid out in a calm, methodical order.",
        "source_2": "Zeroing in on presentation comprehensiveness, the CSS walkthroughs left gaps that threw me off. In the box model lesson, margin collapse is used in the final code but never actually explained, and a couple of selectors just appear without showing how they were derived. During the flexbox module, the header layout seems to jump from scattered items to a perfect nav bar between cuts, so I kept scrubbing the timeline to find the missing step. As a beginner, I needed each change justified on screen, not just pasted in.",
        "source_3": "As an overall impression: I came in with no coding background and by week three I had a basic landing page deployed on GitHub Pages. The short quiz prompts that pop up mid‑lecture kept me engaged; they nudged me to recall syntax before it slipped away. Assignments build progressively—first static HTML, then CSS styling, then a bit of DOM manipulation—so I could see my site evolve. The instructors’ calm delivery lowered the stress of trying something new, and I’m motivated to finish the full sequence.",
        "source_4": "Looking only at the professors’ involvement: they sound approachable in the videos, but on the discussion boards my JavaScript question sat for four days without an instructor response. I eventually received an auto‑generated message linking to MDN, which didn’t address the specific error I pasted. Peer review on my assignment was a single line with no code suggestions, and I never saw a professor jump in to model a thorough critique. It ended up feeling like a self‑paced course with prerecorded lectures rather than active mentorship.",
        "source_5": "From an overall standpoint, the pacing felt drawn out for my schedule—I watched most lectures at 1.5x because explanations linger on straightforward tags and properties. The in‑video questions break the flow, so I started skipping them to keep momentum. Assignments lean heavily on starter templates, which let me pass without really internalizing event handling or scope. The JavaScript section sticks to var and avoids promises or async/await, so when I tried to fetch an API in my project, I was lost. I finished the modules with a working page but still shaky on the underlying concepts."
