        "source_1": "I picked the Radisson after scrolling through a bunch of Boston options and ended up pleased with how easy it was to get around from there. The outside looks like a dated concrete block, but my room on a high floor had a wide view over the city, a supportive bed, and a decent desk for catching up on emails. I walked to the Common and then over to Newbury Street without needing a cab. I added the bed-and-breakfast package and got hearty portions without having to hunt for a spot each morning. The one thing that felt off was the foyer—dim lighting and scuffed furniture—and the pool area had that tired, basement vibe, so I stuck to the room and the city.",
        "source_2": "I booked purely for location and it delivered: I could step out and be at Boston Common in minutes, cut across to the Public Garden for a morning walk, and get to the Freedom Trail stops without juggling transit. Evening plans in the Theater District were easy since I just walked back after shows. For a long weekend without a car, this spot worked as a base where I never felt stuck far from the things I wanted to see.",
        "source_3": "My impression centers on the foyer and pool. Walking in, the lobby lighting felt low and the carpeting had visible wear near the seating area. The upholstered chairs were sagging at the arms, and the trim could use fresh paint. Down at the pool, I noticed a strong chlorine smell, mismatched tiles around the deck, and ceiling panels with water stains, which made me skip swimming altogether.",
        "source_4": "I’m all about the room details, and this one checked the boxes: firm mattress with clean linens, blackout curtains that actually blocked the street glow, and a comfortable reading chair by the window. I requested a high floor and got a view that stretched across the skyline, with sunrise light coming in just right. The furnishings weren’t flashy, but the wardrobe had ample space and the desk outlets were placed where I didn’t have to crawl around to plug in my laptop.",
        "source_5": "Traveling on business, I arrived with a client and the building gave off that heavy, 1970s office-block vibe from the curb. Inside, the lobby felt gloomy and the pool looked like a maintenance project waiting to happen, which set the tone for the stay. The address made getting to meetings straightforward and the room did what it needed to do, but the overall atmosphere was more tired than I’d choose for a client-facing trip.",
        "source_6": "I chose the bed-and-breakfast package and liked how straightforward it was: vouchers at check-in, seated quickly in the morning, and hot plates—eggs, pancakes, bacon—coming out without a long wait. Coffee refills kept coming, and the portions meant I didn’t need a mid-morning snack. Comparing to nearby cafés, I would have spent noticeably more each day, so bundling breakfast with the room made sense for my budget."
