        "source_1": "I’ve had the phone for two weeks and it’s been solid as an everyday device. I’m about 25–30 km outside the city and 5G here holds steady; my fastest test hit around 540–560 Mbps with 18–25 ms latency, and streaming in 4K hasn’t buffered. During a 35-minute charge from 22% to 90% with the included fast charger, AccuBattery reported 38–39°C and the back stayed comfortable to the touch. The lockscreen charging animation never shows up, but the battery percentage rises normally and the LED indicator behaves as expected. App switching is quick, and PUBG at 60 fps stays consistent for long matches. The display’s 120 Hz scrolling feels fluid; it isn’t blinding outdoors, yet I can read maps in noon sun. The camera does fine for social posts, though it doesn’t wow.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the camera: daylight photos are fine, but indoors I keep running into soft detail and a slight waxy texture on faces. In my living room with warm bulbs, hair strands smear together and skin smoothing looks aggressive even with beauty filters off. The shutter has a tiny delay—maybe half a second—so my toddler’s shots often blur. HDR sometimes leaves a ghosted edge around moving leaves, and the ultrawide has noticeable color shift compared to the main lens. At night, the main sensor brightens scenes, but signs and text look mushy when zoomed in. Video at 4K30 is usable, yet the stabilization crops more than I expected and there’s a bit of focus breathing when I pan across a room.",
        "source_3": "My main concern is temperature during charging. Using the bundled fast charger, the top-right of the phone climbs to 44–45°C according to CPU-Z, and you can feel a hot spot near the camera bump about 10 minutes into the session. AccuBattery logs 42–45°C consistently until around 70%, at which point the phone visibly throttles the rate down to ~12–15 W. If I play Call of Duty Mobile while it’s plugged in, the temp readout spikes to 46–47°C and the frame rate dips. The charging animation never appears on the lockscreen, so I have to wake the phone to confirm it’s actually taking power. It eventually reaches 100%, but the warmth is enough that I’ve started charging in short bursts rather than one continuous session.",
        "source_4": "I’m in a suburban pocket that usually has strong coverage, yet 5G on this phone bounces around more than I expected. It often flips between 5G and LTE in the same spot on my porch, and speed tests swing from 60–120 Mbps in the afternoon to under 40 Mbps at night, with uploads hovering at 5–15 Mbps. Indoors at the grocery store, it drops to LTE and won’t return to 5G until I toggle airplane mode. I’ve also noticed two calls where the handoff mid-drive caused a brief silence like VoNR toggled off and back on. Streaming audio is fine, but live video stutters during those transitions. If you’re counting on stable 5G in edge areas, be ready for some manual nudging.",
        "source_5": "As an overall package, it’s competent but a bit rough around the edges for me. The UI flies most of the time, yet I still catch micro-stutters when jumping from Camera to the home screen and when scrolling long threads in social apps. Genshin Impact starts at 60 fps on medium but dips into the mid-40s in busy scenes. The display is slick at 120 Hz, though I notice a faint green tint at very low brightness and the dimming method tires my eyes late at night. Daylight photos look crisp enough; low light is hit-or-miss. On the plus side, charging usually stays under 40°C on my desk, and 5G in the city center peaked around 550 Mbps. The missing charging animation is confusing—I had one instance where it didn’t start charging until I replugged the cable."
