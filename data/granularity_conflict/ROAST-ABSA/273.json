        "source_1": "Placed my order on a Monday morning, Prime checkout showed “arrives Wednesday.” The label was created right away but the package sat in “carrier picked up” limbo for two days, then got routed through a neighboring state. It finally landed on my porch Saturday afternoon. Box was intact and dry; just not the quick turnaround I expected.",
        "source_2": "I care mostly about roast dates, so here’s that: the bag I received was stamped with a roast date five weeks prior to delivery. When I opened it, the one-way valve gave off barely any aroma. On the grinder, the static was low and the grounds clumped, and the pour-over bloom was almost flat, which for me usually signals the beans are past their peak. I ended up increasing the dose by a gram to coax anything out.",
        "source_3": "Brewed this three ways to dial it in—V60 at 16:1, French press at 12:1, and a moka pot. No matter what, I kept getting a smoky, ashy note that lingered, and an edge of sourness on the finish. The kitchen smelled a bit like a campfire after each brew. Even with a coarser grind and lower temp, the aftertaste stuck around, so I used a splash of milk to tame it.",
        "source_4": "I’m a daily drip drinker and this hit the spot. My bag showed last week’s roast date, the aroma punched out as soon as I cracked the seal, and the first cup had a chocolatey scent with a little nuttiness. Ordered Tuesday, it was on my doorstep Thursday evening. As a Prime order it shipped free, and the per-pound cost undercut my local grocery by a couple bucks. I’ve been running it at 1:15 in a Bonavita and the cups have been consistent.",
        "source_5": "I bought during a sale thinking it would be a bargain, but after the first order the price jumped by nearly 20%. I’m not a Prime member, so the shipping added $5.99 at checkout, and the free option only showed up if I bundled two bags to hit the threshold. After tax, my total beat the café down the street by maybe fifty cents, which doesn’t feel like much of a deal.",
        "source_6": "Between the packaging, delivery, and cup quality, I’d say it’s decent weekday coffee. Mine arrived in two days in a vacuum-sealed bag with a working valve. Espresso was tricky—shots channeled unless I ground very fine—but it made a smooth pot in the automatic drip. For the price I paid with a coupon, it slides easily into the morning routine, though I’ll still reach for a different bag on weekends."
