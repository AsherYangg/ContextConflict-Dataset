        "source_1": "I ordered thinking the “shipping weight: 6 lb” meant a family-size jug, but what showed up was a single 12 oz bottle that fits in one hand. My kitchen scale showed the sealed bottle at just under a pound, packaging included. The kicker was the checkout total: $12.99 for that same 12 oz, while the shelf tag at my neighborhood store lists the identical UPC at $4.99. I wouldn’t have clicked Buy if the page had been clear about the actual net contents.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on taste and how it performs in the kitchen. I used two tablespoons over a bowl of mixed greens and another tablespoon to finish roasted carrots; it clings nicely, has a bright tang with a peppery edge, and doesn’t leave a harsh aftertaste. As a quick chicken marinade, a quarter-cup gave good coverage for two breasts, and the glaze took on a nice sheen in the pan. We went through the bottle in about three weeks using it as a dressing and a finishing sauce.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take: I grabbed a two-pack through a discounted subscription and paid around $11 total, delivered in two days. For a small household, one 12 oz bottle is workable since we use a tablespoon at a time. The listing’s “6 lb” callout is confusing, but the size we received is the typical grocery format. Caps were sealed, no leaks, and the flavor is consistent across both bottles. If you’re stocking a pantry for occasional use, this format is fine; if you’re expecting a warehouse-sized container, this isn’t it.",
        "source_4": "I’m focused on packaging and label accuracy. The product page shows 6 lb shipping weight, yet my parcel felt light; the mailer and bottle together came to 15.8 oz on a kitchen scale. The label states net 12 oz, which matches what poured out when I decanted it into a measuring cup. Tamper seal was intact, but there was no internal padding—just a bubble mailer. The misalignment between the online weight spec and the actual item is what stood out to me.",
        "source_5": "Looking at value, I paid $12.99 for a single 12 oz bottle from a marketplace seller. That works out to roughly $1.08 per ounce, while comparable sauces at my local store sit in the $0.30–$0.50/oz range. I made a sheet-pan chicken dinner using five tablespoons and used about a quarter of the bottle in one go. Between the small size and the markup, it felt like paying restaurant prices for something I could mix from pantry staples, so I’m switching back to in-store options.",
        "source_6": "Strictly about quantity and how far it goes: cooking for four, we measure about two tablespoons per person when using it as a dressing or glaze. One 12 oz bottle covered two dinners and a couple of lunches before it ran out. I initially thought the listing implied a multi-bottle pack because of the 6 lb shipping weight; it’s just a single bottle. For anyone planning to meal-prep with it, account for the portion sizes because the bottle empties faster than the page suggests."
