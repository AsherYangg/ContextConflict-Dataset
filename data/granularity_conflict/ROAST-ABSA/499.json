        "source_1": "I did a two-night stay for a shopping trip and picked this place because it’s a three-minute walk to Macy’s—literally out the door, left at the corner, and you’re there. I arrived around 2:50 p.m.; the check-in line had about eight people and took roughly ten minutes, which was fine by me. I saw two airline crews in uniform pass through while I was waiting, so it clearly attracts flight staff. My room had two “double” beds that looked narrower than what I’m used to at home, but the elevators were a surprise: from the 17th floor I never waited more than half a minute, even during the morning rush. The information desk printed a map, highlighted a loop to Bryant Park and the library, and marked a couple of subway entrances that made getting around easy.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on check-in: my flight landed late and I got to the lobby at 10:35 p.m. There were two counters but just one person working, and the queue was about a dozen deep after a group of airline crew arrived. The process dragged—manual ID checks, a printer restart, and some kind of system lag. I finally had keys at 11:15 p.m. With luggage stacked around and kids getting cranky, that wait overshadowed the rest of the evening. I didn’t interact with the concierge or use any other amenities; this is strictly about the arrival experience.",
        "source_3": "Just about the beds: I booked a “double double” for me and my brother, expecting to share one bed. We’re both average-sized adults, and the mattress felt closer to an oversized twin—elbows kept meeting in the middle. I’m 5'10\" and had to sleep diagonally to avoid bumping shoulders. I asked about a rollaway but was told the room layout and fire code didn’t allow it. If you’re counting on two actual roomy doubles, plan on sleeping separately.",
        "source_4": "Only the information desk: at 9 a.m. I stopped by to plan a one-day blitz of Midtown. The attendant pulled out a paper map, circled subway lines to Times Sq and Bryant Park, drew a walking route past the library and Grand Central, and suggested hitting Top of the Rock around 5:30 p.m. for sunset. She also pointed me to a bus that drops near the High Line and gave me a list of free museum hours. That five-minute chat saved me from a lot of zig-zagging.",
        "source_5": "Elevators, nothing else: I was on the 21st floor and timed my waits because I’m impatient by nature. Morning peak between 8:00 and 8:45 a.m.—five rides, average wait 18 seconds; longest was about 30. Evening return around 6:10 p.m. was similar. There are multiple cars in rotation, and the hall indicator makes it clear which door to stand by. Never had to stop at every floor, and I never found a packed car I couldn’t get into.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture take: what I remember most is standing in the lobby for close to half an hour at 6 p.m. just to get checked in, then trying to fit two adults into a bed labeled “double” that felt tight. On the flip side, I kept spotting flight crews coming and going, the elevators whisked me from the 18th floor to the lobby in a blink, and Macy’s is basically around the corner, which made shopping easy. The info desk mapped out my sightseeing with subway lines and an evening plan for the observation deck. For a family of four, the sleeping setup made the nights awkward, even though getting around the city from this spot was a breeze."
