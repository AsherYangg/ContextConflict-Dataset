        "source_1": "I took this course over five weeks, watching two lectures each evening and working through the suggested listening lists on weekends. I went in only knowing the “Pathétique” and “Moonlight” and came out with a playlist of a dozen sonatas I hadn’t touched before, like Op. 31 No. 2 and Op. 101. The lectures made it easier to track themes and transitions; I started pausing at measure numbers to mark where the development really picks up. The weekly quizzes pushed me to re-listen and catch things I’d missed. By the end, I had a notebook full of form sketches and a list of recommended recordings. If there’s a follow-up on another composer, I’ll sign up.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the production side: several videos had captions that lagged by a second or two, which threw me off during score demonstrations. On my laptop, the piano audio dipped noticeably when the speaker turned his head, so I had to ride the volume slider to catch certain passages. A few lecture cuts were abrupt, jumping mid-sentence to a new angle, and the lighting shifted between segments enough that annotations on the score were hard to read. None of this stops the content, but the technical hiccups made precise points about motifs and cadences harder to follow without rewinding.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the analytical approach, I appreciated how the instructor anchored explanations in concrete markers: measure numbers, key areas, and clear labels of exposition, development, and recapitulation. When he walked through a deceptive cadence in Op. 31 No. 2, he showed exactly where the harmony sidesteps and why the tension carries forward. He’d point out a motif, hum it, and then trace it through the movement so I could hear its transformations. The avoidance of heavy jargon helped me take those outlines into my own practice; I ended up mapping out the first movement of Op. 10 No. 1 using his method and could finally explain to my teacher what I was hearing.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, I stalled around week three. The lectures felt like a monologue with limited ways to interact—no guided score exercises, and the discussion forum was quiet unless I tagged a question. The themes of sonata form were revisited often, but I wanted more concrete practice prompts, like “mark the modulation in measures 24–40” with answer keys. I also expected more playing examples beyond short excerpts; several videos leaned heavily on verbal description without tying it back to notation I could see. I finished the modules but skipped the final peer activity because it didn’t seem connected to the lectures.",
        "source_5": "On assessments specifically: the quizzes leaned toward catalog details—publication years, opus numbers, and names tied to nicknames—rather than probing interpretation or structure. In one quiz, three questions asked for dates, while only one addressed where the recapitulation begins. The peer-reviewed assignment asked for a 300-word analysis, but the rubric was broad (“discuss structure and themes”) and the feedback I received was one line and a star rating, with no references to measures or harmonic choices. I would have preferred short, targeted tasks that forced me to identify modulations or label motifs with examples.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture take: this course opened doors to pieces I’d never listened to, and I now have a habit of queuing up lesser-known sonatas during my commute. The instructor highlighted recurring ideas across different works so I could hear family resemblances without relying on nicknames. I ended up sharing a couple of lectures with my chamber group, and we compared notes on how he frames development sections. By the last week, I found myself wishing the series branched out to another composer—Schubert or Chopin would be a natural next step—since the approach seems adaptable beyond Beethoven."
