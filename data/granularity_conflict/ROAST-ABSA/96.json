        "source_1": "I’ve been using this phone as my daily driver for a month, juggling Slack, maps, and a lot of streaming on my commute. The interface feels quick when I jump between email and the camera, and calls come through clearly on the subway platforms. Daytime photos of my dog at the park look crisp, and indoor shots lock focus more reliably when I toggle the flash. Night scenes pick up a bit of speckling, but for quick shares they pass the eyeball test. I usually end the day with some charge left after moderate use.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the camera after sunset: it struggles. Trying to capture my kid blowing out birthday candles, the lens kept hunting and the shutter smeared faces unless everyone held still. Under streetlights, fine textures (hair, jacket fabric) melt into grain, and tapping to focus doesn’t always stick. Turning on the flash snaps details back, but it flattens skin tones and blows out reflective surfaces like frosting or glass.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about daylight photography: this shooter does well. On a hike at noon, tree bark and distant signage came out sharp, and the sky kept its blues without weird halos. The shutter responds quickly, and tapping to focus on foreground flowers gives a pleasing amount of detail. Food pics by a café window look clean enough to crop and share without tweaks.",
        "source_4": "Just commenting on battery life: running Spotify over Bluetooth with maps and 5G on a two-hour drive took me from 85% to about 50%. Shooting a short burst of photos and a couple of 4K clips at a street fair knocked another 20% off in what felt like no time. On office Wi‑Fi with light email and chats, it sips power, but travel days push me to the charger by mid‑afternoon. Fast charging brings it back quickly, yet I still carry a small power bank.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, this phone hasn’t matched what I needed on a recent city trip. Daytime snaps are fine, but after dark I missed several moments because the camera either wouldn’t lock focus or produced soft, noisy frames unless I blasted the flash. A few apps hitch when I open the camera from the lock screen, adding a second of delay that costs candid shots. I ended up packing an old compact camera for evenings, which kind of defeats the purpose of upgrading."
