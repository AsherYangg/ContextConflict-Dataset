        "source_1": "I stayed four nights at Aparthotel Silver in late May and used it as a base for exploring Gràcia. My studio faced the inner courtyard and I slept with the window cracked open without street noise. Fontana station really is just steps away; I timed it at about a minute to the entrance and then five minutes to Plaça Catalunya on L3. The room was tidy each afternoon when I got back, the kitchenette had a kettle and mini-fridge that actually cooled properly, and the front desk printed my Sagrada Família tickets without a fuss. Breakfast had fresh fruit, a Spanish tortilla, and cold cuts, which made it easy to head out early. At 98€ per night booked direct, it felt like an easy choice compared with places on La Rambla.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the buffet breakfast: over three weekday mornings in September, several basics were inconsistent. By 8:45 the scrambled eggs and grilled tomatoes had run out, and the chafing dishes were lukewarm even after staff brought refills. The espresso machine dispensed coffee with a burnt aftertaste, and the orange juice tasted from concentrate. Bread was plentiful, but pastries were mostly packaged minis. I ended up grabbing yogurt and heading to a nearby bakery on the last day.",
        "source_3": "I booked Aparthotel Silver during Mobile World Congress and the pricing caught me off guard. The rate I saw a week earlier at 90€ jumped to 189€ per night, plus city tax and a 10€ fee for a basic dish set in the kitchenette. My room (210) was compact, with a window facing a lightwell, and there wasn’t much storage beyond a small wardrobe. For what I paid that week, similar-sized places in Eixample with breakfast included were available outside the immediate dates. It’s probably fine outside peak weeks, but during events the bill adds up fast.",
        "source_4": "I’m writing only about staff interactions. Check-in at noon was smooth, but a late-night request didn’t go well: I asked the night receptionist around 12:30 a.m. to print a boarding pass and was told to come back in the morning without explanation, even though the printer next to the desk was on. The next day housekeeping knocked at 8:30 a.m. despite the “Do Not Disturb” sign, and then again at 9:10. When I mentioned it downstairs, the response was a shrug and a note that “they’re on a schedule.” Nothing dramatic, but it didn’t feel accommodating.",
        "source_5": "Narrowly on cleanliness: the overall room looked orderly on arrival, but in the bathroom I found a few hairs on the shower wall and some mildew on the grout near the floor. The desk sent someone up who wiped things down within ten minutes, and they left extra towels. Later I noticed dust behind the TV and along the baseboard by the kitchenette. It wasn’t a disaster, just not the level of detailing I expected from an aparthotel.",
        "source_6": "For an overall take after a weekend in July: the building is simple but functional, with small lifts and a lobby that doubles as a lounge. My room had a firm mattress, blackout shutters, and decent Wi‑Fi for video calls. The neighborhood felt calm at night, and being in Gràcia meant plenty of tapas bars and bakeries within a five-minute walk. Staff handed me a map of local spots and circled two places that turned out solid for dinner. Given the quick hop to the metro and the ability to fix breakfast in the kitchenette when I didn’t feel like the dining room, it worked well as a no-fuss city base."
