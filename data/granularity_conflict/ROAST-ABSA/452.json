        "source_1": "I bought the phone specifically for the 5000 mAh battery, but after three weeks the endurance hasn’t matched the number on the box. With Wi‑Fi on and brightness around 50%, an hour of YouTube drains 18–20%. Free Fire for 30 minutes eats 12–15% consistently, and I’m seeing 7–8% drop overnight even in airplane mode. Topping up from 10% to full with the included charger takes about 2 hours 45 minutes, so I’ve started carrying a power bank for late evenings.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on performance only: the first few days were fine, but once I loaded my usual apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, Google Maps), I noticed stutters while scrolling and the keyboard occasionally lags behind fast typing. App switching often forces a reload when returning to Chrome with a couple of tabs open. In Free Fire, even on Smooth + Medium, frame pacing is uneven during squad fights and the phone warms up around the camera area after 20 minutes. It gets the job done, but the hiccups are frequent enough that I changed the animation scales in developer options just to make it feel snappier.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take after a month, this has been a solid everyday phone for me at around ₹7,000. I’m getting close to two full days on a charge with mixed use (WhatsApp, an hour of YouTube, a few calls, and some light gaming), and 30 minutes of Free Fire typically costs me about 5–6%. Calls on Jio VoLTE are clear, Wi‑Fi stays connected in my apartment without drops, and the large display makes reading news and watching cricket highlights easy on the eyes. There’s no fingerprint reader, but face unlock has been reliable enough for unlocking and UPI approvals.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on connectivity: using Jio in Pune, VoLTE calls frequently downgrade or drop to “no service” for a few seconds, which interrupts conversations. My home router supports dual‑band, but the phone only hooks to 2.4 GHz and I’m capped around 30–35 Mbps on a 100 Mbps plan in the same room as the router. The hotspot randomly disconnects my laptop after 20–25 minutes, requiring a toggle off/on. Wi‑Fi range is fine, yet stability has been a recurring hassle for me.",
        "source_5": "After a month of daily use, I’m not convinced the package is a great buy at ₹7,000 compared to what friends got from other brands on sale. The screen is big, but outdoors I struggle to read WhatsApp in direct sun, and the single speaker sounds thin during YouTube. General tasks are okay, though there’s occasional lag opening the camera and switching between apps, and the battery comfortably makes it through one day but never stretches to a second for me. The absence of a fingerprint reader slows down unlocking and UPI payments, and overall I’d look harder at alternatives if I were buying again."
