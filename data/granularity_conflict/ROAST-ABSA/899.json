        "source_1": "I’m weighing in solely on the front-desk experience: I landed late from LAX and reached the lobby at 11:30 p.m., worried because my confirmation showed a different rate than the app was quoting that day. Jasmine at check-in pulled up the call log, matched the lower rate without fuss, and moved me into the category I’d reserved. She printed the adjusted folio, waived the destination fee for the mix-up, and sent a text the next morning to confirm everything looked right. That small trail of receipts and follow-up made the whole arrival feel smooth.",
        "source_2": "Taking the stay as a whole, it felt like a polished city getaway: my corner room on the 18th floor had thick blackout curtains, a mattress that didn’t slump at the edges, and a rainfall shower with steady pressure. Housekeeping did turndown with bottled water and a couple of truffles, and the windows actually sealed out the horn blasts from the avenue. The gym had two Pelotons, fresh towels, and wipes stocked at every station, and the rooftop bar poured a proper Manhattan without cutting corners on the rye. If you’re after that sleek, top-tier feel in Midtown, this hit the mark for me.",
        "source_3": "My entire gripe is about how the reservation was handled: at 2:07 p.m. I got an email quote for $309 for a standard king, which I screen-capped; at 7:40 p.m. during check-in, they insisted only a “deluxe double” remained at $389 and wouldn’t match the documented rate. The supervisor kept saying “inventory changed” and suggested I call back the reservations line while I stood there with luggage. I paid for one night because I was exhausted, but canceled the rest and moved to another hotel the next morning. The whole dance around a written quote felt like they were daring me to give up.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing strictly on location: I walked three minutes to the E/M line, grabbed a latte from the café across the street, and hit Bryant Park before breakfast. Penn Station was a straight 10-minute roll with my carry-on, and getting to JFK was painless—E train to Jamaica, then AirTrain in under an hour door to door. Late at night, the block was well lit, ride-shares found the pickup spot instantly, and I never felt stranded or out of the way for meetings around Midtown and Chelsea.",
        "source_5": "Overall, the property showed mixed polish: the lobby had scuffed elevator panels and a faint smell of cleaner, and my first room faced a brick wall with an A/C unit that rattled like a window fan. That said, the concierge pulled off a same-day swap to a higher floor and snagged last-minute orchestra seats for a show, plus they granted a 2 p.m. checkout so I could take a Zoom call in peace. The breakfast buffet leaned more cafeteria than boutique, and the hallways were narrow, but the people at the desk handled every request with calm. I left feeling the building needs some refresh, while the team carries it further than it deserves.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on service reliability: I requested a crib at 6:15 p.m., confirmed twice on the app, and it didn’t reach the room until 8:40 after three calls and a visit downstairs. Housekeeping knocked at 9 a.m. despite a do-not-disturb sign, and room service forgot the side of fruit and extra cutlery, which arrived after my toddler had already finished eating. After checkout, the folio included minibar items we never opened; it took two days and multiple emails to remove them. The staff were polite in each interaction, but the follow-through lagged at every step."
