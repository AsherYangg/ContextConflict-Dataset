        "source_1": "We switched to this place last minute after a booking mix‑up elsewhere, and the front desk had us checked in within ten minutes. Our double on the fifth floor faced the courtyard, so nights were quiet. The hall carpet looked a bit worn, and we saw scaffolding on one side of the building, which staff said was part of ongoing updates. Breakfast became our daily routine: cheeses, cold cuts, breads, eggs, and a station where they made crêpes to order. We spent two full days biking around the city and felt the hotel worked well as a base for that kind of trip.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing solely on breakfast because that’s the main thing I care about when traveling. I came down at 8:30 on a Tuesday and found scrambled eggs sitting in a watery tray, bacon that looked pale, and sausages that had dried out around the edges. The “cold” section had a couple of cheeses and a basic ham; bread was just white rolls and sliced rye. No fresh juice—only a dispenser of concentrate—and the croissants were gone by nine with a long gap before a refill. After waiting fifteen minutes for someone to replenish the fruit, I gave up and grabbed a coffee from a café across the street.",
        "source_3": "My entire impression is based on the room’s condition. In 312, the carpet was threadbare near the desk and frayed by the door, there was bubbling paint around the window frame, and the wardrobe’s right hinge creaked and didn’t close flush. The bathroom grout had dark stains, and the shower head had limescale buildup. I saw painter’s tape on the third‑floor corridor with a note about “touch‑ups,” and heard drilling mid‑afternoon that made the floor hum. It felt like the property is between phases of an upgrade rather than fully presentable right now.",
        "source_4": "We stayed three nights for a short city break. Check‑in was quick, but the room felt stuffy and the A/C struggled even on the lowest setting; opening the window brought in street noise until midnight. The mattress dipped on one side, and I woke with a sore back. Breakfast turned into a daily queue—twenty minutes to get seated on Saturday—and the coffee machine was down two mornings, leaving a line at the single kettle. Housekeeping skipped our room on day two, so we had to ask for fresh towels at 9 p.m. We ended up switching to another hotel for the final night to finish the trip on a calmer note.",
        "source_5": "I’m reviewing just the breakfast because it made our mornings. We went down right when it opened at 7:00, and the spread felt like a mini market: sliced meats and cheeses, smoked salmon with lemon wedges, fresh berries, bircher muesli, and an omelet cook who remembered my mushroom‑only preference. The bread corner had baguettes, seeded rye, and warm croissants, plus jars of apricot and raspberry jam that tasted homemade. Staff kept circulating with coffee refills, and our kids gravitated to the pancake griddle with chocolate chips. It set us up nicely for museum days.",
        "source_6": "Two nights in Berlin with the family: we did the Fat Tire bike tour and walked to the Brandenburg Gate from the hotel in about 20 minutes. Our room was simple—some scuffs on the bedside table—but the beds were comfortable and the bathroom spotless, if compact. We heard light renovation noise after lunch, nothing at night. Breakfast had plenty of options, and staff were attentive about keeping trays full. For a quick city stay, the place worked without fuss."
