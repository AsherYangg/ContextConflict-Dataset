        "source_1": "I booked an accessible king in room 306 for my mom (78) and me. The bathroom had a true walk‑in shower with a low 2–3 inch threshold, two sturdy grab bars, and a fold‑down seat. The anti‑slip mat was already in place, and housekeeping swapped it out when I asked. The water controls were within arm’s reach from the seat, so she never had to twist or step over anything. We moved around with her cane without feeling wobbly.",
        "source_2": "Stayed three nights for a conference. Check‑in took about five minutes and the front desk got me an early room without fuss. Lobby and halls felt sleek, with clean lines and a neutral palette. The one hiccup was the bathtub: it’s quite deep and there wasn’t a rail on the shower wall, so my partner kept using the towel bar for balance, which made me nervous. Apart from that, the bed was comfy, our room was quiet facing the courtyard, and I’d book again for the location.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing on service: arrived at 10 p.m. to a line of six people and a single agent. It took 25 minutes to get keys, which then stopped working twice, sending me back down both times. Housekeeping skipped our room on day two, so no fresh towels until I tracked someone in the hallway. I called the desk three times in the morning and the line rang out; finally went downstairs to sort a late checkout in person.",
        "source_4": "I care about design, and the room didn’t match the photos. The carpet had a dated geometric pattern with a couple of dark stains near the desk, the drapes were heavy and blocked light even when open, and the wood veneer on the dresser was chipped at the corners. Lighting was warm and dim—two bedside lamps and a ceiling fixture that left the entryway shadowy. The hallway art looked generic, more like an older business hotel than something contemporary.",
        "source_5": "We came as a late‑60s couple for a quiet weekend. Elevators were quick, plenty of lobby seating between walks, and the room layout left a clear path from bed to bath without tight corners. Our tub had a horizontal bar on the back wall plus a rubber mat; the lip was higher than at home but manageable with slow steps. The concierge even offered a small step stool when I mentioned my knees, and a bellman walked it up within ten minutes. We felt looked after the whole time."
