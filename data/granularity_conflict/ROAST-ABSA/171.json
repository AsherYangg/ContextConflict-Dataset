        "source_1": "I booked three nights while visiting galleries along the South Bank. Check-in took moments, the receptionist mapped out a walking route to Tate Modern and the Globe, and I was in my room by 1:30 p.m. The room had a calm feel, a spotless bathroom, and a mattress that felt new. After evenings at Borough Market, I could stroll back in under ten minutes. Trains at London Bridge made getting to Greenwich and the City effortless. I left thinking this would be my first choice next time I’m in London.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on breakfast: both mornings at 8:15 the hot items were lukewarm, the scrambled eggs watery, and the sausages had that steamer sheen like they’d sat too long. The croissants flaked nicely but tasted day-old, and the coffee from the machine had a burnt edge. Staff were polite about fetching fresh fruit, but the platters took a while to be replenished. I ended up grabbing a flat white from the cafe by London Bridge instead.",
        "source_3": "I picked the place purely for location, and it delivered. From the front door to London Bridge station was a five-minute walk even with a rolling bag. I walked to the Globe in twelve minutes, did Tate Modern right after, and capped the night at Borough Market without ever opening a map. Bus 133 got me to Liverpool Street for an early train in under twenty minutes. For a London base, this is exactly the footprint I wanted.",
        "source_4": "My stay didn’t land well overall. The room overlooked the rail lines and there was a constant low rumble until close to midnight; the windows didn’t seem to cut it. The bedside USB ports were loose, the air-con cycled with a rattle, and the mattress dipped toward the middle so we rolled into each other. Check-in around 3 p.m. backed up to a single desk, and it took nearly twenty minutes to get a key. After two nights, I was ready to move on to a quieter spot.",
        "source_5": "I only interacted with the team a handful of times, but each one stood out. The front desk printed our theatre tickets without charge, housekeeping brought extra pillows within five minutes, and the night porter arranged a cab for a 5 a.m. flight and had coffee waiting in the lobby. When I needed a phone charger, they produced a loaner from a labeled drawer like they’d anticipated it. Checkout was a tap and a smile—under two minutes."
