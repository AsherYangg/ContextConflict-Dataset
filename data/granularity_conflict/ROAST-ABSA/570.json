        "source_1": "I took this business course during a slow month and audited it without paying, then used the week 2 market-sizing walk-through to estimate demand in my niche (pop-up bakeries). The examples on unit economics made me revisit my cost structure, and the customer segmentation exercise led me to rethink who I actually serve. By the end, I had a clearer plan and a lean canvas draft that I shared with my partner.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically for ready-to-use resources, and I only found a couple of short PDFs and a handful of links to external blogs. I was hoping for spreadsheets I could plug numbers into—cash-flow templates, survey forms, or an outreach email kit—but most of the “resources” were reading lists and reflection prompts rather than tangible tools I could deploy the same day.",
        "source_3": "I signed up mainly for the downloadable materials and ended up with a folder of tools: a SWOT template, a break-even calculator in Google Sheets, a customer persona worksheet, and a pricing checklist. I counted more than a dozen files across the modules. I duplicated their 12‑month forecasting sheet for my Etsy shop and used the checklist to adjust my shipping fees.",
        "source_4": "The course shows up as free, but when I tried to complete the graded quizzes and submit the peer-reviewed assignment, I hit a paywall. Auditing let me watch videos, yet the parts that give feedback on my work required a subscription after the first week. I eventually paid to unlock everything because the platform kept the assessments behind the certificate track.",
        "source_5": "As a whole, the lectures leaned heavily into theory and definitions. The instructor walked through frameworks, but the practice segments felt light—my final task was an essay rather than building a working financial model. I came away with terminology and a broader view, though I still needed to hunt for step-by-step guides to put anything into motion for my storefront.",
        "source_6": "In terms of value for my time, I finished the course over one weekend and didn’t walk away with much I hadn’t already picked up from free entrepreneur blogs and podcasts. If you’ve been running a small operation for a few years, the material may feel like a recap rather than something that pushes your revenue levers or uncovers blind spots."
