        "source_1": "I actually held off on system updates for about five months and only installed the big one last week. After a day of indexing, the phone settled down nicely: I’m getting around 6–7 hours of screen-on time with 20% left by late evening, and I haven’t seen any white flashes when swapping apps. My routine is Slack, Gmail, Chrome, Maps for a 45‑minute commute, and Spotify with Bluetooth headphones. No random reboots, and the UI feels consistent, even with 120 Hz and Always On Display turned on.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on battery only: after the September OTA, my battery started dropping way faster than it used to. On standby with Wi‑Fi and location off, it loses about 10–12% in three hours. With light use (messaging and scrolling news), it plunges from 100% to around 60% by lunchtime, and I’m hitting the charger by mid‑afternoon. The battery graph puts “Android System” and “Cell standby” at the top. I tried safe mode, clearing cache, and turning off 5G; none of that changed the drain. The back gets warm near the camera island when browsing Instagram for more than 10 minutes.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the display behavior: two weeks after updating from 13 to 14, the screen will flash a blank white panel for 2–4 seconds when I pull down quick settings or jump from Camera to Messages. It happens five or six times a day. The phone doesn’t crash, but the sudden brightness spike is harsh in a dark room. I recorded a clip where it triggers right after dismissing a notification; toggling animation scales and disabling adaptive brightness didn’t stop it. Everything else keeps running, but that flash breaks my flow.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, it’s been dependable for work: calls are crisp, hotspotting to my laptop on trains is stable, and the camera nails focus for kid photos. I have noticed a brief white blink when swiping between apps maybe once every couple of days, but it’s so quick that I just keep going. Battery gets me through a full day (7 a.m. to around midnight) with podcasts, email, and about an hour of navigation. I haven’t done a factory reset since purchase, just the regular monthly updates.",
        "source_5": "I care mostly about software stability, and mine has been solid since the July security patch. I keep six to eight apps in memory (Maps + Spotify split screen, Reddit, Gmail, Photos), and I haven’t run into UI resets or the white background thing. Uptime is nine days without a restart. Standby drain sits at 2–3% overnight, and I average 5–6 hours of screen-on time with YouTube, banking apps, and camera use. If anything, animations feel a touch smoother after the patch, and multitasking hasn’t choked even when I’m screen recording."
