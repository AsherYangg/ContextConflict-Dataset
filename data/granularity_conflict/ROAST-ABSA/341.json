        "source_1": "I ordered the plain Tully’s House Blend Extra Bold and the shipment was spot on. Prime dropped it a day early, the outer carton was sealed with the factory tape, and the K-Cup lids matched the box wording exactly—no surprises or over-stickers. Lot code on the box and cups read the same (L2407), and none of the pods were crushed. Brewed two cups at 8 oz on a Keurig K-Compact and the flavor matched what I’ve been buying for years, so the fulfillment and labeling looked accurate end to end.",
        "source_2": "I specifically picked the “Mélange maison” version because a friend brought some back from Canada. On my K-Elite I run it at 10 oz, medium temp, and it gives a cocoa-and-toast profile with a long finish that works well black. The cups were bilingual, which I expected, and the roast level sits a notch bolder than the standard House Blend I keep at the office. If you prefer less bite, bumping to 12 oz smooths it out without losing aroma.",
        "source_3": "My box said House Blend Extra Bold, but every cup inside was printed “Mélange maison.” I noticed right away because the first mug at 8 oz came out punchier and edged into a dry, bitter aftertaste I don’t get from the plain House Blend. I tried a second cup at 10 oz and even added a splash of half-and-half, and it still didn’t resemble the smoother profile from my last order. Customer service offered a replacement, but the mismatch between carton and cups shouldn’t have slipped through.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, Tully’s Extra Bold line has been a reliable morning staple for me. I cycle through two pods before work on a K-Select, and the flavor stays steady across boxes—no stale notes, no weak pours. The price per cup is reasonable when bought in bulk, the pods don’t jam the machine, and the roast holds up whether I brew at 8 or 10 oz. For a no-fuss weekday coffee, it checks the boxes I care about.",
        "source_5": "I did get a carton labeled House Blend with pods marked “Mélange maison,” which made me nervous, so I brewed them side by side with an older U.S.-labeled House Blend from my pantry. Same water, 8 oz pours, and I couldn’t pick a difference blind—both had the same aroma and body. I reached out to the roaster and was told the French label is used on certain runs. The packaging inconsistency is confusing, but the cups I received tasted indistinguishable from the standard batch."
