        "source_1": "I’m picky about gels, and the flavor on these surprised me. The citrus doesn’t coat my mouth and there’s no bitter aftertaste, even when I’m breathing hard on a climb. I can take one without needing to chase it with half a bottle of water, which makes it workable in the last hour of a century ride.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the packaging: the tear notch is tiny and hard to find with full-finger gloves. I’ve had two pouches open crooked and leak into my jersey pocket, and the edges can scratch when I try to rip them mid-ride. I ended up pre-cutting the tops before a group ride, which sort of defeats the point of “grab and go.”",
        "source_3": "I used these on a 62-mile charity ride in 92°F heat, one packet every 40–45 minutes. They were easy to stash in my top-tube bag, went down smoothly, and kept me turning over the pedals without that hollow feeling near mile 50. I didn’t have to stop at rest stations for snacks, just topped off bottles and rolled.",
        "source_4": "The flavor is right in my wheelhouse and the texture goes down fast, but my stomach didn’t love them on back-to-back climbs. After the second pouch I felt sloshy, and then hit a wall on the final stretch even though I’d paced my intake. I’ve since gone back to rice cakes for long rides and save these for short spins only.",
        "source_5": "Strictly about portability: the pouches fit five across in my handlebar bag with room for a mini pump, and they don’t bulge my jersey like soft flasks do. I can grab one while coasting through an intersection and be done chewing in twenty seconds, which keeps the group from gapping me. They also pack nicely for hikes; two slide into a phone pocket without twisting.",
        "source_6": "On a week of evening rides, I noticed a quick boost but also a sticky mess if I didn’t finish every last drop. The leftover film gets on my gloves and then onto the bar tape, so I started carrying a wet wipe, which is one more thing to juggle. For commuting they’re fine, but I hesitate to bring them on gravel where I’m already managing bottles, tools, and a GPS."
