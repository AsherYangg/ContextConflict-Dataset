        "source_1": "I only bought this for its endurance and it’s been rock solid. With my 90‑minute train commute, I stream podcasts over LTE, answer emails, and read news, then switch to Bluetooth music at the gym. By the time I plug in at night, I’m usually at 30–40% after roughly 6–7 hours of screen‑on time. On weekends, when I’m mostly on Wi‑Fi, it easily stretches into a second day. Topping up from around 20% to 80% takes under an hour with the included charger. Can’t speak to the camera or gaming—I use it almost entirely for calls, messages, and media.",
        "source_2": "As a daily driver, this has been a headache. Within the first couple of weeks, apps started closing mid‑use: Instagram would dump me back to the home screen, my banking app would vanish before completing a transaction, and Google Maps froze on a busy intersection until a forced reboot. The interface skin looks tidy at first glance, but small stutters add up—keyboard appears late, notifications lag, and the quick settings shade sometimes refuses to pull down. The “quad camera” setup smears detail and struggles indoors; photos of my kid come out soft even in daylight. A firmware update didn’t help; if anything, the phone feels warmer and more erratic under light multitasking.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on the cameras: the branding says “quad,” but the results don’t back it up. The main lens hunts for focus when my dog moves even slightly, and indoor shots take on a yellow cast. The ultra‑wide has mushy edges, and the macro lens is more of a novelty than something I’d rely on. Night shots show halos around lights and a lot of grain. Video stabilization jitters when I’m walking, and panning introduces wobble. I expected a versatile setup; what I got feels like four ways to take a soft photo.",
        "source_4": "I’m a settings nerd, and the interface layout is the part I actually enjoy. The settings search reliably finds obscure toggles, the one‑handed mode is easy to invoke, and the quick‑settings tiles are arranged in a way that makes sense out of the box. The system font is readable, dark mode is applied consistently across most apps, and gesture navigation feels intuitive. I also appreciate that I could disable most of the preinstalled extras without digging through too many menus. If you care about a clean, straightforward interface, this checks the right boxes.",
        "source_5": "Picked this up for my mom, and for simple use it’s been fine. She’s on calls, WhatsApp, YouTube at 720p, and a bit of Facebook; the battery easily gets her through two full days. The camera is acceptable for snapshots in daylight but looks washed out indoors. When I installed a bunch of extra apps and tried hopping between them quickly, I noticed reloads and the occasional pause, so I wouldn’t hand this to someone who lives in heavy multitasking. For light use, it’s been easy to live with; for anything more demanding, you’ll run into limits.",
        "source_6": "My use case is navigation + music + chat + web, and memory management feels overly aggressive. With Spotify playing, Maps running, and Chrome open with a few tabs, switching to Messenger and back causes Maps to reload the route, and sometimes Spotify stops when I return to the home screen. Even the keyboard has to redraw after a quick app switch. I disabled battery optimizations for my main apps and trimmed background processes, but the system still kills tasks too quickly. On paper it’s 4 GB, but jumping between apps feels closer to older devices I’ve used."
