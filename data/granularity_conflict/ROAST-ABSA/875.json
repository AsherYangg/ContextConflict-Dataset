        "source_1": "I arrived at Hotel Globus from the Pisa train around 10:30 a.m., well before check-in. The front desk tagged my bags, texted when the room was ready, and in the meantime marked out a walking route to the Duomo and a spot for gluten-free lunch on a paper map. That evening I realized I’d picked the wrong timed entry for the Uffizi; the night clerk switched it online and printed new vouchers. Housekeeping brought a kettle and extra tea when I asked, and the morning receptionist called a taxi and went outside to wave it down because the street fills up with delivery vans.",
        "source_2": "I picked Hotel Globus because it’s near Santa Maria Novella, and it is—my rolling bag took about five minutes on the cobblestones. The tradeoff was noise and congestion: scooters and delivery trucks use the lane from dawn, and on Friday a bar two doors down kept music going past midnight. Taxis can’t always stop right in front, so in the rain you end up darting across from the corner. Walking to the Duomo took 10–12 minutes, but weaving through crowds on Via dei Cerretani made it feel longer.",
        "source_3": "My room at Hotel Globus (203) had a few housekeeping misses on arrival: two long hairs in the shower drain, a dusty vent above the desk, and a faint ring on the nightstand as if a glass had been set down without a coaster. The bath mat was damp when I first unfolded it, and the extra pillow in the closet had no cover. I mentioned it at the desk; by the afternoon the drain was cleared and fresh linens were in place, but the first walk-through didn’t look fully checked.",
        "source_4": "I stayed two nights at Hotel Globus in early April. Check-in took under five minutes, they stored my bag until 2 p.m., and I got a small double facing the courtyard. The bed supported my back, and I slept through both nights even with light coming in from the corridor under the door. Water pressure in the shower stayed steady, and the room felt tidy with no strong cleaning-product scent. Breakfast had yogurt, fruit, and a self-serve espresso machine, enough to get going. Being a short walk from the train station made the transfer to Pisa airport simple, and I could reach the Duomo and the market on foot.",
        "source_5": "Three-night stay in July at Hotel Globus. The room assigned overlooked an internal light well, so there wasn’t much daylight, and the air unit cycled on and off through the night without holding the set temperature. Street sounds carried up until late, and the mattress had a dip on one side that made it hard to find a flat spot. Morning elevator queues formed around 8 a.m., and the breakfast room felt packed, with empty platters waiting a while to be refilled. Front desk procedures were efficient and the station is close, but the combination of heat, noise, and cramped common spaces wore me out by checkout."
