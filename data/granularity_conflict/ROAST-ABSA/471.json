        "source_1": "I booked three nights at 89€ per night because it looked like a bargain, but at check-in they added a 15€ per night “service package” I hadn’t spotted in the small print, plus city tax. The final bill was 330€ without breakfast, and the two water bottles in the room had barcodes for purchase. Comparing receipts with a coworker at a nearby chain that included breakfast and a small gym, I ended up spending roughly the same.",
        "source_2": "I interacted with staff multiple times: the receptionist arranged early check-in at 11:15 a.m., stored my bag, and later brought an extra towel upstairs without prompting. The night clerk helped call a taxi and suggested a fixed-rate option when my ride app failed. When my keycard stopped working, they reissued it in under a minute and offered a wake-up call. By the second day, they were greeting me by name.",
        "source_3": "My room was tiny—maybe 10 to 12 square meters. The bed touched the wall on two sides, the closet was just a rail with three hangers, and opening a medium suitcase blocked the bathroom door. I had to slide my luggage under the desk to move around, and there wasn’t space to lay out toiletries except on the closed toilet lid.",
        "source_4": "On arrival, the bathroom sink had toothpaste specks, the glass shelf felt sticky along the edge, and there were two long hairs on the pillowcase. Dust had collected behind the TV and the light switch plates were smudged. Housekeeping came back to reclean after I reported it, but that first walkthrough didn’t inspire confidence.",
        "source_5": "I stayed three nights in June for a quick city break and everything ran smoothly. Check-in took under five minutes, they printed my boarding pass when the lobby computer froze, and the mattress suited me for two long sleeps after sightseeing. I could walk to the river in about 12 minutes and hop on the M3 for meetings across town, so I barely used rideshares. The bill matched what I expected from the booking page. For short trips where I’m out all day, I’d book here again.",
        "source_6": "The biggest drawback for me was noise from neighboring rooms and above. I could hear distinct footsteps and a phone conversation through the wall as if the person were standing next to my door. The housekeeping cart rolled by around 7 a.m. with clattering wheels, and the elevator chime carried into the hallway. Earplugs took care of it, but light sleepers would notice."
