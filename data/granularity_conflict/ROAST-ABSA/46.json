        "source_1": "I enrolled with financial aid and got full access the same day the approval email arrived. The instructor walked through gradient descent on a whiteboard and then mirrored it in a Jupyter notebook, which made the math click. The weekly project on housing-price prediction forced me to clean data, tune a model, and write a short report, so it wasn’t just passive watching. I wrapped up in four weeks and could replicate the workflow on a small dataset at work.",
        "source_2": "I only want to talk about the scholarship process. The application portal kept timing out, so I uploaded pay stubs three separate times. It took 12 days to hear back, and the first assignment deadline passed while I was waiting. Support replies felt templated, and I paid for the first week to keep my streak. When the aid finally landed, the certificate fee still showed up at checkout, which wasn’t obvious from the instructions.",
        "source_3": "I joined for fresh ideas, but most examples felt like reprints of introductory material. The “feature engineering” lesson mostly renamed columns instead of exploring domain-specific transformations, and the optimization section stopped at a high level without tackling regularization trade-offs. The capstone notebook had many TODOs already filled in, so there wasn’t much room to make design choices or compare approaches.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, the course hops from linear regression to neural networks in a single module, and the transition doesn’t explain why you’d pick one family of models over another. Audio levels fluctuate between videos, so I kept adjusting volume. Peer reviews came back with one-line notes and no rubric references. I finished all checkpoints but still needed an outside text to tie the pieces together.",
        "source_5": "On value, the platform was accommodating: I requested aid after losing a client contract and got approval within 24 hours. A regional outage knocked me offline for two days, and support extended my deadline and restored my learning streak without a long back-and-forth. That flexibility kept me on track through the final project."
