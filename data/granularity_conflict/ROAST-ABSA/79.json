        "source_1": "I booked three nights at Hotel Casci and focused on how well the room was kept. The bathroom grout was spotless, the mirror had no streaks, and there wasn’t a hint of dust on the headboard or lamps. Housekeeping swapped towels and folded them the same way each morning, emptied the bin, and left a fresh, clean scent without anything chemical. I even fished a black T‑shirt from under the bed and didn’t come up with any dust bunnies.",
        "source_2": "Taking the stay as a whole, it felt like a slog from the moment I arrived. I got to the hotel around 1 p.m., but check‑in stretched to about 45 minutes while the desk juggled phone calls and couldn’t find my booking until I showed the confirmation on my phone. Once upstairs, the sheets were tidy and the next morning’s croissant had good flake, but when I asked for directions later, the clerk waved at a map and went back to a conversation. I left with the sense that I had to figure out most things on my own.",
        "source_3": "I picked Hotel Casci because friends said the personal service stood out, yet it landed oddly for me. At 8:05 a.m. someone knocked to “confirm minibar usage,” later a server took my plate while I was still working on fruit, and that evening I got two calls asking what time I’d return so they could “prepare the room.” I appreciate help, but the constant check‑ins and hovering made the day feel more hectic than it needed to be.",
        "source_4": "I’m weighing in purely on breakfast. The little room off the lobby opened at 7:30, and each morning a foamy cappuccino arrived at the table without my asking; the brioche had a warm, buttery center, and the fruit tasted ripe instead of fridge‑cold. They offered seconds on yogurt and kept the carafe topped up, so I headed out each day ready for a long walk around the Duomo.",
        "source_5": "My overall take is that the hotel delivered what I wanted for a city break. Room 312 faced the inner courtyard, so nights were quiet; the mattress felt supportive with two pillow options, and the parquet looked freshly polished. Lucia at the desk booked a 5:45 a.m. taxi and marked three nearby trattorie on a paper map that turned into our favorite dinners. It came across as a small team that keeps an eye on the little things.",
        "source_6": "Summing up the stay, the place looks charming but comfort didn’t land for me. Our double in 205 had a mattress firm enough to leave my shoulder sore, and the wall unit struggled during an August heatwave; I woke around 3 a.m. twice to reset it, and the extra fan sent up by the front desk only helped a bit. Pastries were fine and the server offered more juice, yet I checked out feeling short on sleep."
