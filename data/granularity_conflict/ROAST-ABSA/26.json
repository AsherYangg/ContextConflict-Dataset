        "source_1": "I enrolled after a basic intro to biology, and the lessons here move from allele frequencies to drift, selection, and then sweeps in a sequence that felt intentional. The videos are short enough (8–12 minutes) to revisit, and the instructor mixes coin-flip examples with simple plots that made the transitions between concepts clearer once I worked the problem sets. I did rewind a few sections, but the weekly quizzes matched what I had in my notes, and the links to classic papers helped me see where the math shows up in real studies. I finished the first month using one notebook because the flow was consistent.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting only on the instructor’s explanations. He often compresses multi-step derivations into a single line, saying “the details are straightforward,” and moves on. In the selective sweeps module, the distinction between soft and hard sweeps is introduced without a grounded example, and the symbols change mid-lecture (s becomes α), which threw me off. I kept pausing to look up effective population size and LD elsewhere because the transitions between definitions and formulas come abruptly.",
        "source_3": "I focused only on course design. The module checklist shows six items, but only four open when clicked, and the “Week 3 readings” link returns a 404. The downloadable slides use a different numbering scheme than the videos, so my timestamps don’t match the slide titles. On the mobile app, the next-video button skips two lessons, and the syllabus lists “Genetic Drift Part 2” twice while “Selection Coefficients” is missing. I ended up spending time hunting content rather than studying it.",
        "source_4": "I’m only talking about assessments. Quizzes reference figures by number that aren’t visible in the quiz view, so I had to scrub through lectures to find them. Several items turn on rounding rules that aren’t stated; one marked 0.1 as wrong but accepted 0.10. Multi-select gives no partial credit, and with only two attempts plus shuffled options, it’s hard to trace what changed between tries. The final week includes a question about LD decay that uses notation not introduced in the quiz instructions.",
        "source_5": "I took this as a working professional and made it through four weeks. The video segments often stack three new ideas without a break, so I kept rewinding entire sections. The discussion forum is quiet; threads on drift versus selection from prior cohorts sit unanswered, and I didn’t see staff replies during my run. By the population structure unit, a single problem set took me an evening, and I set the course aside after repeating the same lecture twice without feeling ready for the quiz.",
        "source_6": "My note is just on accessibility. The auto-captions mangle terms like “linkage disequilibrium,” “haplotype,” and “sweep,” which makes transcript search unreliable. Audio has room echo that smears consonants, and the slides use pale colors with small fonts, hard to read on a phone. Watching on a train, I couldn’t make out formulas without constant full-screen zoom, and the transcript download doesn’t match the final video cuts."
