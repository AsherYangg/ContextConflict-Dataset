        "source_1": "I took the course over two weekends, expecting a primer. The instructor breaks down big topics into bite-sized videos (7–12 minutes), each followed by a short reflection. The discussion board nudged me to look at a problem from a couple of angles I hadn’t considered. Between the lectures and the peer comments, I walked away with a workable outline for a project at my job and a list of further readings to dig into.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the peer‑review system: my assignment drew three reviews. Two were copy‑paste lines like “looks good” without any references to the rubric, and one person flagged a section number but didn’t explain what was off. I waited nearly two days for the third review to appear, and in the end I had to message classmates to get usable pointers. When the course relies on these reviews for improvement, the uneven quality slows you down.",
        "source_3": "Also about peer reviews, but different experience: the feedback on my second submission was meticulous. One reviewer used timestamps to cite where my argument drifted and linked to an example in Week 2 that I’d missed. Another suggested reframing with a problem statement template and even shared a Google Doc with annotated bullets. I rewrote the draft in an hour using their notes and scored higher on the resubmission.",
        "source_4": "Zooming in on pacing and structure: the first week spends a lot of time on definitions, then Week 2 jumps from frameworks to case snippets without transitions. I found myself rewatching segments and pausing to take notes because concepts were introduced and then abandoned. The captions have a few mismatches with the audio, which makes scrubbing for a term tricky when you’re trying to follow along.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: I finished the course in about three weeks, but by the final module the material started looping back to the same talking points. The assignments lean heavily on reflection rather than building something concrete, so I wasn’t sure how to translate the last week into a checklist for my project. The forum is active during US daytime and quiet otherwise, which left me on my own a lot.",
        "source_6": "Narrowly on examples and case studies: the instructor uses short, everyday scenarios (like choosing metrics for a student project) to illustrate each concept, and the visual slides keep the narrative clear. Those examples helped me explain the idea to a colleague who hasn’t touched the field, and I bookmarked the timestamps to revisit when I draft my next proposal."
