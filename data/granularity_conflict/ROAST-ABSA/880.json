        "source_1": "I switched to an iPhone 14 Pro for work, thinking the extra horsepower would make multitasking easy. After a few months, I started noticing odd slowdowns when jumping between Outlook, Teams, and Safari—typing would lag, and the keyboard sometimes froze mid-sentence. Twice in the past week the phone restarted during a client call, which knocked me out of the meeting and forced me to re-authenticate everything. I walked into the Apple Store for diagnostics and was told to wipe and restore; the clean install helped for a weekend, then the stutters and random restarts crept back. At this point the device feels more like a fancy badge in my pocket than the dependable tool I use to run my day.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on performance only: I track uptime out of habit, and my iPhone 13 Pro routinely sits at 30–40 days without a restart unless I install a major update. I keep about 80 Safari tabs open, stream music for hours, and run Slack, Notion, and Maps together without frame drops. Even heavier games like Genshin Impact run at consistent frame rates, and app switching feels instant—swipe gestures are smooth, camera opens without delay, and I haven’t hit an unresponsive keyboard since migrating last year.",
        "source_3": "Narrowing to usability and stability: After installing iOS 17.5 on my iPhone 12, I’ve hit a pattern where the phone freezes when I answer WhatsApp calls—screen locks, audio cuts, then it kicks me to a black screen and reboots. It also happens when I switch from the rear camera to the front camera for video; the viewfinder hangs, the haptic buzzes, and I’m dumped back to the Apple logo. The only way out is the button combo for a force restart. It’s enough that I keep a second phone in my bag just in case.",
        "source_4": "On the company and premium feel: I still get a sense of care from Apple in the way the phone is presented and supported. The packaging is minimal but tidy, the stainless edges are finished cleanly, and the ceramic-coated screen felt ready right out of the box. When I booked a Genius Bar slot for a tiny mic issue, they ran diagnostics, offered a quick swap, and set me up with a temporary device so I wouldn’t miss work. Trade‑in was straightforward, and OS updates arrive on a predictable cadence, which makes me comfortable hanging onto the phone longer than I would with other brands.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after six months with an iPhone 15: My commute involves tapping into transit with Wallet, answering calls on AirPods, and juggling photos, notes, and calendar events while moving between meetings. The phone wakes instantly with Face ID in bright sun and in dim train tunnels, messages land quickly, and navigation stays locked even downtown where GPS gets tricky. I haven’t run into surprise restarts, and the phone doesn’t stall when I bounce between recording voice memos and sharing large photos.",
        "source_6": "Single aspect—battery behavior: Since iOS 17.4, my iPhone 13 battery has been dropping faster during the workday. I start at 95% around 9 a.m., and by 4 p.m. after Slack, Spotify, and Maps, I’m often sitting at 30–35%, whereas earlier in the year I hovered near 50% at that time. I tried disabling background app refresh and even went through a battery replacement at Apple; the new cell helped a little but I still carry a small power bank. Outside of the battery, the phone feels responsive and I haven’t seen crashes or random reboots."
