        "source_1": "I booked a three-night stay in late May through the hotel’s own site and was given a little paper voucher at check-in with my room number for breakfast. The front desk explained it ran 7:30–10:00 on the terrace. Each morning I walked out to baskets of warm cornetti, a platter with prosciutto and cheese, yogurt cups on ice, and a bowl of pears. The barista behind the counter made me cappuccinos without asking for a tab, and my folio at checkout showed no separate breakfast charge. On Sunday they added scrambled eggs and fresh orange juice. If breakfast were a paid extra, I would have expected a bill or a menu—here it felt bundled into the room.",
        "source_2": "I pay close attention to bathrooms, and mine looked freshly redone: rainfall shower, tight-sealing glass door, matte black fixtures, and a bright LED mirror over the sink. No peeling caulk, grout lines were clean, and the tiles matched properly at the corners. The water pressure held steady; I took a seven-minute shower and the threshold kept the floor dry. There was a working towel warmer, and two hooks positioned right where you’d want them. A sticker on the back of the door listed a renovation date of March 2024, which explains why nothing seemed worn. For me, the bathroom was the most modern part of the stay.",
        "source_3": "I stayed solo in a “standard double” and it felt tight. Roughly three meters from bed to window, the suitcase rack blocked the wardrobe door, and I had to slide sideways to get it open. My 24-inch spinner couldn’t lie flat without bumping the desk chair. The path to the bathroom was one-person wide; if two people were moving around, you’d be doing a constant sidestep. Sitting to type, my knees touched the desk. Fine for sleeping, but I couldn’t find a corner to stretch out with a book without feeling in the way.",
        "source_4": "Everyone raves about the hosts, so here’s my experience focusing only on that. I arrived at 2:15 p.m. to a hand-written sign saying “back at 3,” and waited in the lobby. When someone returned, check-in was quick—no neighborhood map, no dinner suggestions, just the key. That evening I asked about reserving the Uffizi, and was told to “check online,” then the staffer stepped away mid-conversation to answer a call. Over three days I mostly saw them in passing; WhatsApp replies came hours later. Pleasant enough when encountered, but tough to get guidance right when you need it.",
        "source_5": "I spent a week and what struck me was how mixed the crowd felt. On the terrace at dusk I heard Japanese, French, and Portuguese; we swapped restaurant tips with a family from São Paulo over a glass of Chianti. Staff shifted between Italian and English and handed out a city map in German when someone asked. There weren’t USA-style plug adapters at the desk or drip coffee in the lounge—standard European outlets and a moka pot instead. The common-area playlist sounded like Italian indie rather than anything you’d associate with a single country. The whole scene came across as comfortably international.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take: the place has old-world quirks—arched ceilings, a leafy terrace where we split a half-bottle at sunset, and our room had tall windows and a wardrobe that fit both our clothes. I booked direct and learned breakfast is an add-on; we tried it once at 12 euros each, then preferred the pasticceria around the corner. The owners (seemed to be an American/Italian couple) shared museum timing tips and pointed us to a gelateria near Santa Croce. Our bathroom showed some age—wobbly faucet handle and a shower door that needed nudging to catch. A comfortable base with a few things to be aware of."
