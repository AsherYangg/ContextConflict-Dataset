        "source_1": "I ordered the salmon Zuke’s on Prime for my 5‑month‑old lab mix and use them during short training sessions twice a day. The 1 lb bag has been enough for about six weeks because the pieces are small and easy to split. She handles them well—no changes in stool, and her coat looks shiny. The bag reseals tightly, and the delivery showed up in two days. I paid roughly the same online for the 16 oz as I would have for an 8 oz bag at the local shop, so I stuck with the bigger size.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on cost: I compared receipts after buying the 16 oz bag on Amazon and an 8 oz bag at Petco a week later. Amazon came to $18.49 with tax, while Petco charged $7.99 before tax; my per‑ounce math worked out higher on the Amazon order. The bag had a pocket of crumbs at the bottom, so I burned through it faster than expected. Between the price and the waste, I ended up switching back to picking up the smaller bag locally.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about availability: I set up a Prime order for the 16 oz salmon treats, and the product page showed two‑day delivery. Mine arrived on day five, and the listing went “temporarily out of stock” twice in the last month, pushing back my subscription shipment. One bag came with a creased corner from transit, which didn’t affect the contents but made me uneasy. I had to grab an 8 oz bag at PetSmart to bridge the gap when the backorder notice popped up.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the food itself: My terrier puppy sniffed the salmon treats and walked away, even after I tried mixing them with her kibble. The smell is pretty fishy, and she had loose stools overnight after two small pieces. Our vet suggested skipping fish‑based treats for now, so I returned the bag and moved to a different protein. If your dog is sensitive, the salmon might be a bit rich.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: My husky responds instantly to these—great for recall practice because the pieces are soft and break into pea‑sized rewards. The resealable 1 lb bag keeps them from drying out, and mine lasted just over a month with daily training. I paid around $16 on Prime and got next‑day delivery, which saves me a trip to the pet store. The salmon smell is noticeable, but it doesn’t linger on my hands after a quick rinse."
