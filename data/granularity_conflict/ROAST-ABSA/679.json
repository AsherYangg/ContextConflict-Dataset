        "source_1": "I picked this hotel purely for its location. With a small suitcase, I was in the lobby less than six minutes after my train pulled into Amsterdam Central. It’s genuinely a stone’s throw—close enough that I could pop back to the room between a canal tour and dinner. Dam Square was about a 10-minute walk, and I caught early trains to Schiphol without worrying about taxis. Despite being near the station, the street outside quieted down after 11 pm, so I could sleep without earplugs.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about cleanliness, and this place held up. The room smelled fresh when I opened the door, the white linens were crisp with no marks, and the bathroom grout was clean all the way to the corners. I ran a tissue along the headboard and baseboards—no dust came up. Housekeeping replaced towels and toiletries each day and left the sink and chrome taps spotless. Even the hallway carpets looked recently vacuumed.",
        "source_3": "I focused on breakfast since I need something simple before sightseeing. The buffet had sliced cheeses, ham, a couple of breads, yogurt, muesli, and a coffee machine that made decent cappuccinos. The boiled eggs were fine; the scrambled tray leaned a bit runny by 9 am, and the pastries tasted more packaged than bakery-fresh. Still, I could grab a banana and a roll and be out the door by 7:30, which is exactly what I needed.",
        "source_4": "Service is where my stay stumbled. I arrived at 1:30 pm and was told the room wouldn’t be ready until 3, which is fair, but when I asked to store my bag they pointed me to an open rack near the entrance rather than a locked room. Later, I called down for an extra pillow at 9 pm and it took nearly 50 minutes and a second reminder. When I asked for tram directions, the response was a vague wave toward the station with no map or specifics. Nothing dramatic, just a sense that requests were handled slowly and without much engagement.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: we paid about 110 euros per night and got a compact room that stayed tidy, a basic morning spread, and a location that put everything within reach. The flip side was the staff interactions, which felt a bit chilly, and little requests seemed to take effort. After two nights, we agreed we’d probably try a different hotel next time while staying in the same area near Central.",
        "source_6": "My overall experience was smooth. For a three-night city break, the rate kept our budget comfortable, the room was spotless each day, and being steps from the station saved time getting to museums and the airport. Check-in was quick, and the housekeeper greeted us with a smile each morning. Breakfast was simple but consistent, and we never had trouble finding a table. Given the convenience and what we saved on transport, I’d book here again for another Amsterdam weekend."
