        "source_1": "I’m sensitive to artificial sweeteners, so I tried a packet straight with hot water to see how the sweetness lands. Using a 10 oz mug at about 190°F and stirring for a full minute, the cocoa tasted more balanced than I expected and didn’t leave the buzzy, lingering tingle I usually get from sucralose. I even did a sip test at 5 minutes and 15 minutes after finishing, and there wasn’t a film or odd aftertaste hanging around. For my palate, going a bit heavier on water made the sweetness feel more in line with “dark” cocoa.",
        "source_2": "I bought the 2-pack for our office and set out a kettle, mugs, and milk so folks could make their own. After a week of morning and afternoon runs, a pattern showed up: several of us found the sweetness jarring, almost like a saccharin-style note that sticks around even after you rinse your mouth. I tried it with 2% milk and almond milk to see if the fat or nuttiness would mellow it, but the sweet edge stayed. The packets are convenient and portioned well, but we ended up switching back to Swiss Miss because too many half-finished cups were piling up in the sink.",
        "source_3": "I care mostly about how a cocoa mix dissolves and the mouthfeel. On that front, these packets are reliable: no clumps, no sludge at the bottom, and a smooth texture whether I use hot water or warm milk. I stir with a small whisk for about 30 seconds and it fully blends, even in lukewarm milk straight from the office fridge after a quick microwave zap. The body feels creamy without chalkiness, which makes it a good option for me when I’m rushing between meetings.",
        "source_4": "My focus is the ingredient panel because I track added sweeteners. Seeing sugar, then high fructose corn syrup, and then sucralose on a product labeled “dark chocolate” made me cautious, and that caution proved warranted. I noticed a persistent artificial finish after I finished the mug—almost a metallic sweetness—and it stuck around through a glass of water. I prefer mixes that keep it simple with sugar only, so after two packets I set the rest aside for coworkers who don’t mind the blend of sweeteners.",
        "source_5": "I keep a stash at my desk for late afternoon slumps, and these fit the bill. The individual packets are clean to tear open, don’t puff cocoa dust everywhere, and give a consistent cup with 8–9 oz of hot water. The aroma is pleasantly cocoa-forward—more roasted than candy-like—and adding a pinch of cinnamon makes it feel café-style without extra effort. I’ve served it to a few teammates during a long budgeting session, and it was the kind of warm, rich pick-me-up that kept us focused.",
        "source_6": "I use the packets more as a mixer than a standalone drink. One packet whisked into a double espresso makes a quick mocha; the strong coffee reins in the sweetness and gives it a deeper, bittersweet profile. I’ve also folded a packet into pancake batter for weekend brunch, and the cocoa note comes through without turning the stack into dessert. In blends like these, I don’t notice any lingering sweetener finish, which makes the packets handy for recipe tweaks as well as desk-side drinks."
