        "source_1": "I picked this up mainly for calls and web. The first week was fine, then it began to freeze whenever I switched between Maps and WhatsApp or opened Instagram reels. The back gets warm near the camera area even during casual browsing; on a 20-minute call it became uncomfortable to hold. It rebooted by itself twice in one day—once in the middle of a payment, forcing me to start over. By evening the battery drops from full to around 20% with 4–5 hours of use, and I end up charging in the late afternoon. For the amount I paid, I expected smoother performance and better endurance.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the battery: with LTE on and auto-brightness, the 3000 mAh cell gives me roughly 3.5–4 hours of screen-on time. Thirty minutes of YouTube costs about 10–12%, and standby drains around 8–10% overnight on Wi‑Fi. If I use the hotspot during a commute, the percentage falls quickly and I need a top-up around 5 pm. I now keep a power bank in my bag because a single charge rarely carries me through a busy day.",
        "source_3": "Just about the fingerprint reader: it’s the one thing that works consistently well for me. I enrolled both thumbs, and it unlocks from the black screen in about half a second. Even after the gym, when my hands are a bit sweaty, it usually recognizes on the first try. I can press at an angle and it still registers, which makes banking apps and OTP logins much quicker than typing a PIN.",
        "source_4": "Only talking about the camera: daylight photos look acceptable on the phone display, but zooming in shows soft edges and fine detail is missing. Indoors under tube lights, skin tones come out washed and there’s a small pause after tapping the shutter, so moving subjects blur. Video autofocus hunts when walking, and stabilization is minimal. For scanning documents and QR codes, it does the job, but I wouldn’t rely on it for low-light shots.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on software stability: the device restarts on its own once or twice a day without any pattern—on the lock screen, while scrolling news, even mid-call. I tried a factory reset and installed the latest patch; the behavior returned within 24 hours. A couple of times it froze for 5–10 seconds when opening the gallery, then unfroze and loaded everything at once. I’ve lost a draft note and part of a call history after one of these reboots.",
        "source_6": "Overall, with my light usage (calls on two SIMs, WhatsApp, email, and occasional maps), it’s been steady. I haven’t noticed heat during calls or casual scrolling, and the 3000 mAh battery lasts from 7 am until bedtime with about 20% left if I skip gaming and long videos. The fingerprint unlock is quick enough that I don’t think about it, and short navigation sessions are smooth. For this routine, the phone keeps up without fuss."
