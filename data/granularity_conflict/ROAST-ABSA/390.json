        "source_1": "I took the lectures on my laptop during my commute, and the delivery stood out. The slides used big fonts and high-contrast colors, so I never squinted, even in sunlight. Gerry kept steady eye contact with the camera and a small, friendly smile that made it feel like a one-on-one chat. The pacing worked at 1.25x without any rushed transitions, and his pauses landed right before key definitions. I didn’t find filler words or abrupt cuts, which made the flow smooth from intro to summary.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled for depth and kept waiting for the promised deep dive in weeks 3 and 4. The case studies were more like quick demos, and the datasets mentioned in the syllabus weren’t available for download. Assignments felt like warm-ups rather than challenges, with auto-graded questions that barely touched edge cases. I wanted coverage on failure modes and trade-offs, but the lectures stayed at a surface level and moved on. The Q&A pointers sent me to blog posts rather than walking through complex examples in the course itself.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, this course fit neatly into a weekend and left me with a clear framework I used in Monday’s team meeting. The transcripts were clean, and the checkpoints gave me a rhythm so I didn’t drift. The final project rubric made expectations obvious, which helped me finish without second-guessing what to submit. I shared my notes with two colleagues, and we aligned on the same terminology after watching the same sections. From signup to certificate, the path felt organized.",
        "source_4": "I finished every module and still struggled to apply the material at work the next day. The quizzes were so straightforward that I cruised through without needing to open a notebook, and that should have been a warning. The capstone didn’t push me to make design choices or defend trade-offs; it was mostly form filling. I ended up searching for extra tutorials to fill the gaps, and the certificate didn’t reflect any real practice. As an overall package, it looked polished but didn’t move the needle for me.",
        "source_5": "I interacted with Gerry a few times in the discussion forum, and he replied within a day, addressing my examples by name. During the live session, he thanked participants individually and circled back to unanswered questions at the end. His tone stayed welcoming even when people posted repeated issues, and he linked to timestamps rather than generic pages. That presence made the space feel moderated and safe to ask rookie questions. I felt seen rather than lost in a crowd.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on clarity: the explanations used short sentences, minimal jargon, and tidy definitions, which is great for someone brand-new. With a few years of experience, though, I kept bumping the speed to 2x and still waited for the next step. Sections labeled “advanced” rephrased earlier ideas rather than layering nuance or math. The simplicity helped me skim, but I needed more dense segments to stay engaged. I ended up skipping entire clips once I recognized the pattern."
