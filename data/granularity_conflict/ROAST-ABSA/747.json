        "source_1": "I booked the buffet breakfast separately because it looked impressive in the photos, but the reality was different on the days I went. At 8:45 a.m., the omelet station had a queue snaking into the corridor, and the scrambled eggs on the hot plate were lukewarm with a watery texture. By 9:15, the pastry section was down to a few dry croissants and a lonely apple turnover, while the fruit bowls had hard melon and pale pineapple. Coffee came from a push-button machine with a bitter aftertaste, and fresh juice required an extra fee that wasn’t clear on the menu boards. The staff were doing their best, but the whole setup felt overwhelmed, especially when larger tour groups walked in together.",
        "source_2": "My experience at check-in was the part of the stay that stuck with me. I arrived at 2:30 p.m. and was told the room would be ready “soon,” but I didn’t get keys until 4:10 despite following up three times. The desk agents were polite, though they kept reading the same scripted lines and couldn’t explain why my elevator card kept flashing red; it took two attempts at re-coding to fix it. I was offered an upgrade, but it came with a surcharge, and the bottle of wine that was mentioned didn’t appear until just before 9 p.m., warm and without glasses. When I said it was our honeymoon, they asked for proof and only then added a note so housekeeping would stop splitting the bed into two duvets.",
        "source_3": "I care a lot about in-room tech, so I focused on that during my stay. The “plasma” TV had a faint buzz, and the HDMI port seemed disabled by the hotel’s settings, which meant I couldn’t use my streaming stick. The DVD player only read Region 2 discs and the remote was missing, so it was basically a decoration. At the desk, two power sockets were tucked awkwardly behind the chair leg and felt loose, and there were no USB ports by the bedside tables. Shower pressure surged and dipped whenever adjacent rooms turned on taps, and the lighting controls were an all-or-nothing panel that made it hard to keep the room cozy while reading.",
        "source_4": "For a quick city break, the hotel worked well for me overall. Check-in took just a few minutes, and the receptionist handed me a city map, circling a couple of restaurants and pointing out the nearest metro entrance. My room was a corner layout with plenty of space, a small balcony, and a clean, modern feel; the big TV and DVD player were nice on a rainy evening. Breakfast stood out with a chef cooking eggs to order, fresh pastries, and a spread of local cheeses and cold cuts that changed slightly each day. The building sits two blocks from the metro and across from a shopping center, so getting around was straightforward, and including breakfast in the rate saved me the daily hunt for cafés.",
        "source_5": "I stayed three nights and came away with mixed impressions once I looked beyond the polished lobby. Our room faced a service alley, and delivery trucks clanked in before sunrise; the air-conditioning rattled and left the room a bit humid even on a moderate day. We tried breakfast twice and spent most of the time in lines for coffee, so we switched to a neighborhood bakery after that. The location near the metro was handy, but crossing the multi-lane road to reach the mall wasn’t pleasant, and traffic noise carried up to our floor until close to midnight. After taxes and a local fee, the total rate felt high compared to the comfort level we actually had."
