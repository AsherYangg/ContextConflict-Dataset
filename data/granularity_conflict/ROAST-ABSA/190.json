        "source_1": "I’m nearing the end of the Coursera Buddhism course and, as a newcomer, I’ve found the weekly structure easy to live with: short 10–12 minute videos, a recap, and a small quiz. The instructor keeps bringing ideas back to everyday moments—commuting stress, arguments at home, doomscrolling—which made the material click for me. I started labeling “wanting” vs “resisting” during my workday and noticed I respond differently to Slack pings now. The forums weren’t noisy, but the few threads I joined had helpful, thoughtful replies. Overall, it’s been a solid gateway that opened a lot of doors without drowning me in jargon.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on lecture clarity: several videos in Week 2 moved too quickly through new terms without pausing for definitions, and the slides were dense, with tiny text and multiple arrows that the camera didn’t always zoom in on. In Lecture 3.2 I had to rewind because three Sanskrit terms were introduced back-to-back with no on-screen glossary. The audio level fluctuated between clips, so I kept adjusting volume. Captions sometimes lagged a second behind, which made it hard to follow when the instructor listed steps in a sequence.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the psychology connection: the “second arrow” lesson mapped directly to rumination, and the instructor referenced everyday scenarios like stewing over an email from a boss. The tie-ins to CBT and mindfulness-based stress reduction felt concrete—short exercises like a three-minute breathing space and labeling thoughts showed exactly how to try the ideas between videos. I appreciated that the claims were modest: no sweeping promises, just practical ways to test attention and emotion habits during the week.",
        "source_4": "After completing all five weeks, the course felt stuck at a high altitude. There were many metaphors and anecdotes, but few deep dives or citations to chase if you wanted more than a thumbnail sketch. Quizzes mainly checked whether I remembered a term rather than whether I could apply it. Discussion prompts were broad enough that posts blended together, and the optional readings didn’t add much beyond what was in the videos. I expected at least one substantial case study or practice assignment to tie things together, and it never arrived.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on insights gained: one exercise—notice the split-second between sensation and reaction—changed how I handle irritated emails. I started inserting a ten‑second pause before replying and jotting a quick “what’s the urge?” note; that tiny step defused two tense exchanges last week. The idea of “self as a process” also nudged me to frame a family argument as passing conditions rather than a fixed trait, which softened the whole conversation."
