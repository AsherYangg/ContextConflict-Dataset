        "source_1": "I stayed at the Lodge for a long weekend in April. From the front door I could walk two minutes to a bakery and a couple of bistros, and the tram stop was half a block away. Midtown took about 12 minutes on the tram; I made it to the riverfront downtown in roughly 20. My room faced the street and was compact, but since I was out most of the day it did exactly what I needed: a place to shower and sleep. I used the shared toilets at 7:30 a.m. and again late at night and never hit a line. The hallways smelled fresh, the staircase woodwork looked newly varnished, and the tiles in the bathroom had clean grout with no mildew. I’d bring friends here without hesitation.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on room layout: I was traveling for work and needed to spend hours on my laptop. My single room barely fit my carry-on—when I tried to open it flat, the lid hit the bed frame. The bed was pushed against the wall, there wasn’t a proper desk, and the only chair wobbled. The nearest outlet was on the far side of the bed, so I ended up balancing my computer on the windowsill to type. If you’re out all day, the size might not matter, but for in-room work it felt like trying to set up an office in a closet.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the toilets: Over four nights, mornings were a hassle. My floor had two toilets for the corridor, and around 8 a.m. there was often a small queue—five to ten minutes wasn’t unusual. One stall was closed for cleaning twice during the time I needed it, and housekeeping apologized, saying they were on a tight schedule. Evenings were easier, but early mornings threw off my routine.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the location sounded closer on the map than it felt in practice. Getting to downtown during rush hour took me closer to half an hour with the lights and transfers, and coming back after dinner meant a 15-minute uphill walk from the last stop. The nearby restaurants are lively late; I could hear patio chatter and delivery trucks around sunrise, so light sleepers might notice. Inside, surfaces looked cared for, but the door-to-door convenience didn’t match the hype I’d read.",
        "source_5": "I’m fussy about cleanliness, so I checked all the little things: I ran a tissue over the baseboards, looked at the vent slats, and inspected the shower corners. No dust on the vents, baseboards wiped, and the silicone along the tiles was intact without discoloration. The shared spaces were wiped down multiple times a day—I saw staff working through the rotation midafternoon—and the place had that faint citrus-cleaner scent without being overpowering."
