        "source_1": "I booked this place mainly to work remotely for a day, and the “free” Wi‑Fi was a hurdle. After registering, the connection capped around 1 Mbps and logged me out after about 30 minutes unless I upgraded to a paid tier. Speed tests in my room hovered at 0.8–1.2 Mbps down and under 0.3 up, which meant my 9 a.m. video call stuttered and dropped twice. Only one device was allowed per room at a time, so I couldn’t keep my laptop and phone connected together. Oddly, the signal in the lobby was stronger, but I needed to work from the desk in my room and couldn’t.",
        "source_2": "I came downstairs for breakfast at 7:15 a.m. and found the buffet looking picked over already: the scrambled eggs were runny, the bacon pale and limp, and the pastries tasted like they’d been out overnight. The fruit tray had hard pears and a couple of browned apple slices. Coffee came from a push-button machine and had a burnt aftertaste; I ended up walking over to the station cafe for an espresso. Staff did bring out refills around 7:45, but by then I’d mostly given up.",
        "source_3": "My “standard double” on the fourth floor felt very tight. With my 24-inch suitcase open on the floor, I could barely squeeze between the bed and the desk chair. The closet was shallow, so my coat brushed against the door when closed, and the bathroom had a tiny square shower where the curtain clung to me. I had to set the chair on top of the luggage rack just to create a path from the door to the window. If you’re traveling with two bags, plan on a bit of a shuffle.",
        "source_4": "The location directly opposite the train station helped with arrival, but it was a noisy spot. Platform announcements started before sunrise and carried straight through the window, and the squeal of brakes was noticeable until late. The windows in my room seemed single‑glazed, so even with earplugs I woke up a few times. Crossing the multi‑lane road with two rolling suitcases wasn’t fun either; the pedestrian light changed quickly, and the sidewalks were crowded in the evening with smokers outside the bars.",
        "source_5": "I’ve stayed twice now, most recently for a weekend with my family. Our fifth‑floor room faced the courtyard and had enough space to set up a travel crib while keeping two medium suitcases open along the wall. We walked from the platform to the lobby in under two minutes, used the post office across the road to send a small box of souvenirs home, and grabbed a quick call at the international booths for time-sensitive errands. Breakfast included a spread of fruit, cheeses, and hot items, and the staff brought warm milk for our toddler without us asking. The Wi‑Fi in our room ran around 20–25 Mbps and stayed connected to both my phone and tablet. We liked it enough to put it back on our itinerary for our return trip.",
        "source_6": "I did two nights for a business trip and ended up checking out early. My room faced the tracks, and the loudspeaker announcements broke up my sleep both nights; the air unit struggled to keep the room cool, so closing the window didn’t help much. The shower drained slowly and left a puddle around my feet, and the breakfast area was so congested I circled twice to find a table. The Wi‑Fi kept booting me from the captive portal, which made uploading a presentation painful. I moved to a place a few blocks away after the first night, absorbing the change fee just to get rest."
