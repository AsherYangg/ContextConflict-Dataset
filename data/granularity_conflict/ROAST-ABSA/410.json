        "source_1": "I took this stats course alongside my day job, planning roughly an hour every other evening. The workload felt steady: most weeks I finished the videos, practice problems, and the quiz in about 4–5 hours. I rarely had to pause the lectures, and the auto-graded quizzes typically took me 15–25 minutes. The final exam was a single sitting with a 90-minute timer, and I wrapped it up with time to spare. The suggested readings were optional, so I skipped a few without falling behind. I never felt like I had to give up a weekend; pacing it out on weekdays worked fine.",
        "source_2": "What tripped me up was the wording on the quizzes and the final. In the lessons, the instructor talked about “alpha” and “Type I error” interchangeably, but the quiz used “significance threshold” and “false positive rate” without clarifying they were the same thing. In Week 3, the lecture emphasized “sample proportion,” but the quiz asked about “MLE for a Bernoulli parameter,” which hadn’t been phrased that way before. On the final, one multiple‑choice option said “maximize the likelihood of the null” and another said “minimize the p-value,” even though the lessons never put those side by side. I understood the core ideas, but the phrasing made it hard to map questions to what I’d just learned.",
        "source_3": "I went through all six weeks, rewatched several segments, and kept a detailed notebook, yet I still couldn’t reliably connect the test items to the material. I’d study confidence intervals using the examples from the lectures, then face problems that felt like riddles with unfamiliar wording. By the time I attempted the final, I’d already spent evenings revisiting earlier modules, and I hit a wall when I saw questions framed in ways I hadn’t seen before. After that attempt, I decided to stop rather than keep pouring hours into spinning my wheels.",
        "source_4": "For me, the quizzes were right in line with the lectures. Each week’s set seemed to target the exact techniques just shown—like Week 2’s normal approximation for proportions and Week 4’s two-sample t-tests—with numbers changed but structure preserved. The practice problems before each quiz mirrored the final items extremely closely, and the solution videos pointed back to specific timestamps in the lectures. By the time I reached the final, nothing felt out of left field; the study guide listed the distributions, test setups, and formulas, and that checklist matched the exam.",
        "source_5": "I came in rusty on math and appreciated how the course laid out a roadmap at the start of every module: objectives, key formulas, and a short glossary. The terminology felt consistent across lecture slides, transcripts, and the downloadable notes. I leaned on the provided cheat sheets during quizzes, and when a term popped up, I could almost always find it verbatim in the lecture PDF. The progression—from descriptive stats to inference—felt gradual, and I never had to search outside the course to answer the graded items."
