        "source_1": "I’m commenting only on the project. The rubric said “tell a story with data,” but it wasn’t clear what counted as complete: no guidance on page length, number of figures, or whether code had to be in-line or in an appendix. The dataset had different encodings for the same category and lots of NAs, and there were no instructions on how strict the cleaning needed to be. I lost a full evening wrestling with package versions (dplyr/tidyr conflicts), and the auto-grader rejected my RMarkdown because my random seed didn’t match the template, even though the conclusions and coefficients were the same. Most of my time went to decoding expectations on the Week 4 forum thread rather than building the model.",
        "source_2": "As an overall take, the course carried me from simple OLS to diagnostics and model selection in a way that finally made the math click. The instructor walked through the normal equations and then mirrored the steps in R so the transition from theory to code felt seamless. By week 3, I could read a journal article’s regression table without skimming. I wrapped the project two days early, added residual plots and a brief model-comparison section, and still had time for peer reviews. The platform played lectures at 1.25x without hiccups, and the class forums had quick responses when I got stuck on interpreting interaction terms.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on workload and pacing: the weekly cadence stacked up quickly. Each module had about 90 minutes of video, multiple readings, and a quiz that wasn’t trivial, plus a project milestone looming on Sunday at 11:59 pm. Installing specific R packages and downloading a 1.2 GB dataset took longer than expected, and I burned an extra night troubleshooting a compilation error in RMarkdown. Peer reviews opened right after the project submission window closed, so there wasn’t any breathing room. I ended up submitting a bare-bones notebook without the optional visualization section.",
        "source_4": "My experience with the platform overshadowed a lot of the course. Twice the video player froze at 95% and wouldn’t mark the lecture complete, so the next quiz stayed locked until I rewatched the last ten minutes. On project day, the submission page threw “network error” three times, even though speed tests looked fine. The discussion search returned “something went wrong” for an entire afternoon during week 3, which made it hard to find the TA’s clarifications on heteroskedasticity tests. Support replied after five days, by which time the peer-review window had already closed for me.",
        "source_5": "Narrowly on the project’s quality: the case study felt well chosen and realistic. The prompt guided me to compare linear vs. ridge, check VIFs for multicollinearity, and justify the final model with cross-validation, which made the expectations transparent. Example notebooks clarified how to structure the analysis and conclusion, so I could focus on interpretation rather than formatting. I finished early and used the extra time to polish plots, add a short limitations section, and tighten the narrative so it read more like a conference poster than a dump of code."
