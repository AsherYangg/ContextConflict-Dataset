        "source_1": "I specifically booked a room with a connecting door because I needed it for my kids, and I was worried about noise. The neighbors watched a late movie, so I stood right by the door to check: with the latch fully engaged and the sweep snug against the floor, I could barely make out a muffled bass line. From the bed, it just blended into the AC hum. For my stay, the door between rooms felt solid and did its job.",
        "source_2": "Spent a long weekend on the ninth floor, courtyard side. Check-in took under five minutes, room was ready at noon, and the hallways were quiet each night. The bed felt supportive, blackout curtains actually blocked the streetlights, and the double-paned window kept traffic noise out. Housekeeping refreshed towels without moving my toiletries, and the lobby coffee at 6 a.m. didn’t taste burnt. I’d book here again for a short city break.",
        "source_3": "I’m picky about service, so here’s my whole interaction: at 11:30 p.m., the room next door cranked up a game show. I called the front desk, and security knocked within five minutes; the volume dropped right away. Ten minutes later, the agent called back to confirm it stayed quiet and offered to move me if it returned. In the morning, the manager asked how the night went and handed me two breakfast vouchers without me asking.",
        "source_4": "My experience was rough. The TV in the adjoining room was blasting until after 2 a.m., and the voices carried through the connecting door word for word. I phoned the desk twice; they said they couldn’t hear anything from the hallway and suggested I “give it a few minutes.” No offer to switch rooms, no follow-up, and I had a 6 a.m. flight. I left feeling like I’d spent the night at a bus station.",
        "source_5": "I’m laser-focused on sleep quality: the mattress had a medium-firm feel with a plush topper, and I could pick between firm and soft pillows from the closet. The thermostat held 68°F steady, the fan had a consistent white-noise setting, and the blackout shades overlapped with no light gaps. There was a youth soccer team on my floor, but I didn’t hear footsteps or doors slamming through the night and woke up before my alarm feeling rested.",
        "source_6": "If you care about room-to-room privacy, check your connecting door. Mine had a visible gap at the latch side where the weather strip was peeling off, and I could hear my neighbor’s phone conversation clearly even when my own TV was off. I rolled up a towel to block the gap at the bottom, which helped a little, but not enough for a midnight call that went on for nearly an hour."
