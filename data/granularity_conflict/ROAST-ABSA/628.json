        "source_1": "I rely on my phone for family photos, and the camera leaves me juggling retakes. Indoor shots under warm kitchen lights come out with smudged skin tone and soft edges, and it takes an extra beat to lock focus. Outside at noon, tapping to expose for faces blows out the sky, and shadows crush detail. Recording 1080p of a kids’ soccer drill, panning across the field introduces little jitter lines, and fast motion looks smeary. At a birthday party, the candle-lit scene picked up grain even after multiple focus taps. Quick social posts are fine, but anything I’d save or print gets bumped to another device.",
        "source_2": "My priority is multitasking, and the extra RAM is the reason I bought this. I keep Spotify, Gmail, Slack, Maps, and Chrome with roughly 20 tabs open during the workday. The memory meter shows headroom even with all that, and I can jump from a Slack link to Chrome to Maps without pages reloading. Switching back to Gmail drafts doesn’t dump content like my previous phone used to, and background audio keeps playing while I move between apps. I don’t care about games or cameras; I just need a lot of apps to stay resident, and the capacity handles that well.",
        "source_3": "I picked this up as a low-budget daily driver and ran it as my main phone for two weeks. The checkout total felt friendly, and basic stuff—calls, OTPs, WhatsApp—works as expected. Beyond that, the hardware mix feels off: on paper there’s plenty of RAM, yet scrolling through news feeds gives blur trails, and a couple of games mark higher graphics options as unsupported. The rear camera struggles in indoor lighting; faces look muddy, and there’s a small delay before the shutter fires. It covers simple messaging and banking, but for smoother motion and decent photos, it doesn’t meet what I need.",
        "source_4": "I’m particular about screen motion, so I zeroed in on the refresh behavior. In Twitter and Instagram, fast scrolls produce a faint double-image and text smears while moving. With the developer overlay on, the counter sits at 60 Hz no matter what I’m doing; animations don’t seem to ramp higher. Dropping animation scale in settings makes transitions snappier but doesn’t remove the motion blur. After half an hour of reading long articles while scrolling, my eyes feel strained in a way I don’t get on higher-rate panels.",
        "source_5": "I bought this mostly for the price. I needed a spare phone for calls, bank apps, and WhatsApp, and this came in cheaper than several models in the same range. The total fit my budget without juggling expenses, and setup took minutes. For the amount I paid, it handles the essentials I bought it for. I didn’t test cameras or games; I wanted something that wouldn’t feel like a splurge and could sit in my bag for everyday tasks.",
        "source_6": "I evaluate devices with graphics-heavy apps, and this one runs into compatibility walls. In Call of Duty Mobile, the High and Very High presets are greyed out, and toggling anti-aliasing throws a message that the device doesn’t support it. Genshin Impact boots but caps effects and drops frames when there’s foliage and particle effects on screen. A couple of UI transitions inside the games look choppy compared to an older phone I have with less RAM, which was surprising. On YouTube, 60 fps videos show occasional frame skips during fast pans and quick cuts."
