        "source_1": "I bought an iPhone 15 in early August and the screen went dark on day 18 while I was scrolling through messages on a train. No drop, no pressure—just a black display with notifications still chiming through my watch. The device had a tempered glass and a silicone case from day one. At the service center they ran diagnostics and said the display module wasn’t responding; they shipped it out for a part replacement. I’ve never had a phone go out like that so soon, and it shook my confidence because I use my phone for work calls, OTPs, and banking, and suddenly I couldn’t even unlock it. I came from a Samsung S21 that never gave me a single display issue in two years, so this was a surprise.",
        "source_2": "My feedback is strictly about the screen: it’s the reason I chose this model. I keep brightness around 40–50% indoors, and even stepping out at noon, the text in email remains easy to read without shading the phone. Watching HDR movies on Netflix shows nuanced shadows and no banding, and scrolling news sites feels unusually smooth, like the text is glued to my finger. I’m picky about uniformity, and I checked for tint and dead pixels on day one—none found. Three months of commuting with the phone bouncing around in my backpack, and the panel has stayed consistent, with no ghosting or random lines.",
        "source_3": "Out of the box, my iPhone 14 had a faint rattle near the top edge and a slight misalignment where the screen meets the frame—noticeable when you run a fingernail along the right bezel. The SIM tray also wasn’t flush; it caught on my case. At the store, the technician acknowledged a gap but said it was within tolerance. I insisted on a swap because dust under the selfie camera was visible in bright light. The replacement was better, but the experience made me question how thoroughly these units are inspected before shipping. I’ve never had to check for adhesive bubbles and dust spots on a new phone until this one.",
        "source_4": "I switched from a Galaxy A-series and wanted an all-around device for photos, maps, and WhatsApp calls. Day-to-day, it feels quick: launching the camera is instant, face unlock works even with my glasses, and GPS stays locked during a 40-minute drive. Battery gets me from 7 a.m. to late evening without grabbing the charger at work. There was a single hiccup in month two where the screen froze for about 10 seconds while opening Instagram, then recovered on its own; hasn’t happened again. After six months, I don’t feel like I’m babysitting the phone—just using it.",
        "source_5": "Focusing solely on battery: with mixed use—two hours of YouTube, an hour of hotspot for my laptop, and endless Telegram—the phone gives me about 6.5–7 hours of screen-on time. I top up with a 20W USB-C charger at lunch, and it jumps from 30% to 70% in roughly 35 minutes. On a weekend trip, I used Maps for 3 hours with Bluetooth audio and ended the day at 22%. Battery health shows 96% after nine months and 211 cycles, and I haven’t noticed sudden dips or weird percentage jumps near the end.",
        "source_6": "I work around drywall and tile, so my phone lives in dusty pockets. Twice I’ve knocked it off a low shelf onto tile—maybe waist height—with a thin case on, and the display didn’t crack or show lines. The frame picked up tiny scuffs, but the screen stayed intact and touch remained responsive. I wipe it down with a slightly damp microfiber cloth after site visits, and there’s been no moisture ingress or flaky behavior from the display. Whatever glass they’re using seems to handle day-to-day knocks better than my last midrange Android, which spidered from a similar fall."
