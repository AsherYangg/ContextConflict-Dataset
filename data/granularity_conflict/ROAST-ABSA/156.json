        "source_1": "I mainly care about charging, so I timed it for a week. Using the stock 33W brick, it goes from around 12% to full in roughly 75–90 minutes. The last 10% slows a bit, but that’s standard trickle behavior. I did three runs: 12%→100% in 78 minutes (screen off), 20%→100% in 70 minutes (airplane mode), and 9%→100% in 86 minutes (while checking WhatsApp). The phone gets mildly warm near the top, nothing alarming, and I haven’t seen a single session cross the 2‑hour mark.",
        "source_2": "After updating to MIUI 14.0.3, my front camera shows an “AI” toggle next to HDR. With it on, the phone does a decent job separating the subject in portrait selfies outdoors; hair strands can still blur, but the bokeh looks more natural than before the update. Indoors under tube lights, skin smoothing can go overboard and details look waxy, yet the feature is clearly present and switchable. For reference, this is on the 13MP front shooter, app version 5.0.12.",
        "source_3": "As an overall package, it’s been a steady daily driver for me over the past month. Calls are clear on Jio, GPS locks fast for Uber, and the fingerprint reader wakes the screen almost instantly. My unit charges from 15% to full in about an hour and twenty on average, and the spec sheet on mi.com (UFS 2.2, 90Hz display, IR blaster) matches what I received. Cameras are serviceable for daylight shots of documents and food; low light needs a steady hand. At the price I paid (₹14,999 during sale), I don’t feel shortchanged.",
        "source_4": "I visited the MI service centre in Koramangala to ask about “AI portrait” on the front camera. The technician pulled up the model’s user guide and explained that the marketing material refers to AI scene detection on the rear camera by default. He updated my camera app, showed me where the AI toggle lives, and offered to swap my charging cable that had a loose connector. They didn’t brush me off; I was in and out in about 25 minutes with a printed job sheet.",
        "source_5": "I’m picky about cameras, and this one struggles in my apartment’s warm lighting. The rear photos show crunchy edges from sharpening, and darker areas pick up speckled noise. The front camera softens faces too much even with beauty sliders off, and it hunts for focus when my kid moves around; several birthday shots ended up smeared. Night mode brightens the scene but sacrifices fine texture on hair and fabric. I tried a third‑party camera app, but the results weren’t markedly different.",
        "source_6": "My gripe is with specs not lining up with what the retailer page advertised the week I ordered. The listing banner showed “AI selfie portrait” and NFC; my phone doesn’t have NFC, and there’s no AI selfie option on my unit (camera app 5.0.10, MIUI 14.0.2). The Mi Remote app also reports “No IR hardware detected,” even though the page mentioned an IR blaster at the time. Support acknowledged the listing was revised later and offered a small coupon, but I’m left with features I expected and don’t actually have."
