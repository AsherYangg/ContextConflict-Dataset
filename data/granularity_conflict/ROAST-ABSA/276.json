        "source_1": "I bought this phone mainly for work calls, and everyone on the other end keeps telling me my voice fades or sounds like I’m speaking through a pillow. It’s worst when I’m in a quiet room with a ceiling fan on; the volume meter in the voice recorder app visibly dips when I talk at a normal pace, then shoots up randomly, like the noise cancellation is fighting my speech. WhatsApp and regular carrier calls behave the same, and recordings replay with a faint hiss. Swapping SIMs and even toggling VoLTE didn’t change it, but plugging in a wired headset makes the issue disappear, which points straight at the built-in mic.",
        "source_2": "I don’t play games, but the phone still struggles when I juggle daily apps. A typical morning is Gmail, a banking app, Chrome with three or four tabs, and Maps in the background; switching between them often freezes for a few seconds, and the keyboard sometimes appears half a beat late. Opening the camera from the lock screen can take three to four seconds, which has cost me a few candid shots. I’ve installed the latest updates, cleared cache, and even disabled animations, yet it still stalls and occasionally throws “app not responding” prompts until I force close.",
        "source_3": "I use the device mostly for calls, texts, WhatsApp, and YouTube Music, and it handles those without fuss. Setup was straightforward, and I moved over from a much older handset, so this felt smoother in day-to-day swipes and app launches. Friends say I come through clearly on regular and VoIP calls, and I can switch between chatting and checking a link in Chrome without hiccups. I grabbed it during a holiday discount, and for that price, it fits what I need as a light user who isn’t into gaming.",
        "source_4": "I focus heavily on audio because I record voice notes and quick podcast snippets on the go, and the mic has been reliable for me. In a quiet office, my recordings are clean, and in a café with espresso machines humming, the voice stays front and center with less background hiss than my older phone. Colleagues on Zoom say they can hear me distinctly, and even car Bluetooth handoffs don’t introduce weird compression. I tested against a friend’s phone by reading the same paragraph into both, and this one captured consonants and breathing more naturally.",
        "source_5": "After three weeks, the phone doesn’t live up to the launch claims I saw about smooth multitasking. Jumping from a banking app to Messages to fetch an OTP sometimes locks for a moment and then dumps me back at the home screen, and it happens often enough to be annoying. On calls, coworkers ask me to repeat sentences because the audio dips or crackles like the mic gain is unstable. I’ve reset network settings, ran it in safe mode, and even tried a factory reset; it’s usable for basic tasks, but for the amount I paid, I expected a lot more consistency.",
        "source_6": "What frustrates me isn’t just the hiccups, but how the brand handled them. The product page emphasized “lag-free” app switching and clear calling, yet my support ticket got a copy-paste response pointing at my carrier and suggesting a future update without a timeline. I visited a service center where they ran a 30-second diagnostic, said the hardware passed, and sent me home without addressing the call clarity complaints I documented with recordings. Two incremental updates later, the same call artifacts remain, leaving me with a device that doesn’t match the pitch that convinced me to buy it."
