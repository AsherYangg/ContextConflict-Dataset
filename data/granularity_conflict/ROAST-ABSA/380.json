        "source_1": "I picked up the OnePlus last month as my main phone and it’s handled my routine without hiccups. OxygenOS feels quick moving between Slack, Maps, and the camera, and the 4K clips I shot at my kid’s recital came out sharp with steady focus and clean audio. Photos in daylight keep skin tones natural, and the ultrawide doesn’t smear the corners as much as my older phone did. Battery gets me from 7 a.m. to late evening with Bluetooth music and two hours of YouTube, and a 25-minute top-up takes it from around 20% to the 90s. For what I paid under festival pricing, it undercut comparable Samsung and Pixel models I considered.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the camera: 4K at 60 fps looks fine in bright sun, but as soon as I pan across a street, exposure pumps and the sky blows out. Indoors, the main sensor pulls in a lot of grain and skin gets waxy, and the stabilization jitters when I walk. After about 8 minutes of continuous 4K recording, the phone warms near the camera bump and drops frames before throwing a temperature warning. The built‑in mic picks up wind rumble unless I cup it with my hand, which isn’t ideal for quick vlog clips.",
        "source_3": "My take is purely on price and value. I bought the 8/128 variant at ₹39,999 during the first sale, and two weeks later it dropped by ₹3,000 with bank offers stacked on top. Support said there’s no price protection, and the trade‑in value for my perfectly fine Nord 2 was far below what Cashify quoted. With only 128 GB and no microSD, I had to pay extra for cloud storage to keep 4K footage, so the overall spend went higher than planned. If I had waited, the total outlay would have been quite a bit lower.",
        "source_4": "As an overall daily driver, it’s a mixed bag for me after two months. Scrolling is smooth and app launches are quick, but reception in my office basement is consistently one bar while my colleague’s iPhone holds a call; mine drops or the other side hears me cut out. The earpiece sounds thin in noisy cafes, and the bottom speaker gets covered by my palm in landscape, making movies hard to hear. The 11.0.9 update introduced a quirk where the gesture bar disappears until I reboot, which has happened three times in a week. Battery sits at about 5 hours of screen‑on time with mostly 4G and some 5G, which leaves me searching for a charger before the commute home.",
        "source_5": "I’m only commenting on the company’s support. My bundled USB‑C cable stopped working after a month, so I reached out through the OnePlus chat. The agent verified the serial, arranged a pickup the same afternoon, and a replacement arrived three days later with tracking updates at each step. No invoice printouts were needed; a soft copy was enough. They followed up by email a week later to confirm the issue was resolved, which I appreciated."
