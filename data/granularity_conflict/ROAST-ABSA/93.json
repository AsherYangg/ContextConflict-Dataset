        "source_1": "I drink my K‑Cup coffee black on the 8 oz setting with a Keurig K‑Classic, and this pod leans distinctly sweet even without sugar. There’s a caramel-like note that lingers into the aftertaste, almost syrupy around the edges. At 6 oz the sweetness concentrates and starts to taste candy-like; at 10 oz it thins out but that sugary finish still sticks around. If you’re chasing a bone-dry cup, this heads in a different direction.",
        "source_2": "After a month of weekday mornings with a 40‑count box, I ended up reaching for other pods more often. On my K‑Slim at 8 oz, the body looks a shade too clear and the mouthfeel lands closer to tea than the thick “extra bold” I was expecting. To get more heft I had to switch to 6 oz or double up pods. The flavor tilts a touch sweet, which made it feel less robust next to my usual Dark Magic or Italian Roast cups.",
        "source_3": "We ran through two sampler packs this spring and this is the one that stuck. On a K‑Elite, the 8 oz brew pours with a heavy body and a faint maple edge that reminds me of the ceramic‑mug coffee at the roadside diner near my office. It hits that medium‑roast sweet spot without char, and it stays smooth even if I add a splash of half‑and‑half. We keep a sleeve at home and another in my desk so I don’t run out; it’s the best of the bunch we tried.",
        "source_4": "I was specifically hunting for a diner‑style cup—plain, steady, and built for a bagel dunk—and this nails it. Brewed at 10 oz on my K‑Select, it doesn’t shout with smoky bitterness and doesn’t need syrups to feel complete. A teaspoon of cream rounds it out, but it holds up just fine black. If your benchmark is a Dunkin counter pour, this lands right in that lane.",
        "source_5": "The box says medium, but in my kitchen it drinks darker. On a K‑Mini with the 8 oz fill, there’s a roasty edge that creeps toward smoky and a lingering bite that I usually associate with dark roasts. I even tried using filtered water and a 10 oz pour to soften it, which reduced the intensity but also washed out the flavor. For someone who sticks to mild medium pods in the afternoon, this comes off a notch heavier than expected."
