        "source_1": "I stayed two nights over the weekend and was impressed from the start: check-in took maybe three minutes, the lobby smelled freshly cleaned, and my king room had crisp linens and a bathroom that looked like it had just been scrubbed. The free breakfast was more than an afterthought—scrambled eggs, a waffle station, fresh fruit, and yogurt—so I didn’t need to hunt down a café. The front desk team greeted me by name after the first day and pointed me toward a quiet floor when I asked. Considering I paid under a hundred dollars a night, it felt like I was getting a lot without add-on fees.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on cleanliness because that matters most to me. The room was neatly arranged, but the air vent above the bed had a visible line of dust, and there were a couple of long strands of hair stuck to the tile near the shower drain. The desk surface felt tacky along the edge, like it hadn’t been wiped properly, and the carpet had a small dark patch near the window. I asked housekeeping to swing back for another pass, and while they changed the towels promptly, the vent and the carpet spot stayed as they were. I ended up using my own disinfectant wipes before settling in.",
        "source_3": "My focus is the breakfast setup. It’s advertised as free, which is true, but the selection was hit-or-miss depending on the time. On my first morning at 7:15, there were eggs, oatmeal, and a waffle iron with batter; by 8:40 the next day, the eggs tray was empty, the fruit bowl had three oranges left, and the coffee was so weak I added hot cocoa mix to make it drinkable. The staff did bring out more pastries, but they were all prepackaged. If you show up early, you’ll find options; arrive closer to nine, and it’s mostly toast and cereal.",
        "source_4": "I interacted mainly with the staff and came away impressed with how hands-on they were. Kim at the front desk noticed my room key had demagnetized and had a replacement ready before I reached the counter. Later that evening, a housekeeper named Luis came up to troubleshoot a TV remote that wasn’t pairing and stayed until it worked. In the morning, the breakfast attendant saw me scanning for something gluten-free and brought out sealed yogurt and fruit from the back without me even asking. They made the place feel easy to navigate.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the rate looked great on paper, but the stay had several rough edges. The walls felt thin; I could hear hallway chatter and door latches clacking before 6 a.m. The window AC cycled with a rattling sound that made it hard to doze off, and the elevator paused on random floors even when no one was waiting. Housekeeping knocked around 8:20 despite the tag on my handle, which threw off my morning. Breakfast was crowded, with a line curling into the lobby—fine if you’re not in a rush, but I was. By checkout, I was more tired than when I arrived.",
        "source_6": "I’m commenting only on price and value. I booked same-day through the hotel’s site with an AAA rate and paid $82 before taxes; after taxes, it came to $93. Parking and Wi‑Fi were included, and the front desk granted a 1 p.m. checkout at no extra charge. Nearby properties on the same street were quoting $130–$150 with a separate parking fee, so this felt like a rare find for a quick overnight. If you’re cost-conscious and don’t need boutique flourishes, this rate stretches the budget nicely."
