        "source_1": "I unboxed the phone last week and my unit came with a charger brick, USB‑C cable, SIM ejector, a thin clear case, and the paperwork. Setup took about 10 minutes including transferring WhatsApp and Google accounts. The phone feels slim and the patterned back catches light nicely on a desk. I shot a birthday party indoors where faces looked a bit soft, but balcony photos at sunset came out clean enough to share. For what I paid, it handles daily calls, browsing, and a few rounds of BGMI without fuss.",
        "source_2": "I bought this specifically for product photos of my handmade jewelry, so I’m only talking about the camera. In the high‑resolution mode, tiny bead textures and stitching on the display cloth stay crisp, and HDR keeps the window highlights in check. Portrait mode separates earrings from the felt background with neat edges, and colors match what’s on my workbench without heavy editing. Handheld 1080p clips of unboxing steps look stable enough for reels, and focusing on close‑ups snaps into place quickly.",
        "source_3": "My focus is the camera because I record cooking vlogs at home. Under warm kitchen lights, white balance drifts and skin looks plasticky, and the phone hunts for focus when I move a utensil toward the lens. There’s a slight delay after tapping the shutter, so steam shots miss the peak moment. Walking and talking along the hallway, the video shows side‑to‑side wobble, and the audio has a faint hiss. Even scanning QR codes at the grocery store takes two or three tries unless I stand perfectly still.",
        "source_4": "I’m only judging the design, since that mattered most to me. I chose the emerald color and the matte back shrugs off fingerprints even after a commute, while the curved edges rest comfortably in my palm. The buttons have a precise click, and the weight feels balanced for one‑handed typing on the train. A couple of friends asked if it was a much pricier model because the camera island and subtle stripes look sharp in person.",
        "source_5": "This is just about the box contents: my package had the phone, a short USB‑C cable, and the SIM tool—no charger brick, no earphones, and no pre‑applied screen protector. The quick‑start leaflet mentions a protective case, but I didn’t get one. I chatted with support and they said contents vary by region, which wasn’t stated clearly on the product page. I had to buy a separate charger and case the same day.",
        "source_6": "I’ll give an overall take after two weeks of daily use. The design turns heads and it sits light in a jeans pocket, and routine stuff like banking apps and Maps run without hiccups. Daylight photos from a walk in the park were fine, but shots in my dim living room looked smeared enough that I stopped using the camera at night. I paid the equivalent of $179 locally, and at that price nearby stores offered rival models bundled with earphones and a faster charger, so it didn’t feel like much of a deal."
