        "source_1": "I booked this place purely for the access to transit, and it delivered on that front. The Line 2 metro entrance was a 3–4 minute walk from the lobby doors, and we were able to reach the museum district in about 10 minutes without a transfer. We walked to the riverfront in roughly 12 minutes with a stroller, and the stadium for the rugby match took two quick metro stops. For anyone planning to hop between attractions on a tight schedule, the location shaved real time off our days.",
        "source_2": "My take is strictly about cleanliness. When we arrived, the bathroom sink had toothpaste flecks on the faucet and a long hair on the vanity, and the shower grout looked dark along the lower tiles. The bedside table felt a bit tacky to the touch, and there was a faint dust line along the headboard. Housekeeping did refresh things the next morning after I asked at the desk, but the first impression in the room wasn’t what I expected.",
        "source_3": "We came as a family for a rugby weekend and the overall stay went smoothly. Check-in at around 9:30 pm took about five minutes, the staff managed to put our two rooms on the same floor, and the layout was simple to navigate even with kids. The rooms weren’t huge, but the storage cubbies fit our gear, water pressure was steady, and the Wi‑Fi held up for streaming highlights. The metro stop around the corner made getting to the stadium and back easy. We did try Aarapana Indian Restaurant nearby on the first night and didn’t finish our meals, so the next evening we stuck to a small bakery two blocks away. For our purposes—sleep, showers, and quick transit—it did the job.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on efficiency: arriving at 2:15 pm, I stood in line behind three parties while a single front desk agent checked everyone in. The printer jammed while they processed a keycard, which added another ten minutes, and the lift was out of service for part of the afternoon so we waited through two cycles to get upstairs. Towels weren’t replaced until close to 5 pm even after a request at noon. Nothing catastrophic, but each little delay stacked up when we were trying to head out to a dinner reservation.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression, the convenience to sights didn’t outweigh the comfort issues for me. Our room faced a busy boulevard, and with single-pane windows we could hear scooters and sirens well past midnight. The air-conditioning unit rattled intermittently, and the mattress dipped toward the middle so my partner and I kept rolling together. Breakfast felt cramped with a queue spilling into the lobby. We skipped eating nearby after one rough meal at Aarapana Indian Restaurant and ended up walking 15 minutes for better options. If I had another rugby trip, I’d aim for somewhere quieter, even if it meant a longer metro ride.",
        "source_6": "I’m zeroing in on dining around the hotel. Listings made it sound like a food hub, but many places within a two-block radius felt touristy. We tried Aarapana Indian Restaurant because it stayed open late, and the curries were flat and overly oily, with naan that arrived lukewarm. The next night we had to head closer to the market district—about a 15-minute walk—to find a bistro that matched the kind of quality we expected. For travelers who pick a base mainly to be surrounded by solid restaurants, the immediate streets didn’t live up to the promise."
