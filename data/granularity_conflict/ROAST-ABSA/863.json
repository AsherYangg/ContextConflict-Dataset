        "source_1": "I picked this place because I wanted to be within walking distance of the French Quarter, and the location delivered. From the front door to Jackson Square took me about 12 minutes on foot, and the St. Charles streetcar stop was two blocks away. I grabbed beignets at Café du Monde in the early morning and walked back along well‑lit streets without feeling isolated. Even late at night there were cabs and rideshares cruising the main avenue, so getting back after a show at Preservation Hall was straightforward.",
        "source_2": "I booked the room the same day and was drawn in by a $129 headline rate, but the bill told a different story. City taxes and a nightly “destination” fee bumped it up, and the on‑site parking added another $35, so my one night went from $129 to just over $210 at checkout. They also placed a $50 hold that didn’t drop off my card for four days. For anyone budgeting tightly, those add‑ons change the math quite a bit.",
        "source_3": "My partner and I did a quick weekend in NOLA and stayed here on a whim, and it worked out smoothly from arrival to checkout. The lobby has a quirky, art‑house feel with bold colors and local photos, and our room felt freshly kept with a firm mattress and blackout curtains that actually blocked the morning sun. We rolled into the garage around 9 p.m., used a keycard at the gate, and found a spot right by the elevator, then walked to dinner on Magazine Street. Quiet night, hot shower with steady pressure, and a hassle‑free checkout—wouldn’t hesitate to book it again for another short trip.",
        "source_4": "I’m only commenting on the parking, since that’s all I used while my spouse attended a conference nearby. The garage entrance is tight, clearance showed 6'6\", and my mid‑size SUV barely made it under the pipe. Spaces are narrow and the turning radius on the second level is sharp; I had to back up twice to avoid scraping a pillar. A guard sat in a booth, but the roll‑up gate was propped open for a stretch in the afternoon, and by evening the lot was full, sending late arrivals to meter parking on the street.",
        "source_5": "As an overall stay, it felt more like a series of small hassles than a quick escape. Check‑in took nearly 25 minutes because only one front desk terminal was open, and our room wasn’t ready at 3:30 despite the stated time. The AC unit cycled loudly through the night, and we could hear hallway conversation and elevator dings clearly from the bed. The location made getting to the Quarter easy enough, but between the slow elevators, thin walls, and surprise fees at checkout, I left more worn out than when I arrived."
