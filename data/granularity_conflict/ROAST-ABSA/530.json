        "source_1": "I came into the CSS3 course right after the HTML5 track, and the pace caught me off guard. In week two, the lectures moved from basic selectors to combinators and specificity in a single stretch, and then straight into flexbox before I’d really digested the cascade. I found myself rewinding a lot, pausing to check MDN, and slipping past the suggested weekly checkpoints. When grid was introduced, it was stacked immediately after flexbox with minimal breathing room, so I had to extend my timeline to keep up.",
        "source_2": "I took the course over three weeks, following the syllabus from box model fundamentals to layout techniques and simple animations. The quizzes nudged me to revisit tricky details like stacking contexts and how z-index interacts with positioned elements. The capstone had me build a responsive landing page with media queries, and the instructor’s “nesting boxes” analogy finally made the cascade feel intuitive. Starting from bare HTML, I finished with a portfolio that renders cleanly on my phone and desktop.",
        "source_3": "The assignments were a mixed bag for me. The quizzes leaned hard on wording—think “choose the exact definition of inline-block”—while offering little on practical debugging with dev tools. In the project, the autograder was rigid about class names and whitespace; I lost hours because I used tabs instead of spaces and labeled a component “card” instead of the expected “panel.” My layout matched the spec, but the checker focused on conventions more than the CSS behavior, so most of my effort went into satisfying the rubric rather than improving the design.",
        "source_4": "I focused on the instructor’s delivery and really appreciated the way he codes live and narrates his thought process. When a grid template didn’t align or a specificity conflict popped up, he showed the mistake and the fix on the spot. Each module starts with a short roadmap and ends with a recap, and he sprinkles in practical examples like building a simple hero banner. The segment on accessibility—contrast ratios, focus outlines, and skip links—was especially helpful for integrating good habits early.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, I worked through the course in about a month at roughly an hour per evening. The progression from selectors to responsive breakpoints is orderly, but the final project stays within flexbox and transitions and only gives grid a brief cameo. If you’re aiming for multi-column editorial layouts or want to dive into custom properties and theming, you’ll need to supplement with extra materials. Still, the weekly rhythm, check-ins, and consistent structure made it easy to stick with and finish.",
        "source_6": "I zeroed in on the projects and found them practical. In week three, I styled a blog page from barebones HTML, added breakpoints at 600px and 900px, and used Chrome dev tools to simulate different devices. The rubric rewarded semantic class names and responsive behavior, and the inline feedback pinpointed the one media query where I’d forgotten to adjust the font size. The final challenge asked for a card grid that collapses to a single column on small screens, and I ended up reusing that pattern in my personal site."
