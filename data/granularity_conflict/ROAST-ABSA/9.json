        "source_1": "I have a lean standard poodle who hovered around 49 lbs no matter how much kibble I fed. I started mixing half a can into his dry food with a splash of warm water twice a day, and over five weeks he nudged up to 54 lbs per the vet’s scale. He finishes meals without coaxing, and the texture blends well with his kibble. I order two cases at a time; the last two shipments arrived within two days with intact trays and clean lids.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on shipping and packaging: my last three orders showed up with dented cans, one with a bulging lid and another actually leaking along the seam. The outer box was thin, the cans rattled around with minimal padding, and the tray wrap was torn. UPS delivered a day late and left the box on its side, and I had to toss two cans and chase a replacement through customer service.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the food itself: I bought this to help my senior greyhound fill out, feeding one can a day split between breakfast and dinner for about three weeks. He ate enthusiastically the first few days, then started leaving a third of the portion in the bowl. The scale at our vet showed he was down nearly a pound, and his stool stayed soft enough that I had to mix in rice. I switched back to his old routine when he kept turning away from the evening serving.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about shipment quality: the Subscribe & Save deliveries hit the same Tuesday each month, always double-boxed with cardboard dividers and air pillows. The cans arrive upright, shrink-wrapped in tidy trays, and I haven’t seen a single dent or popped lid in six months of orders. Even during the holiday rush, the boxes came a day earlier than the tracking estimate.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two months: the food mixes easily with dry and both of my labs clean their bowls, but within a week one of them started with gas and occasional loose stools, and the other vomited twice right after breakfast. Our vet suggested it might be too rich for them, so we tapered down and the issues faded. For what it’s worth, the last shipment showed up fast and the packaging was spotless; we just couldn’t keep it in their rotation."
