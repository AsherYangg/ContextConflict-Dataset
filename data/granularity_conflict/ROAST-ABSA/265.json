        "source_1": "I keep two of these bars in my hiking pack and one in the tail bag of my motorcycle; last weekend it sat in 90-degree heat and didn’t ooze or get greasy, and in early spring at around 30 degrees it was still soft enough to bite. When I spend a day at the county fair, I toss one in my purse so I’m not stuck with corn dogs and funnel cake. The ingredient list reads cleanly, and the citrus flavor is the one I reach for most, with lemon close behind.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about labels, so this is just about ingredients: the list is short and recognizable—oats, nuts, fruit, honey, salt. No dyes, no tongue-twister chemicals, and no preservatives listed. It tastes like honey and citrus rather than something cooked up in a lab, which is exactly what I want from a bar.",
        "source_3": "Temperature durability has been a problem for me. On a dawn snowshoe at 14°F, the bar turned into a brick and I had to warm it inside my jacket before I could bite it. In July, the one in my glove box slumped and glued itself to the wrapper, leaving sticky fingers and a mess on my seat. For my uses, it doesn’t handle big temperature swings.",
        "source_4": "After finishing a variety pack, my overall take isn’t great: the texture runs powdery and crumbly, the flavor feels muted with a faint vitamin-like aftertaste, and I need a few sips of water to get it down. One bar doesn’t keep me steady for long on a 6–8 mile hike, and I’m usually rummaging for a second snack within an hour. At nearly $2 per bar where I live, I expected more substance.",
        "source_5": "Portability in a purse hasn’t worked out. I slide bars into a side pocket for trade shows, and this one keeps getting squashed into a bent rectangle; the inner seam tears jaggedly, so I’ve had crumbs spill into my bag twice. The wrapper doesn’t open cleanly, and without a napkin my hands end up sticky right before shaking hands at a booth.",
        "source_6": "Flavor-only perspective: the citrus variety has a bright zest that comes through immediately, with a gentle sweetness that pairs well with black coffee. No weird dye aftertaste, and it doesn’t leave a film in my mouth. I pack this flavor for early flights because I can eat it straight, no yogurt or fruit needed."
