        "source_1": "When I cracked open the can, the kitchen filled up with that bergamot-citrus note right away. The lid has a snug fit, so the aroma stays trapped until you pop it, and every time I do, there’s a fresh wave of fragrant steam as soon as the kettle hits 205°F. I’ve started keeping the tin by the stove because the scent alone makes the morning feel calmer; even the empty strainer smells like orange peel after a 3-minute steep. I’m commenting purely from the nose: this one perfumes the room without needing to overleaf.",
        "source_2": "I bought this because it’s marked organic, and that matters to me for something that sits in boiling water for several minutes. The tin has the USDA Organic logo and a printed lot number, and the ingredient list is short and clean. I usually brew 2 teaspoons in an infuser at a full rolling boil for about 4 minutes, and I don’t worry about residue or odd aftertastes; that peace of mind is why I chose this brand. I rotate a few teas, and this is the one I reach for when I want to stick with organic across the board.",
        "source_3": "The loose-leaf format is a bit of a process for my weekday routine. I use a mesh tea ball at my desk, and some smaller leaf bits slip through, leaving a light dust at the bottom of the mug. Cleanup is fiddly—wet leaves cling to the hinge and I have to rinse twice to get everything out. At home it’s fine with a larger basket, but in the office I miss the simplicity of bags; traveling with a strainer and a scoop from the can is awkward, and the wide opening on the tin makes it easy to spill a few leaves while measuring.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday cup, it’s been solid. I do 8 ounces of water just off a boil, about 1.5 teaspoons of leaf, and 3.5 minutes in a stainless basket. The tin seals well, and the leaves have stayed lively over a month with no stale edge. The citrus note is present without needing milk, and the base is steady enough for a second steep if I shorten it. I like that the label is straightforward and the can fits neatly in my cabinet; between the aroma and the way it brews clean, it’s become my morning default.",
        "source_5": "I’m sensitive to bergamot strength, and this one runs mild for me. At 1 teaspoon per 8 ounces, the cup leans more toward a straightforward black tea with just a whisper of citrus. I pushed to 2 teaspoons and a 5-minute steep, and the base got heavier, but the oil still felt restrained compared to other tins I’ve tried. It’s not unpleasant—just a subdued profile where I wanted a brighter, more assertive hit of orange-peel zest.",
        "source_6": "Following the tin’s loose guidance (near-boiling, 4 minutes) gave me a cup with a sharp edge that needed a splash of milk to smooth out. The aroma out of the can is inviting, but the brew itself turns a bit bracing if I’m not careful; dialing back to 3 minutes helps, though then it feels thinner. I like the sturdiness of the packaging and the clean ingredient panel, yet I find myself adjusting ratios more than usual to land on a comfortable cup, and I’m not sure it will be my permanent pantry staple."
