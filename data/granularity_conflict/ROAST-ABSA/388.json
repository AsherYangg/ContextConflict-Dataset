        "source_1": "I’ve been using this as my daily driver for two weeks, and it handles the usual routine—messaging, maps, banking, and a lot of streaming—without fuss. The screen looks crisp for YouTube and football highlights, and I can read articles in bed without straining. The speaker is loud enough for podcasts while I cook, and calls come through clearly at home. Apps open quickly and I don’t wait around between tasks. For what I paid, it feels like I’m getting a capable midrange package.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the camera: in daylight the shots are fine for social posts, but indoors I keep running into focus hunting and soft edges. At my kid’s birthday party, the shutter seemed to hesitate just a touch, so candle-blowing pictures ended up smeared unless everyone froze. Night mode brightens the scene, but skin tones skew yellow and there’s visible noise in the corners. Video stabilization struggles when I’m walking—straight lines wobble, and pans produce a slight judder.",
        "source_3": "I bought this mainly for the display, and outside at noon I have to squint; even at max brightness, the map screen looks a bit dim. Auto-brightness also reacts slowly when I step from a café into sunlight, taking a couple of seconds to catch up. Colors are punchy out of the box, but whites lean slightly warm and there’s a noticeable shift when I tilt the phone off-axis. Scrolling small text at low brightness shows a faint flicker that tires my eyes on late-night reading sessions.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on sound: the bottom speaker is fine at low volume, but once I push past about 70%, high notes get sharp and cymbals turn splashy. Listening to jazz on YouTube Music, the double bass lacks weight and the whole mix feels a bit thin. On a crowded bus, the earpiece makes voices harder to pick out from the background noise; I found myself cupping the top to hear better. Plugging into my car via Bluetooth, podcasts sound okay, but navigation prompts come in noticeably quieter than the music stream.",
        "source_5": "I care most about performance, and this one keeps up with my workload. Slack, Gmail, and Chrome with 20 tabs stay in memory, and switching between them is near-instant. Call of Duty Mobile runs smoothly on balanced settings for 30–40 minutes without the frame rate dipping in team fights. The phone warms near the camera module, but it doesn’t throttle in my use, and launching the camera from the lock screen is basically immediate.",
        "source_6": "After a month, I don’t feel the asking price lines up with what I got. The base storage filled up after a week of photos and a few large apps, forcing me to shuffle files constantly, and there was no charger in the box so I had to buy one separately. In dim restaurants, pictures look mushy unless I prop the phone on something, and the screen isn’t bright enough to check a route under direct sun without shade. Browsing in-store, I’ve seen similarly priced models with brighter panels and steadier low-light photos, which makes this one a tougher sell."
