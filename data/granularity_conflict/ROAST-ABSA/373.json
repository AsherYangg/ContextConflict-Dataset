        "source_1": "I track prices pretty closely, and Amazon came out ahead for me this month. With Subscribe & Save at 15% plus a $4 coupon, I paid $13.94 for the 24‑count box, which works out to about 58 cents per bag. My local Costco had the 20‑count for $14.99 (around 75 cents per bag). If you don’t stack the discounts, I’ve seen the Amazon price jump into the low 20s, so I set alerts and only order when it dips.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on taste alone: the batch I received leans sugary on the palate. I was hoping for a bright, tart fruit bite, but the flavor comes across more like fruit concentrate than fresh fruit. The pieces are soft yet a bit sticky, and after a few, there’s a coating on my teeth that has me reaching for water. If you like a sharper tang, this might not scratch that itch.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, these have become a lunchbox staple for my two kids. The 0.8 oz-ish pouch feels right for recess—small enough not to spoil dinner but enough to hold them over during soccer practice. The ingredient panel is short and easy to read, and the fruit taste has a nice zing without reading like candy. The cost isn’t the lowest snack in our pantry, but the convenience of auto‑deliveries keeps me from last‑minute grocery runs.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on size: the pouches are tiny. Mine weighed 0.7 oz each, and it’s basically two or three bites. My 10‑year‑old ends up asking for a second bag, so we go through a box fast. For hiking or longer outings I’d prefer 1–1.2 oz packs so I don’t have to carry multiples. Also, a few bags had a clump of little crumbs at the bottom instead of full pieces.",
        "source_5": "Ingredient purist here. The label lists fruit purée and juice, and that’s about it—no corn syrup, no artificial dyes, no preservatives. My kid with dye sensitivities has had zero issues. The texture is soft rather than rubbery, it doesn’t weld to braces, and the flavor sits close to the fruit with a bit of tartness instead of tasting like a candy aisle product.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on price at Amazon: I paid $22.24 for the 24‑pack last week, then spotted a 20‑pack at Costco for $12.99 the next day. Even after adjusting for count, the warehouse price comes out lower per bag. I canceled my auto‑ship and will only grab these on Amazon during coupon drops; otherwise I’ll stick to warehouse runs."
