        "source_1": "I’ve been using this iPhone as my daily driver for about seven months, and as an overall package it’s been dependable for me. I make two 30–40 minute calls every weekday during my commute and haven’t had a single mid-call disconnect, even switching between my home Wi‑Fi and LTE. Gestures feel snappy—pinch to zoom in Maps and the swipe keyboard keep up with fast thumbs—and the screen stays readable under midday sun when I’m taking photos at my kid’s soccer games. I bought it on a carrier installment plan at about $28/month after a small trade‑in, which felt straightforward, and the phone hasn’t given me any drama beyond the usual iOS updates.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the display: I shoot and edit photos on the phone, and the screen’s color rendering has been consistent for my workflow. With True Tone off and brightness at about 80%, skin tones in Lightroom look close to what I see on my calibrated monitor, and HDR videos pop without crushing blacks. I can read news in direct sunlight at noon without squinting, and the auto-brightness reacts quickly when I walk indoors, without the annoying “see-saw” dimming I’ve had on other devices.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about call reliability: calls keep dropping for me after roughly 5–7 minutes. I’m on dual SIM (AT&T physical + T‑Mobile eSIM) in Austin, and it happens on either line. I tried resetting network settings, disabling Wi‑Fi calling, and even swapping the SIM into an older handset—on the older phone, the same number holds a 20‑minute call just fine in the exact same spot. Apple support had me capture diagnostics, and the logs mentioned a handoff issue when moving between cells on the highway. It’s repeatable on my daily route, which makes work calls a headache.",
        "source_4": "Narrowing in on touch behavior: in games like CoD Mobile and Brawl Stars, rapid taps near the screen edges don’t always register, and I see occasional “ghost” swipes where the character keeps moving after I lift my thumb. Typing fast in Messages, the space bar misses every few words unless I slow down. I removed the glass protector, cleaned the screen, and toggled Touch Accommodations and Haptic Touch sensitivity—no real change. The same games on my older device track every tap reliably, so it’s not just my technique.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression after two weeks, I ended up exchanging it because day-to-day stuff felt off. Indoors, the screen often looks dimmer than expected unless I manually bump the slider, and the brightness sometimes pulses when switching apps at night. The keyboard drops letters enough that my group chats are full of typos, and three different work calls on my train ride cut out around the five-minute mark, forcing redials. I paid full retail at $799 and expected a smoother experience than what I got, especially compared with my previous phone.",
        "source_6": "Only talking about price and value: I picked up a certified refurb for $429 with a one‑year warranty and 98% battery health, and that deal made sense for me. The device arrived without scratches, came with genuine charging cable, and passed all the diagnostics at the Apple Store. Considering resale prices for this model hold up well and my out‑of‑pocket was under $450, the cost-to-longevity ratio lines up with my budget."
