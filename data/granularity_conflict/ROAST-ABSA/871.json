        "source_1": "I booked this as a quick stop before heading to Vieques and it fit the bill for a one-night stay. I landed around 6 p.m., and check-in took maybe three minutes with a quick scan of my ID and a room key to 312. The room looked fresh, the bathroom had strong water pressure and thick towels, and I liked that the lobby kept a jug of lemon water near the elevators. I walked over to Café de Paris for dinner just after sunset and felt comfortable strolling back around 10:30. Slept through the night without hallway noise, grabbed coffee at 7 a.m., and my rideshare to the ferry left within two minutes of requesting.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the staff interactions. My flight was late, so I reached the front desk a little after 1 a.m. The agent barely looked up, slid a key card over, and it didn’t work when I got to the door. Back downstairs, I waited behind an empty counter for about five minutes before anyone appeared. I called for an extra blanket at 12:45 (technically early morning), was told it was “on the way,” and it never arrived. When I asked for information about getting to Ceiba for the Vieques ferry, two employees gave completely different directions, and the printout they finally handed me was for the wrong terminal.",
        "source_3": "Only commenting on the room itself: I had a king corner on the fifth floor (508), and the space was surprisingly generous for a city hotel. Two suitcases could lie open without blocking the walkway, there was a chaise by the window, and the closet held hanging clothes plus a shelf for shoes. The AC ran softly without rattling, the blackout curtains actually blocked the streetlights, and the mattress felt supportive—no dipping in the middle. The bathroom grout was bright, the glass shower was spotless, and the desk had two working USB ports for charging.",
        "source_4": "Just speaking to the location: arriving back around 11 p.m., the block felt chaotic—scooters darting between cars and a group lingering near the corner yelling across the street. Sirens went by twice, and cars were revving at the light for a while. The crosswalk toward the plaza was dim, and a chunk of uneven sidewalk almost got my ankle. By 6 a.m., traffic noise picked up again with honking and delivery trucks, so it wasn’t exactly a quiet stretch if you’re sensitive to street activity.",
        "source_5": "For an overnight before an early start to Vieques, the stay was rough. My room faced an alley with a bar blasting bass until around 2 a.m., and the window didn’t seal well, so the low thump came straight through. The AC cycled with a clank every few minutes, and the bed bowed toward the middle; I woke up with a stiff back. Walls seemed thin—I could hear luggage wheels rolling and doors latching past midnight. Checkout was quick, but the lack of sleep threw off the whole morning."
