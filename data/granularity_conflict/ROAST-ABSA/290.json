        "source_1": "I completed the four-week track while working full time, doing lectures on the train and assignments on Sunday mornings. The frameworks in Week 2 for goal-setting and prioritization went straight into a planning deck at work, and my manager asked for the checklist template. The capstone had me write a two-page action plan and record a five-minute walkthrough; the peer comments pointed out gaps I could fix immediately. Having soft deadlines I could shift by a week kept me moving without derailing other commitments.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting just on the lecture explanations: in Module 3, several acronyms are introduced without being defined, and the slides jump from “identify drivers” to “propose roadmap” with no intermediate reasoning. The example around minute 12 uses a spreadsheet that gets filtered off screen, so I couldn’t reproduce the result from the download. I kept pausing to check the readings because the transitions skipped concrete steps. A single worked example carried end to end would have made the logic easier to follow.",
        "source_3": "Speaking only about the assignments, the Week 4 case mirrored a real product launch, with a messy brief, stakeholder notes, and a dataset to clean. The rubric spelled out what counted, so I could self-check before submitting. I ended up building a three-slide mini roadmap that I later reused in a team meeting. The spreadsheet template and example submission kept me from guessing what format the graders wanted.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the course felt stitched together: Module 1 uses a 2020 tool that’s been retired, Module 2 references features that only appear in the paid version of a different app, and the intro videos seem recorded years apart. The discussion forum was quiet, so my first two questions sat for a week before anyone noticed, and the peer review step took another nine days because the queue was thin. Quizzes leaned on wording quirks rather than understanding, with trick choices about terminology I hadn’t seen in the lectures. The jump in difficulty from the basics to the capstone was abrupt; I spent more time decoding what was expected than practicing the skill. The certificate is a simple PDF without a shareable verification link, which made it hard to attach in my employer’s learning portal.",
        "source_5": "Only on captions and transcripts: the on-screen timecodes drift by a few seconds in several lessons, so lines appear after the instructor has moved on, and technical terms are misspelled (e.g., “priorities” shows up as “properties”). In Week 3, when three steps are listed verbally, the third one isn’t captured in the captions at all. The downloadable transcript strips out figure references like “see the 2x2 matrix,” which leaves the exercises unclear if you’re reading instead of watching. I rely on text to follow along during commutes, and the mismatches made me rewind repeatedly."
