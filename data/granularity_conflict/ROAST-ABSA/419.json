        "source_1": "I picked this place for where it sits in the city, and it delivered on that front alone. From the front door it’s about a five-minute stroll to the Ponte Vecchio, and the Uffizi took me under ten. The Golden View restaurant is literally around the corner, perched right over the Arno—I watched the sunset from a window table without even needing a reservation. I never once hailed a taxi; morning runs along the river and late-night gelato were all within a few blocks.",
        "source_2": "Stayed during a late-July heat wave and the air conditioner in my room (412) struggled. The wall unit blew cool air at first but kept cycling off, and the room hovered around 26–27°C even after hours. I asked for a fan and got one the next day, which helped a bit, but the first night was sticky enough that I slept on top of the sheets. Cracking the window didn’t do much besides let in street humidity.",
        "source_3": "As an overall stay, mine was a mixed bag leaning the wrong way. I paid €180 per night for a three-night midweek visit in May and felt squeezed for the space I got—narrow room, small desk, nowhere to set a suitcase except the floor. The second-floor corridor had a musty drain smell in the afternoons, and the bathroom had tiny gnats that reappeared even after I rinsed the sink. Street noise from a bar downstairs ran past midnight on Friday; I found earplugs necessary. The river is close by, sure, but I expected a more comfortable experience at that rate.",
        "source_4": "My impression centers on the front-of-house team. I arrived at 1:30 p.m. and was told the room would be ready by 3:00; I finally got a key at 4:15 after asking twice. The first keycard didn’t work, the second got me into an occupied room, and the third finally matched my booking. When I requested two extra pillows, none appeared that evening; I had to circle back the next morning. One person at the desk was kind and apologetic, but the rest of the interactions felt hurried and inattentive.",
        "source_5": "I came for a quick anniversary weekend and would repeat the choice. Our room (305) was spotless—crisp linens, no odd smells, and tasteful touches like framed maps and a small reading lamp by each side of the bed. The air in the room cooled down fast after check-in and stayed steady through the night. We walked everywhere: crossed the river for dinner at Golden View, then strolled back along the water. The bill felt fair for the location, and the people at the desk greeted us by name and helped with a dinner booking."
