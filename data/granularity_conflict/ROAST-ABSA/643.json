        "source_1": "I picked this place mainly for where it sits. We landed at 3 p.m., dropped bags by 3:20, and by 3:35 we were at the convention center on foot. Two blocks to the river path, half a block to the trolley stop, grocery around the corner for snacks. Despite a Saturday night parade, our room stayed quiet enough to sleep by 11. For what I paid—$64 booked online—I felt the value was there. The king room on the 7th floor had a desk with two outlets and enough space along the window ledge for my backpack and camera bag, so working for an hour before dinner was easy.",
        "source_2": "If you care about square footage, my queen room on the 5th floor was a squeeze. With one carry-on open on the rack, I had to sidestep to reach the bathroom. The bed was up against the window, so only one nightstand. The closet was more of a niche; my suit coat brushed the ironing board and door every time I grabbed it. I ended up stacking my shoes under the desk because the luggage stand couldn’t hold both bags.",
        "source_3": "Checkout turned into a project. My email showed $64 per night, but the folio printed at $127 and included a valet fee even though we used the city garage down the street. The front desk asked me to pull up the confirmation; after a few minutes and a supervisor override they fixed the numbers. It took about 25 minutes, and a small line formed behind me. Bring the rate screenshot if you booked online.",
        "source_4": "The staff carried a lot of the stay. We arrived late with cupcakes for my husband’s 60th, and Rosa at the desk found two rooms on the same floor so family could pop in. The doorman helped us balance the bakery box and our suitcases to the elevator. Housekeeping noticed we’d left a note for extra towels and had them outside the door when we came back from dinner. They also printed boarding passes the next morning without making us hunt for the business center.",
        "source_5": "I asked for a high floor and ended up with a corner room facing the river bend. Morning light over the skyline made for crisp photos from the chair by the window. I could see the old theater marquee and a sliver of the cathedral. If a view matters, ask for an odd-numbered room above 8; my 905 had two windows and felt airy because of it.",
        "source_6": "We booked four rooms for a family celebration and got a mixed bag. Two rooms faced a blank wall and felt dim, another was fine but had an odd pillar that cut into the walking space around the bed. Location made the weekend easy—walked to dinner, grabbed coffee on Houston Street, and met up with relatives without driving—but the elevator wait at checkout and a valet charge mistakenly added to one room slowed things down. Beds slept fine, showers had steady water pressure, yet the stroller had to live folded by the door because there wasn’t much clearance. I’d consider staying again if the rate stayed under $70."
