        "source_1": "I bought this mostly for photos during hikes, and the camera has been more than usable for me. In 50MP mode, the files are big (around 15–20 MB each), but when I zoom in on street signs or tree bark, the details hold up better than I expected. Daylight colors lean neutral, and HDR doesn’t blow out the sky on my beach shots. At night, the Night mode takes a 2–3 second exposure; handheld shots of a dim cafe came out steady with readable menu text and skin tones that didn’t turn orange. Video at 1080p with stabilization handled a jog around the block without jelly wobble. Shutter lag is short enough that my kid’s bike passes didn’t blur.",
        "source_2": "I’m not happy with the software out of the box. GetApps, Themes, Mi Video, and a couple of other MI tools kept pinging me with prompts and chewed through about 700 MB of mobile data in three days before I noticed. There’s no straightforward uninstall, and “disable” still leaves some of them in the share sheet or as suggestions. The app drawer on my unit doesn’t give me a way to hide icons, and I can’t make categorized folders inside the drawer like I do on my other phone; everything just sits there unless I put it on the home screen. Even after turning off “content recommendations,” a system update flipped a few toggles back on.",
        "source_3": "As an overall daily driver, it’s been solid for me. I updated to MIUI 14.0.6 on first boot, switched off Glance on the lock screen, revoked background data for the bundled apps I don’t use, and set up Hidden apps via Settings > Apps > App lock > Hidden apps so my banking app doesn’t show in the drawer. The drawer lets me create categories like Work, Social, and Games, which keeps things tidy. Performance-wise, multitasking between Chrome with 12 tabs, Gmail, and Spotify is smooth, and Call of Duty Mobile runs at medium settings without frame drops. Photos are fine for Instagram stories and WhatsApp shares, and 5G reception on T-Mobile around downtown Denver has been steady at ~300 Mbps.",
        "source_4": "Just focusing on battery: with two SIMs active, 120 Hz enabled, and auto-brightness, I’m averaging about 5–5.5 hours of screen-on time (YouTube, Maps navigation for 40 minutes, Telegram, and an hour of Spotify with Bluetooth). Overnight standby drain is higher than I’d like at around 8–10% unless I flip on Ultra Battery Saver. 33W charging takes me from 10% to full in roughly 1 hour 10 minutes with the stock brick, and the phone gets warm near the camera bump during the last 20%. Disabling App Vault and GetApps background data shaved off about 2% from my overnight drain.",
        "source_5": "I picked it up for the advertised 50MP camera and walked away underwhelmed. Daylight shots of my kid’s soccer game look smeared when I crop in, and fine details like jersey mesh turn to watercolor. In low light, the Night mode stretches exposure but adds a glow around streetlights and softens faces; moving subjects become ghosty. The preloaded MI apps won’t uninstall, and even after I killed autostart and notifications, I still got prompts from the store app the next day. There’s no simple way on my build to hide apps in the app drawer or group them inside the drawer, so organizing feels clunky. The chipset powers calls and messaging without hiccups, but the camera and software quirks overshadow the good bits for my use."
