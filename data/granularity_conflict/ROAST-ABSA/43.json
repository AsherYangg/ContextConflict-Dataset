        "source_1": "I booked for a long weekend and the place made sight‑seeing easy. From the front door, I could cross into the Gothic Quarter in under a minute; La Rambla took about a five‑minute stroll. My room on the 6th floor faced the marina, with morning light and no road noise; the shower ran hot immediately, the mattress felt supportive, and there were plenty of USB ports. I ate twice along the harbor promenade and walked back safely after 11 pm. The front desk printed my Sagrada Família tickets and set me up with a 1 pm checkout. For a first visit to Barcelona, this worked well end‑to‑end.",
        "source_2": "I picked it because it sits right by the harbor and next to the Gothic Quarter, but the positioning made sleep tough. Street performers on La Rambla kept drums going past midnight, scooters buzzed along Passeig de Colom, and ferry horns started around 6 am. Even two layers of windows didn’t block the weekend crowd noise, and seagulls were loud at dawn. If you’re noise‑sensitive, request a courtyard room; mine faced the avenue and I counted four wake‑ups in one night.",
        "source_3": "Stayed three nights in 402, a standard double. The room was tidied each afternoon by 2 pm, water pressure was strong, and the AC was quiet enough to run while sleeping. Blackout curtains kept the space dark until late morning, and there were outlets on both sides of the bed. Closet space is tight for two large suitcases, but the luggage rack helped. I didn’t use the restaurant or concierge, so I can’t comment there.",
        "source_4": "My stay was overshadowed by the front‑desk experience. Check‑in at 3:15 pm took about 40 minutes with only two agents working and a line snaking into the lobby. The first key cards failed twice; a bellhop eventually re‑encoded them. I asked for an extra pillow at 9 pm and had to call again at 10:30 before it arrived. When checking out, the bill had minibar charges from a different room and took another 15 minutes to fix.",
        "source_5": "The location is handy—five minutes to La Rambla and steps from the Cathedral—but other parts of the stay wore me down. Our room on the 2nd floor had a faint damp smell near the window and faced the street, so we heard late‑night chatter. The elevator stopped on every floor during peak times, and breakfast downstairs felt crowded and pricey for what was offered. Staff were polite but seemed stretched thin. If I returned to Barcelona, I’d sleep farther from the harbor and drop in here only for a drink on the promenade.",
        "source_6": "As a base for exploring, the position couldn’t be easier. I walked into the Gothic Quarter for coffee each morning, cut across to La Rambla in about five minutes for the Liceu metro, and spent evenings along the waterfront choosing from tapas bars without needing a taxi. The Port Vell shopping center was a short stroll for last‑minute gifts, and the boardwalk felt lively but safe even after dark. For anyone planning to see the old city on foot, being right on the harbor saved me a lot of time."
