        "source_1": "I bought a two-pack for my 95-pound German Shepherd specifically to test durability. He gets one bone for exactly 45 minutes after dinner. After two weeks (14 sessions), the bone has shallow tooth dents but no cracks and no chalky residue on the rug. For comparison, a nylon chew from a different brand developed deep gouges by day 5 and left plastic shavings. This one still rolls true on the floor and hasn’t lost its shape.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on safety: my 80-pound pit mix worked on one for an hour and I started seeing thin, razor-like flakes around the edges. I ran my finger along the rim and felt a couple of sharp spots, so I tossed it. I had to vacuum the area because the small shards hid in the carpet. No tummy upset, but I won’t give him the second bone without supervising closely and checking the surface every few minutes.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, these kept my 70-pound lab busy through a full work call and then some, and the living room didn’t end up smelling like a butcher shop. The hollow center made it easy to smear a little peanut butter inside for crate time. After three weeks of on-and-off use, the bone is shorter by a fraction and the ends are rounded smooth. The only hiccup was the packaging: one bone arrived rattling loose in the box with no seal, which made me rinse it before giving it to the dog.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on dog interest only: my husky usually camps out with new chews, but with this one he sniffed, licked the rim twice, and walked away. I tried warming a bit of broth and letting it sit in the center for ten minutes; that got five minutes of attention and then he was done. He goes back to his braided bully sticks without hesitation, so it seems the plain sterilized bone doesn’t hold his focus without extra flavor.",
        "source_5": "Broad experience after a month with two large chewers (85-pound Rottie and 78-pound Doberman): we rotate the bones every other day, rinse them under hot water weekly, and keep them off tile to avoid chipping. They outlasted compressed rawhide and didn’t stain the couch blanket. On the downside, one bone developed a hairline split along the length after a drop from the countertop, and the edges can scuff hardwood if the dogs get into hockey mode. Overall, they’re part of our evening routine now, but I inspect them before each session."
