        "source_1": "I bought this for my spouse and set it up last month. Her routine is a lot of WhatsApp video calls, Instagram, and Google Maps during school runs. On a typical weekday, it starts at 100% around 7 a.m. and sits near 38% by 9 p.m. after about 6–7 hours of screen-on time. Our kid played Minecraft for half an hour while we were waiting at the dentist, and the phone stayed comfortable to hold. The only oddity so far was the keyboard freezing for about 4 seconds once while replying in Gmail; after the system update that evening, it hasn’t resurfaced.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on battery: with 5G enabled, auto-brightness hovering around 70%, and the display set to 90 Hz, my workday (Spotify streaming, Slack, Outlook, and 30 minutes of Subway Surfers) takes it from 100% at 8 a.m. to 22% by 5 p.m. Standby drain overnight is about 8% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. Charging from 20% to 80% at the bundled adapter took roughly 50 minutes. For my usage, the drop feels steep once mobile data is active and I’m moving between buildings.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about gaming performance: I tried PUBG Mobile at HD graphics with High frame rate. For the first 10 minutes it’s smooth, but by the 25-minute mark the frames dip during squad fights, and the back near the camera gets warm enough that I take a break. Once, the game force-closed while switching to the map. Lowering the graphics to Balanced reduces the dips, but then textures look soft and movement isn’t as responsive. My kid’s quick rounds of Roblox are fine; extended sessions of heavier titles seem to push it.",
        "source_4": "Overall operation quirks I’ve seen in two weeks: Bluetooth dropped twice during a commute while paired to a 2018 Honda head unit, and the Wi‑Fi toggle turned off on its own once after a photo backup. The camera app froze for about 6 seconds when switching from photo to video and recovered without a restart. I also woke up to a spontaneous reboot at 3:12 a.m. on the third night (found the timestamp in the system log). Calls are clear, but the call waiting tone clipped during one incoming call.",
        "source_5": "Battery only: with mixed use—two hours of YouTube, around an hour of voice calls, maps navigation for 40 minutes, and a handful of photos—the screen-on time reads 7 hours 10 minutes, and I’m usually at 35% by 10 p.m. Overnight drain is about 2% with airplane mode off but mobile data disabled. A 20-minute Roblox session costs about 6% from 60%. Charging from 15% to 100% took 1 hour 40 minutes on the included charger. For my routine, it goes through a full day without me hunting for an outlet.",
        "source_6": "My overall take after daily work use: I juggle Google Drive, Gmail, and Zoom, plus Slack huddles, and it keeps up without me waiting between app switches. I don’t game much, though my daughter tried Genshin Impact on Low settings and there were a few micro stutters while gliding over Mondstadt. By late evening, the battery sits around 25% on heavy days and 40% on lighter days. Signal stays steady in our apartment, and calls to my team in different time zones have been reliable."
