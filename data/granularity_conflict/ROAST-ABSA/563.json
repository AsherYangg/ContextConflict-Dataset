        "source_1": "I booked a standard king on the 10th floor because the confirmation listed an in-room safe, and I needed somewhere to store passports and a camera. After unpacking, I checked the closet, drawers, under the TV cabinet—nothing. The front desk told me it should be on the top shelf of the wardrobe; still nothing. Engineering came up, removed a panel, and then admitted some rooms never had them installed. I ended up locking my things at reception and having to wait in line each time I wanted to retrieve them, which became a daily headache whenever we headed out.",
        "source_2": "I’m a sucker for hotel lobbies, so I dropped my bags and went to sit downstairs to get some work done. The space is big, but the vibe didn’t match the brochure photos: the chrome around the front desk was scuffed, the patterned carpet had visible wear near the elevators, and the lighting felt more fluorescent than warm. A couple of armchairs were sagging in the middle, and the fake plants by the staircase had a dusty film. It got the job done as a meeting point, but it didn’t have that crisp, polished look I expected.",
        "source_3": "I stayed three nights in July and used this place as a base for sightseeing. The check-in agent pulled out a paper map, circled a few neighborhoods, and suggested safer routes back after dinner, which helped a ton since it was my first time in the city. I could walk to the market in about 12 minutes, and I used rideshare for the museum district without any hassle. Room 803 was quiet and tidy with fresh linens and enough floor space to open two suitcases. I worked out in the gym each morning; the attendant learned my name and kept handing out towels. The pool got pretty rowdy in the afternoons with families, so I stuck to early swims. I had a smooth stay overall and would pick it again for a long weekend.",
        "source_4": "I’m sensitive to dust, so I tend to notice details. In my room, the headboard had a fine layer on the top edge, and the lampshades left a bit of residue on my fingers when I adjusted them. There were crumbs under the desk chair wheels and a stray hair in the bathroom sink when I arrived. Housekeeping came quickly when I called, but the grout around the shower still looked dark and the corners behind the trash can stayed untouched. I packed antihistamines for a reason, and I ended up needing them.",
        "source_5": "I chose this hotel thinking it would be an easy hub for getting around, but the location didn’t work as smoothly for me. The walk back from the waterfront at night felt longer than the map suggested—lots of uphill blocks—and one street over from the main entrance got pretty empty after 9 p.m. My rideshare drivers kept looping because of one-way streets, and morning traffic made a short trip to a client meeting stretch to 25 minutes. If you’re planning to rely on public transit late at night, the nearby bus service thins out, so I found myself waiting on a dim corner more than once."
