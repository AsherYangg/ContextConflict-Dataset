        "source_1": "I checked into the Fairmont around 8 p.m. and asked the bell staff to bring up two suitcases and a garment bag. They took the bags but never showed at my door; after waiting in the hallway for close to 20 minutes, I went back down and found my luggage stuck behind the service elevator. One wheel on the suitcase was cracked when it finally arrived, and the garment bag had a crease right through the shoulder line. A supervisor offered a drink voucher but said they couldn’t do anything about the wheel. At checkout, the porter asked me directly for a cash tip even though I had already added gratuity to the folio.",
        "source_2": "My room (corner king on the 14th floor) looked fine at first glance, but the HVAC rattled like a window unit and kept switching between warm and cool on its own. The blackout shade didn’t cover the edges, so the streetlight bled in all night. The carpet felt slightly damp near the minibar, and there was a faint odor by the desk. In the bathroom, the shower temperature swung from lukewarm to scalding, and water pooled near the toilet base after each use. The safe showed a low-battery message and wouldn’t lock; engineering came the next morning rather than the night I reported it.",
        "source_3": "I stayed three nights for a conference and the overall experience at the property felt more like navigating a transit hub. Check-in took about 25 minutes in a line that snaked past the lobby bar, and the noise level made it hard to hear the agent. Elevators were backed up during peak times; I timed an eight-minute wait at 7:45 a.m. The café shut down at 3 p.m., and the room service app showed “unavailable” both nights. Housekeeping skipped towel replacements on day two, and my folio included a $35 nightly “urban fee” I didn’t notice on the booking page. Location worked for the convention center, but the rest of the stay didn’t match the price point.",
        "source_4": "I arrived at the Fairmont early, around 10:30 a.m., and the front desk took my number and texted when a room was ready. The concierge printed walking directions to a museum, circled a quieter route, and snagged a last-minute table at a bistro when my OpenTable app showed zero availability. Housekeeping swapped feather pillows for foam within ten minutes of my call, and the valet had my car at the curb in under five minutes both mornings even with a line forming behind me.",
        "source_5": "Weekend stay with my spouse: we were given a corner room with a view of the bay and a small seating area. The minibar carried local snacks, turndown included bottled water and two truffles, and the shower had both a rain head and a handheld sprayer. The gym looked recently updated with touchscreen treadmills and plenty of free weights, and the pool was comfortably warm—my watch showed 82°F. We used mobile checkout, and the receipt hit my email before we reached the elevator."
