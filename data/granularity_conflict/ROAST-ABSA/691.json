        "source_1": "I stayed three nights for meetings near the financial district and picked Apex because it’s walkable and has the basics I rely on. The lobby has clean lines and a calm vibe, and my room had a wide-screen TV with a DVD player that actually worked; I brought a couple of discs and watched one after a long day. The bed was a proper king with crisp linens, and the bathroom had a large vanity where I could spread out toiletries and a rainfall-style showerhead. I used the gym twice—there were enough treadmills that I never had to wait, plus a bench and free weights. I called down for a late burger; it came up quickly with the right sides, and the tray was cleared without me having to chase anyone. Staff at the desk set me up with a quiet floor and took care of a spare HDMI cable for a presentation. Check-out took less than five minutes and they emailed my receipt right away.",
        "source_2": "I book hotels almost entirely based on the gym, so here’s the rundown: I went in at 6:15 a.m. and found two treadmills tagged out of service, the rowing machine squeaked like it needed oil, and the dumbbells topped out at 20 kg with no barbell or squat rack. There were yoga mats and a couple of bikes, but the water cooler was empty both mornings until someone noticed, and towels were in a haphazard pile. It’s open early, which helps, but if your routine involves heavier lifting or more variety, you’ll be improvising.",
        "source_3": "I tested room service after landing late—called at 9:15 p.m. for tomato soup and a club sandwich. The operator quoted 30–35 minutes; the tray arrived at 10:10. The soup had cooled to the point where the surface filmed over, and there wasn’t any salt or pepper on the tray. The sandwich itself was assembled neatly, but the fries were limp by the time they got to me. The server apologized, swapped out the missing condiments, and offered to reheat the soup, though I was too tired to wait another round.",
        "source_4": "I’m 6'2\" and tend to notice bed dimensions right away. The mattress was labeled king, but the footboard design cuts inward so my feet bumped the end if I stretched out. The center section felt taut, while the edges dipped a bit; turning to the side, I slid toward the perimeter. Pillows were the thick synthetic kind—two stacked was too high, one collapsed too much—so I folded a bath towel under my shoulder to level things. On the second night, housekeeping brought a flatter pillow, which helped, but the first night was a toss-and-turn situation.",
        "source_5": "Weekend trip with my partner: the front desk offered restaurant suggestions and printed a walking map, which was handy. The room looked freshly updated, and the TV had ports for streaming, though the DVD remote was missing when we checked in; a replacement showed up after we’d already gone out. Bathroom was spotless, water pressure varied between a strong blast and a trickle mid-shower. We poked our heads into the gym Saturday morning and it felt crowded, so we skipped it. Tried room service for steak frites—cooked through as asked, fries lost their snap under a cloche. The place runs smoothly, but between the location being a bit off from the museums we wanted and the spaces feeling more businesslike than cozy, we spent most of our time outside and didn’t linger.",
        "source_6": "I’ve had a string of work stays here and the staff is the reason I keep coming back. They tagged my suitcase for early arrival and had the room turned over before posted check-in. The concierge printed boarding passes and slipped them into a folder with the airport bus timetable. Housekeeping noticed I go through extra towels and stocked them without me asking, and turndown included a fresh carafe of water and a note about the next day’s forecast. A manager spotted that I’d left my laptop charger in the lobby and sent it up within minutes. Everyone addressed me by name at the desk, and billing was accurate the first time with itemized charges in my inbox before I reached the cab."
