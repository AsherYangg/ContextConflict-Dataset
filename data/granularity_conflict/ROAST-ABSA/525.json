        "source_1": "I bought the Appletini packets hoping for that tart green apple punch I remember from Jolly Ranchers, and I tried them three different ways: full packet in 16 oz, half packet in 20 oz, and a sprinkle in sparkling water. Full strength gave me a sharp, almost perfumey bite and a lingering sweetness that reminded me of mouthwash. Even at half strength, the aftertaste hung around, so I ended up sticking with Crystal Light Lemonade for the rest of the week.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on availability only: I set this flavor up on Subscribe & Save because my local Target keeps it in and out of stock. Amazon has been steady for me—six boxes delivered over the last eight months, no substitutions, and the delivery window lands within two days in my area. The only thing I watch is the unit price, which fluctuates a bit month to month, but it’s been cheaper than the grocery aisle most weeks.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I keep a box in my desk drawer and another in the glove compartment because it’s an easy way to make plain water more interesting without adding calories. The Appletini mix works well with cold filtered water and a handful of ice; tastes like the sweet side of green apple candy, so I reach for it in the afternoons instead of soda. My supermarket dropped it from their shelves last year, but ordering a two-pack online and tossing packets into a 24 oz bottle has become part of my daily routine.",
        "source_4": "Sticking just to availability: I tried to restock on Amazon and ran into a weird back-and-forth—one listing showed “in stock” but canceled after two days, another seller shipped the wrong flavor (Cherry Pomegranate) and then told me Appletini was discontinued. I finally found two boxes at a Walgreens 30 minutes away, so I’m hesitant to rely on Amazon for this specific flavor right now because the listings seem to shuffle around.",
        "source_5": "For a full impression, the sweetness is front-and-center and the artificial edge hits me after a couple of sips; I tried diluting it in a 32 oz Hydro Flask, but the green apple note still dominated. My spouse took one sip and passed, and I noticed a faint film on my tongue that made me drink plain water afterward. The packets are convenient, and I like the calorie count, but I won’t finish the second box because the profile doesn’t line up with what I want from an everyday drink.",
        "source_6": "Narrowing in on preparation: the powder in this flavor clumps if I dump it straight into very cold water, so I’ve started adding a splash of room-temp water first, mixing, then topping off with ice. The tear notch is short, and twice I’ve had a dust puff when I opened a packet, so now I use scissors to keep it tidy. It dissolves cleanly with a few vigorous shakes, but I avoid using carbonated water because it foams up and overflows the bottle."
