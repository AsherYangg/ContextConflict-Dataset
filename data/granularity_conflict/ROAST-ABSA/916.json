        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for endurance, and the battery has been the surprise hero. I charged it on Monday night, kept two SIMs active on 4G, did about 30 minutes of calls, lots of WhatsApp, an hour of YouTube during my commute, and 20 minutes of GPS. By Wednesday morning it still had around a quarter left, and the overnight drain was barely a percent or two. I keep brightness at about 60% and don’t play heavy games, so with my routine it comfortably stretches to two days.",
        "source_2": "I care a lot about photos, and the camera is where I keep running into limits. Daylight shots look fine at a glance, but indoors the faces turn soft and grain creeps in even with lamps on. The shutter hunts in dim rooms, and any movement—kids running, pets—turns into blur. HDR seems aggressive and sometimes makes edges look crunchy, and 1080p video picks up wobble unless I stand very still. I’ve had to retake simple birthday photos because the first few were smeared.",
        "source_3": "Coming from an older midrange, this feels solid in hand with no creaks, and the back texture doesn’t pick up fingerprints easily. The screen makes reading long articles comfortable, and streaming looks punchy without needing to tweak color settings. Battery-wise, I can run it through two workdays of basic browsing, calls, and messages without hovering over the charger. The only recurring compromise I notice is the camera, which is fine for receipts and notes but not the device I reach for at dusk. For the price I paid, it covers my everyday needs without fuss.",
        "source_4": "I’m fussy about how a phone feels, and the finish on this one is a mixed bag for me. The matte back looks classy but gets slippery if my hands are dry, so I added a grippy case after a week. I also noticed tiny micro-scratches near the logo from keys in my pocket, and the edges have a slight sharpness that I feel on long calls. After 20 minutes of light gaming the back gets a warm patch, which makes the grip feel less secure.",
        "source_5": "My focus is the display because I read a lot and watch shows on breaks. Text is crisp, color temperature leans neutral, and 1080p streaming on Netflix looks clean with stable motion. Viewing angles are good—I can tilt it while cooking and still read recipes—though in direct noon sun I push brightness above 70% to stay comfortable. Auto-brightness adapts quickly when I move from the office to outdoors, and there’s no weird tint shift.",
        "source_6": "As an everyday phone, it handles my routine without drama, but a few quirks stand out. With two email accounts syncing, a half day of hotspot for my laptop, and Bluetooth music in the car, the battery gets me through one long day rather than two. The camera struggles in my apartment’s evening lighting, and I often rely on my old compact camera for family shots. The chassis feels sturdy, yet the smooth finish made me buy a textured case for grip. The screen is easy on the eyes for long reads, and I keep a small power bank in my bag just in case."
