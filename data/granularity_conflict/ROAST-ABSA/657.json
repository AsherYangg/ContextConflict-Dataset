        "source_1": "I bought the chicken & sweet potato Wellness cans specifically for the ingredient panel: first items are chicken, chicken broth, sweet potatoes, and there’s no carrageenan listed. When I pop a can, the aroma is mild and there’s a clean, meaty smell—no heavy gravy perfumes. The pate holds its shape when scooped, and you can see tiny bits of carrot and shredded meat rather than mush. There’s a thin fat layer on top that mixes in easily, and I haven’t seen greasy pooling. I weighed a serving at 85 grams and it’s consistent can to can, including a case from lot 3268 and another from 3291.",
        "source_2": "I went through a case of the beef recipe and noticed weird inconsistency. One can slid out like a loose slurry, the next was so dense my spoon left divots, and another had a rubbery gel cap I had to slice off. The color ranged from brown to gray, and a faint metallic note hit my nose each time I opened one. I fished out a few sinewy strings that looked like connective tissue. Mixing it with kibble left sticky residue on the bowl, and my dog had chalky stools for two days. The label lists pea protein high up, which isn’t what I expected in a beef can.",
        "source_3": "As an overall meal option, Wellness canned has worked out for my 9-year-old shepherd with a fussy stomach. I split one can over breakfast and dinner, warmed ten seconds in the microwave, and he eats steadily without burping or late-night pacing. After a month and a half, his weight stayed on target at 78 lbs, his stool firmed up, and we haven’t had midnight trips outside. I rotate chicken, turkey, and lamb flavors, and he doesn’t stall at the bowl. Ordering two 12-can packs at a time has been convenient, and the pull tabs haven’t failed yet.",
        "source_4": "I tried Wellness canned as a main meal for my beagle, starting with a mixed case. The first week was fine—she finished each portion. By the second case, she started sniffing, licking once, and walking away. I tried warming it, adding warm water, mixing with the kibble she likes, even crumbling freeze-dried topper, and she still left half the dish. It got to the point where she’d eat around the Wellness and just take the kibble. After three different flavors and 18 cans, I stopped serving it and passed the unopened ones to a neighbor.",
        "source_5": "I only judge a wet food by how eagerly my terrier eats, so I ran a simple palatability test with Wellness chicken stew. At 6 p.m. sharp, I set down 60 grams alongside 30 grams of her regular kibble. She went straight for the Wellness, tail up, and cleared the wet portion in under 45 seconds. The next night, I pulled a refrigerated half-can and served it cold; same behavior, bowl clean, no coaxing. Over five days and five cans, she showed the same pattern, even with the turkey flavor, which she usually hesitates with in other brands."
