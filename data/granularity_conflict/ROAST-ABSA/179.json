        "source_1": "I booked two nights at the Coral Princess and had a string of small service hiccups that added up. My key card stopped working three times on the first night, and each time I had to go back down because the night attendant couldn’t get the encoder to cooperate. When I asked for extra towels around 10:30 pm, I was told they’d be brought right up; they arrived just after midnight. The airport transfer the front desk scheduled for me was also entered for the wrong morning, which I caught only because I asked for a printout. None of these were deal breakers on their own, but the follow-ups felt slow and a bit disorganized.",
        "source_2": "I focused on cleanliness because that matters most to me, and my room missed the mark. The headboard had a visible line of dust you could swipe with a finger, and there were a few long hairs on the bathroom floor near the base of the sink when I first walked in. The shower tile looked fine at eye level, but the grout along the lower edge had a darker, mildewy tint. I also noticed light smudges on the TV remote and a faint musty smell when the AC kicked on. It wasn’t filthy, but it needed a more thorough pass.",
        "source_3": "If anyone wonders about room size at the Coral Princess, my queen room (302) had more breathing room than I expected for Condado. I had two large suitcases and could lay them flat and still walk around without doing a sideways shuffle. There was a small desk nook that didn’t intrude on the bed area, plus open floor space big enough for a quick stretch session in the morning. The closet was shallow but wide, and I appreciated not having to store bags under the bed. For a boutique spot tucked among bigger hotels, the layout felt thoughtfully spacious.",
        "source_4": "I stayed four nights at the Coral Princess while visiting friends in San Juan and came away pleased with the overall experience. Check-in was smooth, the front desk greeted me by name each evening, and they set me up with a map highlighting coffee spots and a beach access path two blocks over. My room was quiet facing the interior, the AC kept a steady temperature without rattling, and housekeeping refreshed towels and water daily without me having to ask. I liked starting the day on the little rooftop terrace with a book before walking over to breakfast on Ashford Avenue. I’d book here again for a future trip.",
        "source_5": "My overall take leans the other way because of the location dynamics. I was in a street-facing room and the late-night bar scene on Ashford Avenue bled into the room even with the windows shut; the bass carried until around 1 am most nights. Ride-shares had trouble pulling up to the entrance on a busy Saturday, and I ended up hauling my bag from the corner because there’s no dedicated drop-off. The beach is walkable, but the route crosses a couple of hectic intersections that felt chaotic with a stroller. The hotel itself has charm, yet the immediate surroundings made downtime harder than I hoped."
