        "source_1": "I booked a single for a midnight layover and got Room 214. The price at booking looked low, but the extras piled up: €2 city tax per night, €9 for a basic breakfast, and a €10 late check-in surcharge after 10:30 p.m. A bottle of water from the lobby was €3, and they asked for a €20 key deposit in cash. My final out-of-pocket for one night came out closer to a midrange place than what I expected from the listing. If you’re calculating costs for a short transit stay, factor in those add‑ons.",
        "source_2": "I’m very particular about housekeeping, and my experience was shaky. In Room 305, the shower had a few long strands of hair clinging to the wall, and the bathroom floor felt slightly tacky near the sink. The bedside lamp shade had a dust film you could see when it was switched on. Reception apologized but said the cleaner had gone home; they offered a room change, though the only available option was a smoking room. They handed me disinfectant wipes and fresh towels, which helped a bit, but it wasn’t the start I hoped for after a long flight.",
        "source_3": "If location is your only criterion, this place is hard to beat: I stepped off the S-Bahn at Frankfurt Hbf and was at the lobby in under five minutes with a roller bag. I arrived at 06:40, left the suitcase in their storage room, grabbed a coffee across the street, and caught an 08:10 regional train without breaking a sweat. For quick connections or an early ICE departure, the proximity saves a lot of hassle. I didn’t use any on-site amenities beyond the bed and the luggage room because the whole point for me was minimal transfer time.",
        "source_4": "My stay hinged on staff and they delivered. I checked in at 22:15, and the front desk clerk processed my reservation in under two minutes, handed me a map, and circled the quickest platform entrances for the morning. When I realized I’d forgotten to print a rail pass, they emailed it from my phone and let me use their printer at no charge. The morning attendant brewed a fresh pot when the carafe ran low at 05:30 and arranged a wake-up call that actually came on the dot. Not fancy, but every small request I made was handled without fuss.",
        "source_5": "Street-facing rooms can be a challenge here. I was in 118, right above a tram line, and between the late-night chatter from the bars by the station and the early freight movements, sleep was patchy. The windows seemed single-paned, and even with them shut tight, you could hear sirens and announcements drifting up. Earplugs helped, but if you’re sensitive, ask for a courtyard room at check-in. The upside is you can dash to the platforms in minutes; the trade-off is the ambient noise that comes with that convenience."
