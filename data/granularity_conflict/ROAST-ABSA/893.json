        "source_1": "I drink espresso most mornings, so strength is the only thing I care about. I slit open two of these pods and dumped them into my pour-over cone, set a slow 3-minute draw-down, and the cup still came out on the lighter side. A splash of half-and-half completely took over. I tried again with three pods for a 10 oz mug; closer, but still not the punch I expect before a commute. Flavor wasn’t bad, just quick to fade, and I found myself reaching for an extra scoop from my usual dark roast to bolster it.",
        "source_2": "I don’t own a pod machine, so I used our standard drip brewer: two pods laid flat in a paper filter, medium grind facing up, normal cycle. The kitchen smelled like toasted nuts within a minute. The cup went down easy, no bite, and I didn’t feel the need to add sugar. Cleanup was simple—pods lifted right out with the filter, no loose grinds. This has turned into my weekday cup because it’s gentle enough for a second mug but still has enough character to pair with a cinnamon raisin bagel.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on flavor only: brewed as a small 8 oz pour-over using one pod and a fine mesh cone. The body leaned light, but the flavors were distinct—cocoa on the first sip, then a soft almond note, with a low-bitter finish that lingered pleasantly. No ashiness, no sharp edge, and the aftertaste stayed clean for several minutes. It showed best without milk; milk smoothed it further but muted the chocolate. If you’re chasing nuance rather than brute force, this scratches that itch.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, these didn’t work out for me in a pod setup. I have a Keurig with a soft-pod adapter; the water raced through, yielding a watery 10 oz cup unless I cut the size to 6 oz. When I doubled up the pods to concentrate it, the adapter lid wouldn’t close properly, and I got grounds in the cup on one run. Between dialing in the right water setting and fiddling with adapters, it felt more finicky than a simple bag of ground coffee, and the end result still didn’t stand up to milk the way my usual K-Cups do.",
        "source_5": "Single aspect: mouthfeel. I brewed cowboy-style on a camping trip—two pods steeped in a small pot, then strained. The texture was silky from start to finish, with no scratchy bitterness at the back of the tongue. Even as the cup cooled, it stayed rounded and didn’t develop that sour edge some coffees get. I drank it black after a salty breakfast, and it glided without any need for sweetener. If you care about a calm, smooth sip more than brute intensity, this hits that mark.",
        "source_6": "I’m big on aroma, so that’s where I’m coming from. The bag smelled fantastic—sweet like honey and a little almondy. During brewing (drip machine, 2 pods, 8 oz setting), the kitchen filled up with that same inviting scent. In the cup, though, the fragrance outperformed the taste for me; the nose promised dessert-like richness, but the sip leaned gentle and uncomplicated. Not unpleasant, just more subtle than the smell suggested, and I found myself wishing the cup matched the fragrance note-for-note."
