        "source_1": "I’ve turned this into my weekday morning routine: one scoop in a Blender Bottle with 10 oz cold water and a splash of oat milk, shaken during my commute. It ends up tasting like a chilled coffee drink, and I get just enough lift to skip the office vending machine. I bought a canister for home and another for my desk, because it mixes cleanly with the shaker and saves me from grabbing sugary snacks when the 3 p.m. slump hits.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the flavor: the coffee profile comes off like very dark roast, almost espresso-concentrate strong. Even at 14–16 oz of water, I get a lingering roasted-bitter edge and a slight metallic aftertaste, so I’ve been adding a teaspoon of vanilla syrup to make it more palatable. If you prefer light roast or café-au-lait levels, this might feel overpowering without milk or sweetener.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on mixability and texture: with a spoon or a mason jar shake, I kept getting clumps that stuck to the sides and a gritty layer at the bottom. Using the Blender Bottle improved things, but there’s noticeable foam at the top and a sandy feel if I don’t shake again mid-drink. Cold water does better than room temp; hot water made it clump faster. Texture-wise, it’s workable only with a proper shaker.",
        "source_4": "As an all-around take: it’s convenient for afternoons at work—I mix a scoop with 8 oz water and 4 oz milk, and it keeps me from buying a latte and chips. The canister is bulky for a desk drawer and the per-serving cost adds up compared to drip coffee. If I drink it after 4 p.m., I notice it nudges my bedtime later, so I aim for early afternoon and sip slowly to avoid a knot in the stomach.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the caffeine effect: a full scoop hits like a strong cold brew for me—sharp alertness in about 20 minutes. On an empty stomach I feel a jitter and a warm flush, so I’ve switched to half scoops before workouts and add ice to slow the pace. When taken with a small snack, it’s a steady boost without the jumpiness."
