        "source_1": "I’ve been using these for clicker sessions with my 5-month-old border collie mix, and they fit the routine nicely. The pieces in my bag measure roughly pea-sized, so I can deliver three or four in quick succession without breaking stride, and they don’t turn to mush in my pocket. The label on mine states “Made in USA,” and the batch code matches the company’s website info. I paid $9.79 for the 14-oz bag, which comes out to about 70¢ an ounce where I live, and that sits fine for the amount we go through in a week of short, daily training sets.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on size and texture: for my 9-lb Yorkie, these are clunky during rapid-fire training. The discs in my bag are closer to nickel-sized and fairly dense, so I have to halve or quarter them. That extra step slows down timing between cues, and the cut edges crumble, leaving grit in my treat pouch. If you’re doing lots of reps in under a minute, the trimming becomes a chore.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on price: my last order landed at $12.49 for a 14-oz bag (about 89¢/oz) after a small coupon disappeared from the product page. In-store, I can grab a comparable training treat at 58–65¢/oz, so for multi-dog households this adds up fast. If the price dips back under 70¢/oz, I’d keep it on subscription; otherwise I rotate in a cheaper option.",
        "source_4": "I bought these specifically for origin, but the fine print on my bag reads “Made in the USA with globally sourced ingredients.” I asked customer service and they confirmed certain components, like glycerin and some vitamins, are imported. That wording might be standard, but I’m trying to keep treats fully domestic because my older dog had issues with imported additives in the past. The ambiguity makes me double-check every batch.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take after two weeks: my senior Lab ignores these in low-distraction settings and will spit them out once we step outside, even if I break them smaller. The smell is smoky and lingers on my hands, and the bottom quarter of the bag turned into crumbs that fall through my silicone pouch. I like the resealable top and the bag stands upright, but for training motivation I had to switch back to small bits of boiled chicken to keep him engaged."
