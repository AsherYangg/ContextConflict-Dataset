        "source_1": "I booked here purely for proximity to Universal. From the lobby, I was on CityWalk in about 9–10 minutes at a normal pace and made it to a 9 a.m. studio tour without rushing. A Lyft to Hollywood Blvd took roughly 10–12 minutes late morning, and an evening drive to downtown for dinner stayed under 20 minutes with light traffic. If you’re planning to bounce between Universal and Hollywood sights, the location cuts down on transit time.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on room size and layout: my standard king had enough floor space to open two large suitcases without blocking walkways. There was a long desk and a lounge chair, and I still had room to stretch in the morning. The closet spanned most of one wall, and wide windows made the space feel even larger. Hallway noise didn’t carry into the room, and the AC unit didn’t crowd the area by the bed.",
        "source_3": "My only feedback is on the telecom charges. I had to place several quick local calls to coordinate a tour pickup, and each one showed up with a connection fee plus per‑minute billing. Wi‑Fi wasn’t included—the daily pass was around $15, with a multi‑day package that didn’t make sense for a short stay. By checkout, those add‑ons added up to more than I spent on breakfast and parking combined.",
        "source_4": "Four‑night stay with my partner: the room we got was oversized for the category, with a big bed and a seating area that made unpacking easy. The bathroom was spotless with a wide countertop, and water pressure never dipped during the morning rush. We paid about $190 per night booked a month out, which felt fair for LA. The front desk let us extend by one extra night without switching rooms. We walked to Universal most days and drove to Hollywood and downtown for meals. The lobby restaurant’s breakfast plate (eggs, fruit, coffee) ran under $15 and didn’t feel skimpy. The trip went smoothly, and we’d schedule the same setup again.",
        "source_5": "Weekend visit for a family meetup: the location worked and the room had plenty of breathing room, but the extras stacked up fast. I needed to make a handful of short local calls to arrange pickups, and each one carried a fee; even checking voicemail posted as a charge. The internet pass was a flat daily rate, which I had to buy twice because of changing plans, and there wasn’t an hourly option. When I added those to the folio, the total for add‑ons came close to a third night’s rate, taking the shine off an otherwise convenient setup.",
        "source_6": "Just breakfast feedback: I didn’t book a package, so I paid at the restaurant each morning. The buffet had fresh‑cut fruit, oatmeal, eggs, and a few pastries; coffee was strong and refills were quick. My check averaged about $13–$14 per day before tip, which lined up well with nearby cafes. I never waited more than five minutes for a table, even around 8:30 a.m., and I was back out the door in time for the first shows at Universal."
