        "source_1": "I’m focusing just on the battery. Dual SIM on 4G, brightness around 60%, all notifications on. My daily routine is about 45 minutes of calls, 1.5 hours of WhatsApp, 2 hours of YouTube, 4–5 hours of Spotify over Bluetooth in the car, plus some photos and Maps for a quick errand. Starting at 100% at 7 a.m., I end the day around 55–60%. The next day I’m at roughly 20–25% by late evening. Overnight standby drop is 2–3%. I’ve settled into charging it every other night.",
        "source_2": "Only talking about the fingerprint reader: at my kitchen counter it’s a chore. With slightly damp hands from rinsing vegetables or a bit of flour on my thumb, it rejects me multiple times and I end up keying in the PIN. I registered the same thumb three times and still get maybe 50–60% success when my hands aren’t perfectly dry. At my desk with clean, dry fingers, it unlocks on the first try almost every time, so it’s very sensitive to any residue.",
        "source_3": "Battery under heavier use falls short for me. Commuting with 5G on, an hour of Google Maps, 2 hours of Instagram Reels, another hour of YouTube, about 30 minutes of calls, and a few photos—starting at 100% at 8 a.m., I’m down to 10–15% by 6 p.m. Auto-brightness pushes to 80% outdoors, and I see noticeable drain from the system’s background processes (Device Care/Services showing double-digit usage). I usually need a top-up around 3 p.m., so a second day isn’t realistic with this pattern.",
        "source_4": "Set this up for my dad (68). I bumped the font size, turned off gesture navigation, and moved his most-used apps to the first screen. He does WhatsApp video calls with the grandkids (30–45 minutes), watches 1–2 hours of YouTube in the evening, and listens to podcasts/music through the speaker for 3–4 hours while doing chores. He often forgets to charge, yet it still lasts him into the second evening. The side fingerprint sensor picks up his thumb as he answers calls; I don’t catch him re-trying it. Earpiece volume is strong enough for his hearing, and the phone hasn’t glitched during calls.",
        "source_5": "After a week as my mom’s daily driver: battery isn’t the problem—she finishes a day with plenty left. The snags are elsewhere. The lock screen shows promotional cards, and she keeps getting “clean-up” nudges that confuse her. The fingerprint reader is fine when she’s seated, but in the garden with a bit of moisture or soil it fails and she forgets the PIN, leading to lockouts. I ended up disabling a bunch of system suggestions and set a simpler unlock pattern. Even with those tweaks, she’s wary of touching the sensor unless her hands are spotless."
