        "source_1": "I spent three nights at the Circle Hotel in Waikiki with my partner, flying in late and checking in close to midnight. We ended up on the 9th floor with a sliver of ocean between the buildings. The place is steps from the beach and the city bus, so we just walked everywhere. The room itself felt compact but tidy—crisp sheets, no musty smell, and the AC kept a steady hum. The bathroom is tight; the door clears the toilet by an inch and the sink is the size of a salad bowl, but we were out from sunrise to sunset, so it didn’t slow us down. We already penciled it in for next spring.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the bathroom: I’m 6'2\" and couldn’t turn around without brushing the shower curtain. There’s essentially no counter space—just a pedestal sink—so my toiletry bag sat on the toilet tank and kept sliding off. Shaving meant bumping an elbow into the towel rack, and blow-drying required wedging the dryer cord around the door hinge. If you need room to get ready, this setup makes mornings a juggling act.",
        "source_3": "I stayed one night between flights and paid close attention to cleanliness. I ran a wipe across the nightstand and it came up clean, grout looked bright, and the tub didn’t have that film you sometimes see near the drain. Towels smelled neutral, not perfumey, and my white socks didn’t gray out after walking around the tile. Housekeeping swapped out our sandy beach towels within minutes when I called down.",
        "source_4": "Location-wise, this hotel makes Waikiki easy. Two minutes to Kuhio Beach, an ABC Store downstairs for sunscreen and snacks, and the trolley stop right outside. We watched Friday fireworks by walking to the end of the block, grabbed late-night ramen around the corner, and never needed a car. Morning runs along the beach path started right from the front door.",
        "source_5": "Week-long family trip with two kids, and the overall setup wore us down. The bathroom bottlenecked every morning—one tiny sink, nowhere to put toiletries, and the door hitting knees made it a dance. The closet barely fit our stroller, and street noise kept the little one up past bedtime. On day two we still found sand on the floor after housekeeping. The location saved us time, but by the end we were ready for someplace with more breathing room."
