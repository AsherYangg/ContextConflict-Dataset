        "source_1": "I handle support calls all day, and on this handset the calling has been solid for me. Over the last three weeks I’ve answered roughly 35–40 calls a day on VoLTE with Wi‑Fi calling turned off, and I haven’t seen the “call ends as soon as you pick up” issue people mention. Tried it across two cities (home and office), swapped between a Jio and Airtel SIM, and even used a Bluetooth headset (Jabra 65t) for about 10 hours of talk time; the only drop I had was in an underground parking lot with one signal bar.",
        "source_2": "Out of the box (build 1.0.1), answering a call would sometimes cut off within two seconds, which made me start logging patterns. After the 1.0.3 OTA last Friday, plus toggling off Wi‑Fi calling and clearing the dialer cache, the behavior changed completely—no abrupt endings in 60+ answered calls over five days. Before the patch I counted 14 instant disconnects in one afternoon; since then I’ve tested with speaker, earpiece, and a car’s Bluetooth (Honda Civic), and the handoff no longer trips the call.",
        "source_3": "I mostly care about battery life, and here’s how it behaves for me: with 120 Hz enabled, brightness around 70%, two SIMs active, and about 90 minutes of GPS navigation plus Spotify, I land at 15–20% by 9 p.m. Screen‑on time sits around 6–7 hours on workdays. Overnight drain is 8–10% with 5G left on, closer to 3% if I flip to LTE and airplane mode at bedtime. A 30‑minute top‑up on the 33W charger takes me from 20% to roughly 75%, which is enough to finish the day.",
        "source_4": "After three months, I’ve kept this as my daily driver. Setup was straightforward, the UI feels quick, the fingerprint reader is accurate, and app switching during Slack calls and map navigation is smooth. The camera is consistent for social posts, and the speakers are loud enough for podcasts in the kitchen. I did hit the call cut‑off once in the first week, but I couldn’t reproduce it afterward; with my usage (email, Teams, maps, two hours of calls), it’s been dependable enough to replace my older phone.",
        "source_5": "I needed this as a main work phone, and the call behavior made that hard. Twice in one day, the line dropped right as I answered, and across ten days it happened enough that clients noticed. I reset network settings, swapped SIMs, and even tried a replacement unit from the store; same pattern—clean texts and data, but incoming calls that sometimes terminate on pickup. Support asked for logs, which showed abrupt end events with no clear trigger. I eventually returned it because I couldn’t trust it for time‑sensitive conversations.",
        "source_6": "I’m all about the camera, and it’s been fun to shoot with. Portrait mode separates edges cleanly, and in daylight the colors are punchy without weird skin tones. Video at 4K 60 is stable when walking, and indoor shots at a café keep detail on menus without blowing out lights. In low light there’s some grain if you zoom, but Night mode recovers signage and storefronts well enough for Instagram. I’ve printed a few 8×10 photos from weekend trips, and they held up without muddy textures."
