        "source_1": "I filtered for “Made in USA” rawhide and clicked the Dingo 10-pack because the bullets mentioned “USA-sourced hide.” What arrived was the red-and-yellow Dingo bag with “Made in China” buried near the seam in tiny print (lot code 23091, UPC ending 1432). The chews look thinner than the photos and have a glossy coating I wasn’t expecting. I spent 20 minutes in chat with Amazon and the rep said the listing covers multiple sellers; they offered a return label but couldn’t confirm future shipments would be U.S.-made.",
        "source_2": "I bought these for my 35 lb beagle and gave half a bone every other day for a week. By day six she threw up twice and had very dark urine. Our vet ran labs and flagged elevated BUN/creatinine, then immediately asked about treats sourced from China. I checked the bag and found “Product of China” in fine print. We stopped the chews, switched to her regular diet, and two weeks later her kidney values were back in range. The pieces had a sharp chemical smell when I first opened the pouch, which I dismissed at the time—won’t do that again.",
        "source_3": "I must have gotten a different run: the 7-count mini bones I received (sold by “Dingo_USA_Store”) came with a big “Made in USA” badge printed on the front and a QC stamp on the back (lot 24112). The rawhide sheets are dense, no artificial color bleeding, and zero odor when I open the bag. My two labs split one after dinner; stools stayed normal, and the bones don’t leave greasy marks on the rug. If there’s an imported version, I didn’t get that—this batch looks domestic and well-finished.",
        "source_4": "I keep this item on Subscribe & Save for our rescue’s chew rotation. Month one came from Amazon Warehouse and looked like U.S. stock; month three switched to a third-party seller without warning, same ASIN, same photos with an American flag, but the package that showed up says “Made in China.” The product page lumps all inventory together so you can’t pick origin, and Customer Service told me they “can’t guarantee manufacturing location.” I canceled the subscription because the variability makes planning tough.",
        "source_5": "I’ve used Dingo bones on and off for years. They keep my terrier busy for 30–40 minutes, price per bone is reasonable, and Prime delivery lands them in a day. What throws me is the inconsistency: some bags are thick, clean rawhide with no smell; other times the twists are thin and dyed brighter than in the photos. I’ve learned to check the fine print near the seal for country of origin—when the U.S.-stamped ones are in stock, I add two bags; when only the imported batch is available, I pass."
