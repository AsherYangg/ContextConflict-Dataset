        "source_1": "I booked Cliff Vilas largely because the rate included breakfast, and I wanted to keep extras to a minimum. The included menu turned out to be fruit, pastries, juice, and drip coffee; anything beyond that—espresso drinks, pancakes, eggs Benedict—had a surcharge. One morning I ordered a cappuccino and two poached eggs, and the bill came to about 160k IDR on top of the “included” meal. The buffet starts at 7:30 a.m., which is late if you’re trying to catch a dawn surf; they offered a takeaway box, but it took 25 minutes to prepare and the croissants were day-old. The ocean view from the dining terrace is gorgeous, but if you’re expecting a fully covered breakfast, budget for add-ons.",
        "source_2": "We spent seven nights over Easter and it felt like living in a private residence perched over the water. The villa is huge—bedroom, living pavilion, and a bathroom that’s almost comically expansive, with double vanities and a soaking tub. The pool is long enough to do short laps, and the cabana became our afternoon hangout spot with the sea framed in every direction. Our butler arranged scooter rentals, a sunset table at a nearby cliff bar, and even ran a bath with frangipani petals as a surprise. The nightly rate was under US$600 with breakfast, and compared with other places we’ve tried in Bali, the space and views here are on another level.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on service because that was our sticking point. The assigned butler was friendly but juggling too many villas; requests kept slipping. A wake-up call never happened, we waited 45 minutes for the buggy after dinner, and housekeeping arrived close to 5 p.m. when we were trying to shower before heading out. Fresh pool towels required two follow-up calls and a WhatsApp nudge. Everyone greeted us by name and made small talk, but the pacing felt off, like there wasn’t a clear system behind the smiles.",
        "source_4": "The private pool looks dramatic with the infinity edge and cliff backdrop, but it’s not as carefree as the photos suggest. Afternoon winds off the ocean made the water chilly even in the sun, and the far corner stayed shaded most of the day. The tile near the steps was slick, so we kept our toddler in the cabana rather than risk a slip. The pool runs deep along the edge—great for plunging, less great for kids—and the pump emitted a low hum at night you could hear from the living room. I loved the idea of a “magnificent” private pool; in practice we used it in short bursts rather than lounging there for hours.",
        "source_5": "As an overall stay, Cliff Vilas delivered the postcard view, but the experience had rough edges I couldn’t ignore. Check-in took almost two hours because our villa wasn’t ready, with luggage parked in the lobby while we sipped welcome drinks and watched other guests head off to their rooms. Wi‑Fi cut out a few times during video calls, and the deck furniture gathered salt spray so your clothes picked up grit if you sat without wiping it down first. Breakfast varied day to day—omelets one morning were fluffy, another day runny—and we never quite figured out what was included versus extra charges. Staff were kind, yet tasks moved slowly, and by the end I felt I’d spent a premium night rate for a view rather than a seamless stay.",
        "source_6": "The villa’s scale is impressive, but the layout isn’t entirely practical. The bathroom occupies nearly half the footprint with a long corridor and an open-to-air section; it looks dramatic, yet at night it meant a chilly walk from the bedroom to the shower. AC zoning struggled with the tall ceilings, so the living room stayed a couple degrees warmer than the bedroom even with fans on. Light switches aren’t labeled, and it took a few days to learn which panel controlled the garden, which for the pool, and which dimmed the vanity. You do get a sweeping ocean line from every room, but there were moments when I wished for a cozier design rather than grand scale."
