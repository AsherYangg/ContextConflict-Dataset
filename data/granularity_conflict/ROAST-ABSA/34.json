        "source_1": "I enrolled for three months and the monthly fee fit within my student budget. After the trial, I used a promo they emailed me and paused the subscription during finals week without losing progress. Compared to a $120 campus textbook and separate cloud credits, this bundled setup ended up costing me less. Billing reminders arrived a few days before renewal, so I could plan around pay periods.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the platform only: the hosted lab kept timing out, and twice the VM froze during a training run, which wiped a few unsaved cells. The GPU queue regularly sat at 10–15 minutes, and the autograder bounced my notebook because it expected a slightly different library version than the one in the template. I started exporting notebooks to Colab just to get assignments turned in before the deadline.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, the program gave me enough structure to go from spreadsheets to a working image classifier in about four weeks. The guided notebooks and inline checks kept me moving, and I didn’t spend evenings wrestling with CUDA installs. By the end, I put together a small churn model for my team at work and presented a baseline with clear steps to improve it. For a two-month push, it delivered the momentum I needed.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on instruction quality: lectures felt like slide readings, and when I asked about regularization trade-offs, I got a link to a vendor blog instead of a walkthrough of the math. Office hours landed at 1 a.m. in my time zone, and forum replies often arrived days later. Examples leaned on prewritten helper functions, which made it tough to see the mechanics behind each step.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression after finishing two courses: I tried to rebuild the projects locally with scikit-learn and PyTorch, and a lot of the code depended on proprietary wrappers and datasets behind course links. Once my access ended, the notebooks broke, and I had to replace half the pipeline to run it on my machine. That’s when I realized I’d learned the workflow for that ecosystem rather than a transferable setup.",
        "source_6": "Narrowing to the platform workflow: spinning up the workspace took under a minute, the environment matched the versions in the videos, and datasets were already staged. Autosave caught my edits between devices, and the grader pointed to the exact cell where my output diverged. I didn’t install anything locally, which kept my laptop clean and my focus on the modeling steps."
