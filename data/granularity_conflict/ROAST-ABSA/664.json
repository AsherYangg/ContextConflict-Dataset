        "source_1": "As soon as I powered it on, the phone locked up during the Google sign‑in screen; got “System UI isn’t responding” twice. HiOS threw an “app keeps stopping” prompt while toggling Wi‑Fi. The RAM meter showed 61% used right after setup, before installing anything. Scrolling through Facebook felt choppy even with “Auto refresh rate” enabled, and turning on Memory Extension (set to 3 GB) made no perceptible difference opening recent apps. My unit arrived with the display unwrapped inside the box; there was only a thin foam sheet, and I noticed two hairline scuffs near the earpiece.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about motion smoothness, and this panel behaves better than I expected. Developer options shows it switching to 120 Hz in the launcher and Chrome, and Twitter scrolls without the micro‑judder I see on some 60 Hz phones. Games like Call of Duty run at a steady 60 with frame pacing that feels consistent; the only drop I saw was when battery saver kicked in, which is normal. If your priority is fluid scrolling, this screen gets the job done day to day.",
        "source_3": "I tested the Memory Extension feature by enabling the extra 5 GB and then opening 12 apps in sequence (YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Photos, two games, and a couple of social apps). Before enabling it, Instagram and Chrome kept reloading tabs when I returned; after enabling, I could hop back to a 20‑tab Chrome session and a paused game without a reload. The RAM chart in Dev Options hovered around 70% but multitasking felt steadier, so the feature isn’t just a toggle with no effect.",
        "source_4": "Mine was shipped with the screen covered by a factory film plus an extra peel‑off protector, both intact inside a snug cardboard cradle. The phone sat between two thick foam slabs, and the accessory box was taped so nothing rattled. I checked the glass under bright light right out of the box and didn’t find any scuffs or swirl marks; whatever they’re doing with packing at the warehouse worked in my case.",
        "source_5": "Setup took about 15 minutes, and I didn’t hit any freezes while restoring from my old phone. HiOS prompted two OTA updates right away; after installing them, gestures and app switching felt responsive. Idle memory sat around 45% with only system apps, and with my daily mix (WhatsApp, banking, Maps, camera) it stayed under 65%. Auto refresh rate kept the UI snappy, and I didn’t need to touch the Memory Extension. The device arrived clean with the front film on and no cosmetic issues. My only nitpick was the amount of preloaded apps I had to uninstall."
