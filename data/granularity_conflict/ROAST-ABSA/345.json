        "source_1": "I judge flavored coffee almost entirely by aroma. When I cracked the seal, there was a brief pop of blueberry, but after grinding medium-fine for a V60, the fragrance dropped off hard. During the pour, my kitchen stayed mostly neutral, and even with my nose right over the mug, the berry note faded by the third sip. I can’t speak to the taste details—I’m chasing a brew that perfumes the room, and this one doesn’t stick around.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on flavor intensity: I brewed on a Bonavita drip at a 1:16 ratio with filtered water at 200°F. The cup leaned roast-forward with only a whisper of fruit. I tried again at 195°F and bumped the dose to 1:14; stronger extraction, but the blueberry still came across thin with a slightly drying finish. A splash of cream and a teaspoon of sugar didn’t coax more berry out of it.",
        "source_3": "Big-picture take after a week of breakfasts: it’s become our weekend crowd pot. I do a 12-cup carafe on a Cuisinart, medium grind, and it goes fast. My partner, who usually avoids anything berry-flavored, polished off two mugs without sweetener. With half-and-half, the berry rides on top of the roast instead of turning candy-like. This is the bag I set out when we have neighbors over.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression across two bags: it hits the two things I’m after—there’s a clear blueberry scent when it brews and a distinct note in the cup—but I still keep an eye out for an even more dialed-in version. It’s solid enough that I’d serve it to guests, yet I get the sense a richer, more aromatic take is somewhere out there, so I haven’t stopped sampling other options.",
        "source_5": "Single-aspect note on iced prep: as a cold brew (1:8 ratio, 18 hours in the fridge, coarse grind), the berry character all but vanishes, leaving something that tastes like plain medium roast over ice. Hot, the kitchen smells fruity; poured over ice, the aroma disappears, and I end up adding a splash of blueberry syrup to get the cup to match the bag’s promise."
