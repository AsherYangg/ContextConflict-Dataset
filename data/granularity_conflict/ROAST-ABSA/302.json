        "source_1": "I finished the four-week Graphic Design Specialization starter and, as an overall take, it set me up well for the later courses. The structure felt logical: Week 1 on visual hierarchy and Gestalt, Week 2 on grids, Week 3 on typography basics, and Week 4 tying it all together with a brand mark project. The instructor’s breakdowns of grid columns and rhythm made my first magazine spread look far less chaotic than anything I’d tried before, and the weekly reflections nudged me to connect the exercises to my own portfolio. By the end, I could explain why a layout worked instead of just guessing.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on how clearly ideas are explained: I kept rewinding the lectures on negative space and composition because steps were skipped. In the poster demo, he jumped from a rough sketch to a polished layout with several edits happening off-screen, and terms like kerning and leading were used before they were defined in that week. The logo assignment expected comfort with the Pathfinder tool in Illustrator, but there wasn’t a full walk-through, so I had to hunt for external videos to replicate what he was doing.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about the instructor’s enthusiasm: his eyes light up when he talks about Bauhaus posters, and he peppers the lectures with stories from real client critiques. In the color theory segment, he pulls out vintage print samples and compares ink behavior under different papers, which made a dry topic feel like show-and-tell. Even the forum posts late at night had animated, emoji-laden replies where he nudged us to push an idea one iteration further.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the course felt more like a sampler platter than a meal. The assignments (like making 12 thumbnail compositions with basic shapes) never stretched beyond fundamentals, and by the time typography started to get interesting, the four weeks were over. Peer grading was a mixed bag—lots of “looks good” with little rationale—so I didn’t walk away with the kind of critique that changes how you design. I was hoping for one substantial project that carried through the entire course with deeper feedback.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on assignment instructions and evaluation: the briefs were crystal clear. Each project had a checklist (deliverables, file types, naming conventions), sample outputs with annotations, and a rubric that mapped directly to Gestalt principles and hierarchy. For the brand mark exercise, the rubric spelled out alignment, contrast, and reduction tests, so I knew exactly why I earned each point. Deadlines and required discussion posts were flagged in multiple places, which made planning my week straightforward.",
        "source_6": "Only on the instructor’s delivery energy: the lecture tone stayed flat for long stretches, and he rarely looked into the camera. In several videos he read directly from the slides, which were text-heavy, and the pacing felt metronomic. When he introduced the grid system, the explanations came across like a manual, without the spark that would pull you into experimenting beyond the examples."
