        "source_1": "I flew in on a red-eye and was checked in within minutes; they had a corner one-bedroom on the 42nd floor ready, with the harbor stretching out from both the living room and the bathtub window. The team at the lounge set me up with a quiet table to finish a presentation, and the chef made an omelet exactly to order while another staffer pressed my suit in under an hour. At night I sat by the floor-to-ceiling glass and watched the Symphony of Lights with a pot of jasmine tea from turndown, then slept like a rock thanks to blackout curtains and a mattress that felt brand new.",
        "source_2": "I’m leaving this just about service timing. My wake-up call for a 6:15 a.m. flight never came; I caught it because I set a phone alarm. Room service quoted 20 minutes for a simple congee and coffee at 5 a.m., but the tray arrived at 5:35 and the coffee was tepid. My suitcase took 40 minutes to reach the room after check-in, and I had to call housekeeping twice for the extra pillows I’d requested in the app. Everyone I spoke with was polite, but the delays stacked up and threw off my schedule.",
        "source_3": "I booked purely for the view and wasn’t disappointed. From the sofa you can track ferries gliding between Kowloon and Central, and sunrise paints the water a copper pink that’s easy to photograph through spotless glass. I pulled the blackout shades at midday to cut glare for a Zoom call, then opened them again at eight to watch the harbor light show. If you’re into cityscapes, request a higher floor on the harbor side and plan to spend at least one evening just sitting by the window.",
        "source_4": "As an overall stay, the place felt more hectic than I expected. The lobby buzzed like a mall atrium, with a line snaking to the front desk at 3 p.m. and music bouncing off the marble. The lounge was packed at afternoon tea; I circled twice before finding a seat near the door, and staff were clearing plates as soon as you set down a fork. My suite looked sleek, but the sliding bedroom door didn’t close flush and the AC had a low hum that was noticeable at night. Being attached to IFC is handy, though the taxi drop-off gets jammed at peak hours, and the room felt tighter than the square footage suggested.",
        "source_5": "I’m focusing on design and features. The palette skews beige and grey with sharp-edged furniture; the coffee table caught my shin more than once. Lighting is controlled via a tablet that lagged, so simple tasks—dim the bedside lamp, turn off the desk light—took multiple taps. The elevator banks are split and not clearly labeled; I ended up riding to the wrong tower twice. The bathroom marble looks refined but gets slick when damp, and the rain shower had a gentle spray rather than a drenching flow. There’s a strong signature scent in the lobby that lingered on my jacket after a short wait."
