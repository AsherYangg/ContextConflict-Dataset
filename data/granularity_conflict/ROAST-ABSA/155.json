        "source_1": "Stayed three nights in mid-July and drew a top-floor room (508) tucked under the eaves. With no air unit, heat pooled up there and the small window only tilted open a crack, so nights felt stuffy even with the desk fan going. The room itself was narrow—once my suitcase was open, there wasn’t much floor left—and the bed had noticeable sink when I sat on the edge. Breakfast at 7:30 was mostly sliced bread, jam, and a push-button coffee machine; I didn’t spot pastries or hot items those days. What it does have going for it is the spot: I could step onto Dam Square in half a minute, and the tram stop on the square (lines 4 and 14) made getting to Museumplein simple.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the breakfast because I had early meetings: both mornings (around 8:15) there were warm croissants coming out on a tray and a platter of mini pancakes next to a syrup jug. They also had a dispenser with a choice of orange or apple juice, plus pitchers of water with lemon slices. Yogurt, muesli, and a bowl of chopped fruit (melon, pineapple) were available, and a staff member refilled the croissants while I was there. Coffee was from a bean-to-cup machine and didn’t taste burnt. I left full without touching the bread.",
        "source_3": "My stay was one night in room 204 facing the inner courtyard. I care a lot about mattresses—soft ones give me back twinges—and this one felt supportive. No roll-toward-the-middle effect, and I slept through until my alarm. They provided two pillow types (one flatter, one thicker) and the fitted sheet stayed tight. For reference, I’m about 85 kg and usually notice sag if it’s there.",
        "source_4": "Service stood out to me. I arrived at 10:45 a.m. expecting to drop bags, and the receptionist, Sara, tagged and stored them, then texted me at 1:02 p.m. when a room freed up. That evening my key card stopped working; she re-encoded it immediately and handed me a spare without fuss. Next morning I asked for a boarding pass printout—done in under a minute. Housekeeping said hello in the hall and offered fresh towels without me asking.",
        "source_5": "Location is a double-edged sword. Being right on Dam Square meant I could join a walking tour in under five minutes and hop on tram 14 with no detour. But the square stays lively late: street musicians and the clock chimes kept going until close to midnight on Friday, and crowd noise filtered up even with the window shut. Earplugs helped, but if you’re after a quiet night, this area might be a trade-off.",
        "source_6": "I’m particular about interiors, and I actually liked the vibe here. The lobby had clean lines with black metal lamps and a few succulents, plus a playful neon sign over the seating nook. Hallways showed vintage Amsterdam travel posters, and my floor had a herringbone-look vinyl that felt deliberate rather than bare. Not luxury by any means, but it didn’t feel thrown together; I snapped a couple of photos because it looked tidy and intentional."
