        "source_1": "I’ve been using the REDMI K50i 5G for a little over two weeks and it’s been a dependable daily driver. The processor feels quick in day-to-day use—jumping between Maps, WhatsApp, and Chrome is smooth, and the various sensors (proximity, gyro) behave reliably during calls and games. The 144 Hz screen makes scrolling look fluid; even though it isn’t AMOLED, outdoor visibility is fine after bumping brightness and switching the color profile to Standard. The main camera handles casual shots well; in the evening I switch to Night mode to keep blur in check. Battery typically lasts me from morning to late evening with heavy messaging and music streaming, and the included charger takes it from around 15% to full in roughly half an hour.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery and charging: with two SIMs on 5G, Bluetooth earbuds, and about an hour of gaming on my commute, I’m getting at most 5–6 hours of screen-on time. Standby drain overnight is 8–10% even with most apps restricted. Charging from 10% to 100% takes closer to 45–50 minutes for me, and the phone gets noticeably warm for the first half of the session. The last 10% also seems to drop quicker than expected during maps navigation.",
        "source_3": "Just to talk about the display: I came from an AMOLED device and was worried about the switch, but the 144 Hz panel here won me over for day-to-day use. Motion is exceptionally smooth in Twitter, Reddit, and long web pages. Colors look natural after setting the color temperature a bit warmer, and text rendering is crisp. I don’t see any distracting glow or bleed on a dark background, and watching YouTube at 1080p looks clean with stable brightness.",
        "source_4": "My experience focuses on the screen only, and I do miss AMOLED. In dim rooms, the blacks look more like dark gray and there’s visible IPS glow from the corners on a black image. Auto-brightness steps are a bit jumpy going from indoors to outdoors and I often end up adjusting it manually. Also, the adaptive refresh rate sometimes drops when scrolling long articles, which makes the motion look uneven compared to a locked high-refresh panel.",
        "source_5": "I mainly care about the camera. After the recent update, Night mode has been surprisingly dependable—street scenes under yellow lamps come out detailed without blowing out signboards, and handheld shots don’t smear unless I move a lot. Daytime images, however, can push blues too far and occasionally clip bright clouds. Video autofocus is steady for walking clips, but it hunts a bit when switching between near and far subjects.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on performance: the first few days felt snappy, but once I loaded Slack, Teams, and Instagram, I started noticing small hiccups—keyboard pop-ups lag behind in some apps and opening the camera from the lock screen stutters. In Genshin Impact at 60 fps, it starts smooth and then drops to the mid-40s after 15 minutes, with the back panel warming near the camera module. The system also tends to reload background apps more aggressively than I expected when I jump back after a few minutes."
