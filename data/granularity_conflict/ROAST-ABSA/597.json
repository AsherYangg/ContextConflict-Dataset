        "source_1": "I track my sodium because my daily target is 1,500 mg, so I measured exactly half a cup and compared it to the label. At 860 mg per serving, it ate up more than half my allotment before I’d even salted anything else that day. On the palate it read like brine—after the first spoonful I diluted it with unsalted beans and still found it dominating the dish. Rinsing helped a little, but the texture and flavor seemed built around a heavy salt load. If someone watches their intake, this requires careful portioning or a lot of counterbalancing with low-sodium ingredients.",
        "source_2": "One of the cans from my recent four-pack arrived with a slightly domed bottom and a sticky residue around the seam. When I tapped the lid it hissed, and opening it sent a spray onto the counter with a sour, metallic smell. The code on the base read “BestBy 04/2013, 1140 C3 342 12.” I double-bagged it and tossed it, wiped down the cupboard with bleach, and took photos for the support team. The other three cans were flat and quiet, but that single one convinced me to check for any swelling or deformation before storing.",
        "source_3": "I’ve bought this product on and off over the past year and keep a couple of cans for quick weeknight chili. None of mine have bulged or leaked, and the seams look tidy with clear date stamps. It’s assertive right out of the can, so I stretch it with tomatoes and unsalted broth; the kids don’t comment on it being too intense when it’s part of a pot. Batch codes on recent cans read “BestBy 10/2024.” I store them in a cool pantry and haven’t seen odd smells or textures. For me the draw is the convenience—open, simmer, and dinner lands on the table fast.",
        "source_4": "I had a can pop in the pantry—found the lid slightly lifted and a spray pattern on the shelf like someone shook a soda. This was late August with the room around 80°F. The contents were sticky and the odor wasn’t right, more sharp than usual. The base stamp said “BestBy 02/2013, 1217 B2.” I used gloves to clean, tossed anything that looked splattered, and moved the remaining cans to a lower shelf away from heat. I now check for dings or bulges when unloading groceries and won’t open anything that feels pressurized.",
        "source_5": "I keep a few cans as part of my emergency stash and rotate them into stews. The sodium on the label is high, so I portion at a quarter cup per person and build the rest of the flavor with herbs and low-sodium broth. Texture holds up well in a simmer and the contents don’t break down into mush. I’ve never had a can arrive deformed; the last order had “BestBy 08/2025” stamped cleanly, and the lids sat perfectly flat. Stored in an air-conditioned pantry, they’ve stayed stable and easy to work with on busy nights.",
        "source_6": "Focusing purely on taste: the salinity overshadowed everything else in a simple soup. I tried it as a base with carrots and potatoes, but the broth turned out like seawater even before adding any extra seasoning. A friend suggested tossing in peeled potatoes to absorb some of it, which muted it slightly but also thinned the overall flavor. In a pasta sauce, the saltiness pushed past the tomatoes and garlic and made it tricky to balance without diluting it to the point of losing body. It seems formulated for recipes that expect heavy dilution."
