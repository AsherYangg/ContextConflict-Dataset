        "source_1": "I spent a week at the Resortquest Pacific Monarch in early July and used it mostly as a crash pad between beach time and day trips. I booked a high-floor studio (room 2907). Check-in took about five minutes; the front desk handed me beach towels and pointed out the rooftop pool hours. The kitchenette had a two-burner cooktop, microwave, and full-size fridge, so I made eggs and coffee and ate on the lanai most mornings. From the balcony I could see a thin slice of ocean between buildings. Walking to Kuhio Beach took me around 6–7 minutes, and I grabbed poke from the ABC Store downstairs more than once. The bus stop on Kuhio Ave made it easy to get to Pearl Harbor and back. Housekeeping swapped out towels when I asked and left extra coffee packets. For the price I paid through a package deal, it fit what I needed from a simple base in Waikiki.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on cleanliness. In room 1602, the shower grout had black spots, and the bathroom exhaust vent was covered in dust. The tile floor near the kitchenette felt sticky even after I wiped it with a damp towel, and I found long hairs on the bedspread when I pulled it back. The AC filter looked grayed over, like it hadn’t been rinsed in a while, and the room had a damp smell that lingered even with the lanai door open. Housekeeping brought me fresh sheets on request, but the musty odor and the grout issue didn’t get addressed during my three-night stay.",
        "source_3": "My experience was dominated by how requests were handled. I arrived at 2:30 pm and was told the room would be ready “soon,” but I didn’t get keys until 4:15. Calling down for an extra blanket took three tries; the phone rang unanswered twice, and when I got through I was told someone would bring it within the hour. It finally showed up after midnight, after I had already nodded off. The next day our room wasn’t serviced; when I asked at the desk, I was told we were “on the list,” with no estimate. The bellman did take a minute to point out a shortcut to the bus stop, but overall it felt like guest requests weren’t a priority.",
        "source_4": "Focusing just on location: it’s not on the sand, and with a stroller plus beach gear it took us 12–15 minutes to reach the water because of crosswalks at Kuhio and Kalakaua. Coming back is slightly uphill, which felt longer in the afternoon heat. Street noise carried up to our 21st-floor unit, and garbage trucks started clanging around 5:30 am on weekdays. Our “ocean view” was mostly rooftops with a thin strip of blue between taller towers.",
        "source_5": "Strictly about cost: the nightly rate looked appealing, but the add-ons piled up—there was a daily facility fee, taxes, and parking at $40 per day in a nearby garage. The coin laundry ran $3.50 to wash and $3.50 to dry. Over five nights, the total landed several hundred higher than my base quote. After the trip I compared and found a couple of condo-style places near Ala Moana with parking included and no facility fee. If you’re watching your budget, factor those extras in.",
        "source_6": "After six nights at the Resortquest Pacific Monarch, I’d choose a different place next time. The building shows its age—scuffed hallways, an elevator that occasionally overshot the floor and reopened, and a rooftop pool that felt maxed out once four or five people showed up. Our studio’s kitchenette worked in a pinch, but the coffee maker leaked and the pans were warped. Between street noise and the window AC cycling on and off, falling asleep before midnight was tough. The bus access was convenient, but the daily back-and-forth to the beach with kids got old. With the surprise fees on top of the rate and the general wear, the stay felt more like managing problems than relaxing."
