        "source_1": "I bought this mostly for the camera and spent a weekend testing it. In daylight, faces come out detailed and colors land close to what I see, and the HDR doesn’t blow out the sky. Indoors, though, the focus sometimes hunts before locking, and a moving kid ends up with a bit of blur unless I tap to focus first. Night mode brightens the scene but smooths textures on walls and skin. Video at 1080p looks steady when I’m walking, but quick pans show a little wobble. It’s solid for quick snaps, yet there’s room for tuning, especially in low light and autofocus.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the screen: after switching the refresh to the higher setting in Display > Motion options, scrolling through Chrome and Twitter feels silky and the text on long articles looks razor-clean. The panel gets bright enough to read under mid-day sun, and the color temperature slider helped me dial out the cool tint it shipped with. Watching 4K YouTube clips, edges stay crisp and there’s no grain in dark scenes. Off-axis, I can see a faint shift in whites, but head-on it’s all punch and clarity.",
        "source_3": "I’m surprisingly into the breathing light around the camera. I set different patterns for calls and Telegram, and a slow pulse for charging so I can tell it’s topped up from across the room. The brightness slider lets me keep it subtle during the day, and I scheduled it to stay off while I’m asleep. When the phone is face down on my desk, it’s actually handy—no need to flip it just to check if that buzz was a message or an email.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take after a week, the phone feels very light in a way that makes the frame seem a bit hollow, and I can press near the SIM tray and feel a slight creak. The display looks fine on paper, but in real use Instagram stories and Maps stutter here and there, like the refresh isn’t being applied consistently. The camera handles sunny shots, yet indoors it tends to soften details and push skin tones a little pale. The ring light is flashy at first, but even at the lowest brightness it lights up my nightstand, and I couldn’t assign patterns for a couple of the apps I care about, so I ended up turning it off.",
        "source_5": "Using it as my daily driver, the build sits nicely in the hand and the low weight makes long calls easier on my wrist. The display shows crisp text and smooth animations when I’m flipping between WhatsApp, Gmail, and YouTube, and I notice fewer jitters compared with my older phone. The camera is reliable for outdoor snaps of my dog and street scenes; in restaurants I sometimes need a second try for focus, but the end results are perfectly shareable. I set the breathing light to pulse only for calls and charging, and it’s been useful for spotting the phone on a cluttered desk without picking it up."
