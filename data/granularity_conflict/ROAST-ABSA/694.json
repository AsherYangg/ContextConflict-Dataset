        "source_1": "I signed up for the Image Processing course expecting to skim, but I ended up printing the lecture notes because the derivations were laid out step by step. The module on convolution and Fourier transforms used clear diagrams that finally made the intuition click for me, and the examples jumped between satellite imagery and medical scans in a way that felt grounded. I bookmarked the PDF on histogram equalization and rewatched that video twice; the notation was consistent enough that I could follow without pausing every minute. I mostly lived in the slides and readings and barely touched the quizzes.",
        "source_2": "Week after week I looked for a coding lab and kept finding only multiple-choice quizzes. The “assignment” links were discussion prompts without starter code, datasets, or any kind of rubric. I set up a Colab notebook with OpenCV and tried to implement thresholding and edge detection on my own, but there was no way to check whether I was on the right track beyond forum replies. A graded notebook with test cases or even a simple autograder would have made a huge difference; as it stood, I never got feedback on whether my filters were performing as intended.",
        "source_3": "I took the entire session while juggling work and family, and the pacing actually worked for me: short videos, quick checkpoints, and a neat progression from sampling theory to spatial filtering. I could finish a module during my commute, and the weekly cadence kept me moving. By the third week I could explain PSNR to my team without pulling notes, and the quizzes helped me stay honest about what I remembered. I use MATLAB at work, so I didn’t feel the need for extra coding practice here; the structure fit my schedule.",
        "source_4": "The volume of material caught me off guard. There were twelve weeks with what felt like 30–40 slides each, plus long reading lists and multiple external references per topic. Videos often rephrased the same definitions, and I found myself skipping sections just to keep up. A condensed set of summaries or fewer, tighter modules would have helped; it sometimes felt like wading through more content than I could realistically absorb in a week.",
        "source_5": "I came in wanting to get my hands dirty with code. Instead, the quizzes asked me to recall terms like “Gaussian kernel” and “box filter,” and I never once submitted a program or saw a graded result. By week two I pivoted to Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course, where I implemented logistic regression and saw automated feedback on each step. Back on the image processing class, most forum threads revolved around definitions rather than building filters and measuring performance. The lectures were fine, but without labs I struggled to connect the theory to actual images.",
        "source_6": "The slide decks weren’t as polished as I expected: I spotted “correaltion” spelled that way twice, and the notation jumped between f(x, y) and g(x, y) with no explanation. Several figures were low-resolution to the point where axis labels were unreadable, and the audio in the Fourier transform video clipped in a few spots. I paused frequently to cross-check with a textbook and Wikipedia because small inconsistencies made it hard to trust that I was copying formulas correctly."
