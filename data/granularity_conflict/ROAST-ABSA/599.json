        "source_1": "I booked the Europa for our family meet-up after reading about it on TripAdvisor. Walking in through the street-level lobby felt like stepping into a plain office corridor, but once upstairs we met Gassim and his daughter, who seemed to know exactly when to check in on us and when to let us be. My room at the back looked onto a quiet courtyard; the parquet floor and upholstered headboard gave it a polished, old-world feel. We could be at the Duomo in under three minutes—morning cappuccinos at the corner bar, then straight to the cathedral before the crowds. Over five nights, our little group moved in and out with ease and ended up treating the lounge as our living room.",
        "source_2": "Location-only: I chose this hotel purely for proximity, and it delivered on that front. Each day I walked two blocks past the gelato shop and was at the Duomo almost before my phone finished loading the map. The bus stop for the airport shuttle sits around the corner, and there’s a grocery on the same street for water and snacks. The only trade-off: by 10 pm the lanes around the cathedral were packed, and the stretch outside the entrance had a steady flow of late-night foot traffic, so returning after dinner felt busy rather than secluded.",
        "source_3": "Service-only: I interacted mainly with Gassim and Miriam. They had my name ready at check-in, arranged a taxi to the airport without fuss, and slipped extra coffee pods into my bag when I mentioned early departures. On two evenings, I couldn’t reach anyone after 9:30 pm and the night porter didn’t know how to change my airport pick-up time; I ended up phoning the taxi company myself. Their style is very unobtrusive—great for privacy, but when I needed a quick answer late at night, I wished there was a more visible desk presence.",
        "source_4": "Rooms-only (comfort/design): I stayed in a back-facing room on the second floor. Double-glazed windows shut out the street chatter, and the blackout curtains actually reached the sill, so sunrise didn’t wake me. The bed leaned firm rather than squashy; good support after long days walking. Furnishings were more elegant than typical chain decor—carved wooden wardrobe, brass lamp switches, patterned fabric on the chair. The only quirk was an older wall unit that hummed when set to high, so I kept it on low and slept fine.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression: I was here with a group of 12 for a week, and the hotel won on convenience—we could split up for sightseeing and still meet at the Duomo in minutes. The entrance level gives modest first impressions, and the staircase is narrow, so getting luggage up took coordination. Breakfast seating is limited; when our whole group tried to eat together, we had to rotate in shifts. The hosts helped us reserve a nearby trattoria for a birthday, which was a nice touch. My friend’s front room faced the street and picked up late-night chatter, while my back room was hushed, so room placement mattered for sleep."
