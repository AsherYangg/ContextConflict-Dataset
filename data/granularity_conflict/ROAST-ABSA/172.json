        "source_1": "I moved over from a OnePlus after years on Android, and the iPhone felt familiar in some places and unfamiliar in others. Replying to texts from the notification works, but I can’t find a way to clear them as read without opening the thread. I rely on recorded phone interviews for work, and there’s nothing built in, so I’m juggling third‑party workarounds. Truecaller labels a few unknown numbers but doesn’t intercept them the way I was used to, so spam still slips through unless I use Apple’s “Silence Unknown Callers.” Casting to my Samsung TV (Miracast) didn’t cooperate, but AirPlay to an Apple TV box worked immediately. The dual line setup is one physical SIM and one eSIM, which took a minute to understand but functions fine now. On the upside, the camera outputs clean, steady footage, the speakers are crisp for podcasts, and my apps update quietly without the constant nudges I used to see.",
        "source_2": "Strictly about call recording: I handle phone orders and sometimes need a record of what was agreed. On my previous Android, the dialer had a big “record” button. On iPhone there’s no native option. I tried TapeACall and similar services that create a three‑way call; it works, but there’s a delay while merging lines, and customers occasionally hang up during the extra step. Voice Memos on speaker is acceptable in a quiet room but unusable in the car. Google Voice records only incoming calls and announces the recording, which doesn’t fit all situations. After a few weeks, I stopped relying on the phone for recordings and moved those calls to a desk line.",
        "source_3": "Focus on spam control/Truecaller: Out of the box, unknown callers flooded me. I enabled Settings > Phone > Call Blocking & Identification and turned on Truecaller’s toggles, then also switched on Silence Unknown Callers. After that, Truecaller began tagging many numbers on the incoming screen and in the call log. It doesn’t hard‑block the way it did on my old Xiaomi, but I’d say most obvious spam is labeled, and the silence option keeps the phone from buzzing every few minutes. It’s not as hands‑off as Android—occasionally a spam call still rings through, and Truecaller’s live caller ID seems hit‑or‑miss—but with those settings in place I’m not getting hammered all day.",
        "source_4": "Casting/mirroring only: My LG TV supports AirPlay 2, and screen mirroring from Control Center connects in seconds with smooth video for photos, presentations, and Apple TV+. Game mirroring shows a bit of latency, but for streaming and slides it’s fine. On a Windows laptop, I installed AirServer and the phone treats it like an AirPlay target; QuickTime on my MacBook also accepts a wired mirror via Lightning/USB‑C. What doesn’t work is Miracast—my older Hisense TV expects that, so the iPhone can’t see it. For that set I use the YouTube app’s cast button or a Chromecast app as a bridge. So, AirPlay gear is plug‑and‑play, Miracast isn’t, and Chromecast is app‑by‑app.",
        "source_5": "Camera only: I take family photos and short reels for my bakery. The phone locks focus fast, and low‑light shots of the display case keep detail without turning everything into mush. Macro mode handled close‑ups of piping tips and textures nicely. Cinematic Mode gave me that shallow‑focus look for Instagram, and Photographic Styles let me set a warmer tone that matches our brand. Stabilization is strong enough that I walk through the shop hand‑held and the footage is still usable. I haven’t dug into ProRAW beyond a few edits in Lightroom, but even the default HEIF files push well without banding. I ended up taking more behind‑the‑scenes videos simply because I don’t have to retry as much.",
        "source_6": "Dual SIM/eSIM only: I run a personal line and a work line. My carrier issued a QR code, and activating the eSIM took about two minutes, after which the phone showed two signal bars. Calls and texts are labeled by line, and I can set defaults per contact. There’s no second SIM tray, but I swapped my India travel plan in and out as an eSIM with no trip to a store. Two quirks: during setup iMessage initially attached to the wrong number until I toggled it off/on for the line I wanted, and WhatsApp needed a re‑verify when I moved the work number to eSIM. Aside from that, switching the active data line is quick from the status bar, and both lines stay reachable."
