        "source_1": "I arrived around 12:30 a.m. and went straight to the bed because I had an early meeting. I pulled the blanket and sheets back all the way to the foot of the mattress, checked under the bedside lamp and then under the bathroom light for any marks, and didn’t find a thing. The blanket smelled like it had just come out of a wash, corners still crisp. I even asked housekeeping to swap it anyway, and they brought a fresh duvet within ten minutes that looked just as spotless.",
        "source_2": "Stayed in 214 beside the elevator, and the walls might as well have been paper. I could make out full conversations in the hallway, the ice machine cycling every few minutes, and footsteps from above until about 1:30 a.m. Earplugs dulled it but didn’t stop the bass from a TV next door. Around 2 a.m. a group returned and laughed their way down the corridor. I finally dozed off close to 4.",
        "source_3": "Road-trip stop with two kids and a dog. Check-in took maybe three minutes, and we got a ground-floor room near the exit, which made late-night potty breaks easy. The bed felt supportive, AC ran at a steady low hum, and the kids didn’t stir once. Didn’t notice any hallway chatter from our spot, and we rolled out at 7 a.m. after a quick grab-and-go breakfast.",
        "source_4": "Came for a wedding weekend and struggled to rest. The first blanket had faint brown circles near the edge; asked for a replacement, got another with grayish streaks; the third had a small tear near the corner tag. By midnight I could hear the neighbor’s TV, and at 5 a.m. the housekeeping carts started knocking against the wall outside. I tried layering a sheet over the blanket and running the shower to drown out the noise, but it didn’t make much difference.",
        "source_5": "Booked a corner king on the top floor specifically to avoid noise. Turned off the AC and listened around midnight—only a low street murmur, nothing from adjacent rooms. No elevator rumble, no pipe sounds when neighbors showered. I’m a light sleeper and still made it through the night without waking."
