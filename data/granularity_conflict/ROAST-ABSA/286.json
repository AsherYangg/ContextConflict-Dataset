        "source_1": "I finished the course over two weekends, watching the 3–6 minute videos during my morning coffee and then practicing the ideas in the afternoon. The structure is straightforward: short lessons, a quick quiz, and an optional reading list with links. Dr. Barbara Oakley’s stories about learning engineering later in life gave me context for habits like spaced repetition, and the downloadable summaries made it easy to review before bed. I set up a simple routine—four 25/5 cycles before lunch—and the weekly checkpoints kept me on track without feeling rushed.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor: Dr. Oakley’s delivery didn’t land for me. The pace jumps around, with frequent cuts that make it feel like lines are being read rather than explained, and I often dropped the playback speed to 0.75 to follow the transitions. The microphone peaks at times, and the mix with the background music made me rewind several segments just to catch a definition. I would have preferred more on-screen notation and fewer anecdotes; the performance style kept pulling me out of the material.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the Pomodoro segment: I took the 25/5 approach literally and used a $9 kitchen timer, tracking four rounds on a sticky note. The tip about shutting down tabs and physically stepping away during breaks finally stopped my “just one more email” habit. Pairing the timer with a quick “cue–routine–reward” checklist (mine was: start timer, single task, mark a box, 5-minute stretch) made it stick. After a week, I moved to 40/10 for deep reading, and the technique still held up.",
        "source_4": "Speaking to the course as a whole: after completing weeks 1 and 2, the content felt like ideas I’ve already seen summarized across blogs and videos, just organized into a syllabus. Quizzes leaned heavily on recall (“select all that apply”) and didn’t ask me to apply the concepts to a case or plan. The discussion forum was quiet—my thread on managing shift-work study blocks went unanswered for days—and the assignments didn’t push beyond multiple choice. I paused at that point because I wanted more depth on the research behind the recommendations.",
        "source_5": "Narrowly about accessibility and materials: the English captions on several videos lagged by about two seconds, and proper names (like “Zeigarnik”) were transcribed inconsistently, which made note-taking messy. On mobile, the transcript PDF for week 3 had two missing images, so the reference to the “chunking diagram” didn’t match what I saw. I had to watch on desktop to keep captions and visuals aligned, and even then I was replaying sections to catch the exact phrasing."
