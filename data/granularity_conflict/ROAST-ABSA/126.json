        "source_1": "I finished the course over two weekends. The sequence made sense: foundations, linear/logistic regression, regularization, trees, and model comparison. Prof. Scott’s examples—predicting movie ratings and hospital readmissions—were explained with step-by-step algebra and short Python demos. The weekly wrap-up slides and mini-quizzes kept me on track, and I used the cross-validation section to clean up a churn model at work. For an intro, it hit the breadth I wanted without drowning me in proofs.",
        "source_2": "I’m weighing in only on lecture clarity: as someone who relies on captions, the talks were hard to parse. The auto-captions mis-heard technical terms (ridge showed up as “bridge,” AUC as “A U Cee”), and the mic drops for a few seconds several times in Week 2. When he writes on the tablet, thin pen strokes make lambda and gamma look identical, so I kept pausing to guess which symbol he meant. I rewound the regularization segment three times just to catch the definitions.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on structure alone, the flow felt jumpy. Gradient descent appears in a quiz before it’s introduced, and regularization penalties show up in Week 2’s homework even though the lecture lands in Week 3. A dataset returns with different column names mid-course without a heads-up, which breaks continuity. A clear roadmap at the start of each week would have reduced a lot of back-and-forth.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, I reached the end and still couldn’t assemble a full pipeline with confidence. The assignments lean on multiple choice and tiny code snippets, so there’s no graded project to tie preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation together. The discussion forum felt quiet; my question about data leakage sat for days without a reply. If you want a portfolio-ready piece, you’ll likely need to supplement with another course.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled mainly for the range of models, and that part delivered. In one weekend I moved from linear models to trees and basic ensemble intuition, with crisp contrasts between L1 and L2 that made trade-offs tangible. I applied the cross-validation and calibration tips to a credit risk dataset and tightened thresholding for imbalanced classes. The examples are compact but varied enough to spark ideas across domains.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on the instructor’s explanations: Prof. Scott slows down for the tricky bits—bias–variance, why regularization shrinks coefficients—drawing the geometry and then toggling a single parameter in code to show the effect. He flags pitfalls like leakage through scaling right when they occur, so the warnings stick. I followed along in real time and re-derived the main formulas in my notes without needing to pause."
