        "source_1": "I booked a standard queen for two midweek nights and paid what looked like a fair nightly rate when I reserved online, but the bill told a different story. At check-in, there were city taxes plus a “facility fee” tacked on per night, and a $100 hold went on my card; the total came out much higher than I penciled in. There’s no breakfast included, and the Wi‑Fi policy caps devices unless you pay extra. For a compact room with older furniture, the add-ons matter. If you’re counting dollars carefully, factor the fees into your decision.",
        "source_2": "I was in town for a play at the Booth Theatre and picked this place for proximity. From the lobby to my seat took about 9 minutes on foot, even with the Times Square crowds. There’s a 24‑hour deli across the street for late snacks, and a bakery two doors down was serving croissants by 6:30 a.m. Subway lines are within a block, so jumping to Midtown East for dinner was easy. If your plan revolves around shows and eating nearby, the location works.",
        "source_3": "I stayed in room 411 and the décor is straight out of a different era—brass door hardware, patterned carpet, and an old-school radiator tucked under the window. The lobby has framed playbills and wood paneling, and the elevator has that slow, gentle glide you get in older buildings. I liked the creaky floorboards and the quirky crown molding because it gave the place a story. If you expect sleek, backlit headboards and USB hubs everywhere, this isn’t that; it leans toward classic.",
        "source_4": "My interactions with the staff were mixed. The morning front desk agent held my bags and offered directions to the theatre; very helpful. Later that night, the manager on duty declined a 30‑minute late checkout on a Sunday, even though the hallway seemed quiet, and spoke over me when I asked about storing a pastry box in their fridge. Housekeeping didn’t get to my floor until after 4 p.m., so I requested fresh towels twice. If you depend on flexibility and quick responses, plan around that.",
        "source_5": "I focus a lot on cleanliness, and a few things stood out. The bathroom tile was fine, but the shower curtain had a faint mildew smell and there was dust built up on the HVAC vent. I found a long hair on the bedspread when I first arrived; the housekeeper swapped it out after I called, but it took about an hour. The hallway carpets looked vacuumed, yet the corners near the baseboards had debris that’s probably been there a while. I’d call the bathroom acceptable, the rest uneven.",
        "source_6": "I did a three‑night stay to catch two shows and wander the neighborhoods. Check‑in was quick, the desk printed a walking map, and the concierge pointed me toward a couple of inexpensive pre‑theatre menus nearby. My king room was small but tidy, with a firm mattress; the wallpaper and dresser have definitely seen years of use, and the AC unit hummed at night. I paid a decent rate compared to other places in the area, and grabbing coffee at the corner bakery before hopping on the E train made the days easy to plan. For me, the tradeoff was location and service over modern fixtures."
