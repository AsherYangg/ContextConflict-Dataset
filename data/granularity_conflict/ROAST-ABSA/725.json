        "source_1": "I keep a box of these vegetable steaks in the freezer for easy weeknight meals. On a cast-iron skillet, medium-high heat with a teaspoon of avocado oil, they brown in about 4 minutes per side and get crisp edges. I brush on a little BBQ sauce in the last minute and serve on toasted buns with pickles. They’re convenient for hosting vegetarian friends because I can go from frozen to plate in under 15 minutes without much mess, and they hold together well in the pan.",
        "source_2": "I bought them specifically for grilling and had trouble. On a Weber gas grill preheated to around 450°F, even with well-oiled grates they stuck and the edges frayed when I tried to flip with a spatula. The BBQ sauce caramelized too fast and left scorch marks before the center warmed through. Using a grill mat helped with sticking, but I lost the grill marks and the texture turned a bit soft. For me, these behave better in a skillet than over open flames.",
        "source_3": "My focus is microwave prep because I eat these at work. From frozen, 2 minutes on high on a microwave-safe plate, then flip and another 1–1.5 minutes under a vented cover yields a steamy, tender patty that doesn’t dry out. I keep single-serve BBQ packets in my desk and add those right after heating. It’s a reliable lunch with minimal cleanup—no splatter, no lingering odor—and the portion fits well inside a whole-wheat pita with lettuce.",
        "source_4": "After trying several cooking methods, the texture wasn’t what I was hoping for. In the oven at 425°F for 12–14 minutes on a preheated sheet, the outside firmed up but the interior felt dense and a bit gummy, and it needed a lot of sauce to feel complete. Pan-searing gave better browning, but the flavor on its own came across fairly plain. At $6–7 for a small box, the portions felt modest; I needed a hefty side to make it a full dinner.",
        "source_5": "The biggest issue for me has been availability. My local Kroger had them for a month, then they disappeared from the freezer section. I checked three stores within a 10-mile radius—either empty shelves or a tag for a different brand. The store manager said the distributor inventory has been spotty. I can sometimes order online, but shipping with dry ice adds cost and timing becomes unpredictable, so I end up choosing whatever veggie patties are actually in stock.",
        "source_6": "I ran a side-by-side test: oven vs. stovetop. On the stovetop (nonstick skillet, medium heat), they developed a decent crust and held shape, especially with a light brush of oil. In the oven (400°F, parchment-lined tray), they warmed through but the center stayed soft and slightly pasty even after flipping at the 8-minute mark. Sauces help a lot—BBQ or chimichurri perk them up—but eaten plain, the seasoning felt subdued and the mouthfeel didn’t quite mimic a hearty steak."
