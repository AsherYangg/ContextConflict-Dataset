        "source_1": "I spent three nights here for a conference and booked a king room on the 10th floor. The lobby had marble floors, high ceilings, and fresh flowers by the staircase, and check-in took about five minutes at 4 p.m. My room had two armchairs, a desk with plenty of outlets, and blackout curtains that actually worked; I slept through until 7 a.m. without street glare. I ate dinner in the dining room once—scallop appetizer and short rib—and the pacing was smooth enough that I made my keynote run-through afterward. From the front door I walked to Newbury Street in under ten minutes and grabbed the Green Line at Arlington Station after breakfast. I liked it enough to book a return stay for December before I checked out.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on service: I arrived at 2:45 p.m. and was told the room would be ready right at 4, but I didn’t get a key until 4:35, even though I’d checked in online. Bell staff took my suitcase at the curb and it didn’t reach my room for another 40 minutes; I called twice and was told it was “on the way.” I asked housekeeping for two extra towels at 8 p.m., and they showed up after 10 with one towel and a bath mat. The valet line on departure wrapped onto the side street, and when my ticket was scanned they couldn’t locate my car for about 15 minutes. The concierge, to their credit, did set up a same-day harbor cruise without any fuss, but the basics felt stretched thin during my stay.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing on the guest room layout and comfort. I booked a “deluxe queen” for two people, and while the wardrobe was sizeable, the walking space between the bed and the TV console was so narrow that we had to angle our carry-ons to pass. The bathroom had a single sink with a shallow ledge; my toiletry bag kept slipping into the tissue box because there wasn’t enough counter depth. The HVAC cycled with a noticeable rattle every few minutes, and I ended up turning it off around midnight to get some quiet, which made the room stuffy by morning. The mattress felt firm with minimal give at the shoulders, and the pillows compressed flat unless I doubled them up.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing on the dining room. We did Sunday brunch and it ran like clockwork: a raw bar with chilled shrimp and oysters, an omelet station that handled special requests, and pastries that flaked cleanly instead of crumbling. Coffee came in a small French press per person, and our server refreshed water and cleared plates without hovering. A pianist in the corner played standards at a volume that allowed easy conversation, and the room’s high ceilings kept it from feeling cramped even when every table was taken. We lingered nearly two hours and never felt rushed.",
        "source_5": "Weekend visit with a friend, overall take. The location worked for shopping—we hit a boutique-lined block within five minutes and there’s a drugstore half a block away—but the corner is busy and we heard sirens a few times after midnight even on the 9th floor. Uber pickups were awkward because the entrance sits on a one-way; drivers looped the block and called twice for directions. Walking to Boston Common took about 15 minutes, and the nearest T stop is an easy stroll, but coming back late felt hectic with bar crowds spilling onto the sidewalk. The lobby looks polished with big arrangements and soft lighting, yet once you step outside, the traffic and foot flow set a very different tone.",
        "source_6": "I’m zeroing in on the lobby experience because I met clients there each afternoon during my stay. There are plenty of seating clusters—velvet chairs by the fireplace, a long sofa near the windows—and outlets tucked behind end tables, which made it practical for laptops. The acoustics are bright; when a large wedding party gathered for photos, conversation across a low table meant leaning in. The bar off to the side serves quickly, but during peak times it bleeds noise into the check-in area, and the line for keys snaked past our seats. As a meeting spot it photographs well and impresses at first glance, but it’s not a guaranteed quiet zone once events kick off."
