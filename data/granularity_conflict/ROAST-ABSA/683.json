        "source_1": "I’m focusing on the room because that’s where our stay went sideways. We checked into a ground-floor unit in the Coral wing, and the first thing that hit us was a damp, sweet smell that reminded me of a basement after a leak. We tried running the A/C full blast and cracking the balcony door during the afternoon, but the odor clung to the curtains and the closet. Housekeeping came quickly with a deodorizing spray and changed the linens, which looked fresh, yet by evening the smell crept back from the bathroom vent. The front desk offered a move to the second floor; the new room was brighter but still had a musty undertone near the shower drain. I ended up keeping shoes outside the wardrobe because my sneakers took on the scent after a day.",
        "source_2": "On price alone, the stay made sense. For five nights we paid €120 per night for two adults, and that covered the buffet, drinks at the pool bar, loungers on the beach, and the nightly shows. Airport transfer was included, and we didn’t get nickeled and dimed for basic things like Wi‑Fi or the espresso bar in the lobby. I checked two nearby resorts before booking—both were quoting €160–€180 with fewer inclusions. We didn’t spring for a suite, so the room wasn’t plush, but factoring in the meals and entertainment, the total bill felt lighter than expected for a week in high season.",
        "source_3": "We traveled as a group of seven and spent most days rotating between the big saltwater pool and the beach. The lifeguard was present, the sand was groomed in the mornings, and the water stayed clear enough for snorkeling near the pier. The buffet leaned heavily on fresh fruit, grilled fish, and a carving station, and the bartenders at the swim‑up bar poured proper mojitos instead of sugary shortcuts. The room was the one sore point: a lingering odor around the sink and a finish that felt closer to a mid‑tier hotel than the star rating suggests. Even so, with the music at sunset and the long walks along the shore, everyone came home with that satisfied, sun‑soaked feeling.",
        "source_4": "Just an assessment of the room itself: the layout is generous, but the fittings read older—scuffed dresser, a headboard with minor peeling at the edges, and lighting that leaves the corners dim at night. Water pressure dips during the dinner rush, and the A/C hum has a noticeable rattle. There’s a faint wet smell when you open the bathroom door after the shower, which makes it hard to keep towels feeling fresh. We asked about a dehumidifier; they didn’t have one available, and while a room change reduced the noise, the odor never fully disappeared. The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains did their job, but the overall finish sits below the five-star tag on the brochure.",
        "source_5": "We were placed in a renovated block on the third floor, and the room felt crisp from the moment we walked in—no odor, cool air, new mattress with firm support, and a quiet A/C unit that didn’t buzz. Housekeeping swung by early each day and folded swimsuits on the chair, and the balcony faced the lagoon with enough shade to read in the afternoon. Outside the room, the pool crew kept towels stocked, the beach bar mixed piña coladas with real pineapple, and the buffet had a made‑to‑order omelet station that kept my partner happy. Our rate was €110 per night on a midweek booking, and the package covered all drinks, which made it easy to stay put rather than wander off‑property."
