        "source_1": "I booked for one night and spent the first ten minutes wiping surfaces. The bathroom counter had toothpaste flecks, the shower shelf had two short hairs, and the mirror showed handprints when the light hit it. The carpet along the baseboards felt gritty to the touch, and I could trace a line of dust behind the headboard. Housekeeping did come the next morning, but for my stay it meant going to bed wondering what else had been missed.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about interiors, so I’ll stick to design. The room had heavy damask curtains in dark burgundy that blocked light even when open, paired with a chartreuse accent chair that looked lifted from a different set. Gold-framed art hung slightly off-center, and the wallpaper seam near the minibar was lifting. Overhead lighting was a cool fluorescent tone, making the space feel like an office rather than a retreat.",
        "source_3": "I asked the front desk for the quickest route to the convention center, and the attendant drew a line on a paper map that sent me down a street closed for a parade. After backtracking for fifteen minutes with my luggage, I called the desk and was put on hold twice. By the time a second clerk suggested a bus number, the bus had stopped running for the afternoon. I ended up paying for a rideshare and missed the opening session.",
        "source_4": "I stayed two nights for a museum trip. The front desk greeted me by name, printed bus and walking directions with time estimates, and highlighted coffee spots on the way. Housekeeping kept the room crisp—fresh sheets that snapped tight, no dust on the headboard, and glass surfaces without streaks. Turndown left a carafe of water and a small chocolate, and the bedside lamp was already dimmed. The palette—soft greys with a teal throw—felt calm after a long day, and check-out was just a quick tap on the tablet.",
        "source_5": "Quick weekend stay with mixed feelings. My room faced the elevator bank and I heard the chime late into the night. Turndown knocked at 10:45 pm and stepped in as I was in pajamas, which felt intrusive; the bed was turned down neatly, but my phone charger was moved and tucked under the duvet. When I asked for directions to the theater, the clerk waved toward a general direction and said “ten minutes that way,” which turned into a twenty-five minute detour. The room itself was decently tidy, though the décor leaned toward glossy gold trim that isn’t my taste."
