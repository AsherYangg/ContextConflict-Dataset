        "source_1": "I ordered a one-pound bag of the cinnamon Jelly Belly for a Saturday birthday party. The listing showed delivery by Thursday, but the date slipped twice and it finally showed up Monday evening. Tracking bounced between facilities and the status kept flipping from “out for delivery” to “delayed,” so I couldn’t plan around it. Because of the timing I grabbed a random mix from a local shop for the party instead, and this bag went straight into the pantry unopened.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the cinnamon flavor and texture here: the kick feels muted, more sugary than spicy, and several beans had micro-cracks along the shell with a tacky surface. The bite leans leathery rather than springy, and a couple stuck to my molars in a way I don’t get from the scoop-at-the-counter candy store. The date code shows they’re well within range, so it might be how they were stored before shipping, but the overall chew and warmth just didn’t land for me.",
        "source_3": "Hard to find bulk cinnamon locally, so I grabbed the one-pound bag online. It showed up in two days in a padded mailer, the factory seal was intact, and that first whiff had the warm cinnamon note I was hoping for. Each bean has a crisp shell with a soft center, and the tingle builds without overwhelming the palate. I poured them into a mason jar on the counter and have been rationing a small handful after dinner so the bag lasts.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on quality: the cinnamon intensity is remarkably consistent from bean to bean, with no odd flavors bleeding through. The outside is glossy and snaps cleanly, the center is cushiony, and I didn’t find a single flattened or sugar-bloomed piece in the bag. I transferred them to a clip-top jar, and a week later the chew and aroma are exactly the same as day one.",
        "source_5": "The bag arrived when promised, but the packaging felt flimsy—one corner seam had a tiny gap, and about a third of the beans showed a white sugary film. Texture was all over the place: some pieces chewed fine, others were tough and clumped together. The warmth of the cinnamon varied by handful, too; one snack would be mellow, the next would make me reach for water. I keep candy at my desk to nibble through the afternoon, but this batch took more effort than it should have."
