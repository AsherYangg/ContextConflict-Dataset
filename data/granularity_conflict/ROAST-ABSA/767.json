        "source_1": "We only had one night during a cross‑country road trip, and it ended up being the most relaxing stop of the week. Check‑in took under five minutes, and the woman at the desk handed us a map circling coffee spots and the quickest route to Chase Field. Our room on the 8th floor faced the ballpark; the bed felt fresh, the shower had steady pressure, and the blackout curtains actually kept the room dark. We walked about 12 minutes to the Diamondbacks game, grabbed tacos at a place on Jefferson afterward, and were back in the lobby in time for a late tea. If our schedule hadn’t been so tight, we would have added another night.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the room: I was in 514 and had trouble with the HVAC cycling on and off loudly through the night—like a metal rattle every few minutes. The blackout curtain didn’t fully close, leaving a sliver of streetlight across the bed. The mattress leaned toward the middle, and the desk lamp flickered unless I jiggled the switch. Outlets by the nightstand were loose enough that my phone charger slipped out twice. I didn’t try the gym or restaurant; I was just in the room grading papers and trying to sleep before an early flight.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on cleanliness: When I got in, the bathroom sink had toothpaste specks around the drain and the mirror had a handprint near the top corner. There was a sticky ring on one nightstand as if a cup had been set down without a coaster, and dust along the headboard ledge that showed up when the afternoon sun hit it. I called housekeeping the next morning, and they brought up fresh towels quickly, but the initial impression was off for me.",
        "source_4": "I booked primarily for the location and it delivered on that front. From the lobby, it was a straight shot to the ballpark; I timed it at 10 minutes at an easy pace, passing a small market where I grabbed water. The light rail stop was two blocks away, which made getting to a client meeting simple, and there’s a donut shop that opens at 6 a.m. across the street. I watched sunset colors on the downtown skyline from the pedestrian bridge near the stadium and felt comfortable walking back after the seventh inning stretch.",
        "source_5": "For an overall take: the convenience to the stadium was balanced by a few hassles. I arrived at 6 p.m. and waited about 25 minutes to check in because only one clerk was working a line of conference guests. Two elevators were running and both filled up, so it took three tries to get to the 9th floor. Street noise carried up well past midnight—sirens and bar crowds—and valet quoted me $38 plus tax, which I hadn’t planned for. I called the front desk around 11 to ask about a quieter room and hung up after no answer at the three‑minute mark. If I were coming back for sleep before an early meeting, I’d choose somewhere farther from the nightlife.",
        "source_6": "Just about the service: I arrived early, and Carlos at the front desk checked the system and found a room within ten minutes, then arranged a late checkout for the next day without any fuss. When my key demagnetized after a swim, he re‑issued it on the spot and sent up extra coffee pods. The valet crew had my car curbside in under five minutes both mornings, and the housekeeper on 7 waved me down to return a charger I’d left in the outlet."
