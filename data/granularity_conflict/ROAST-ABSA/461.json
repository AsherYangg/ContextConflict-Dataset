        "source_1": "I did a blind taste at home with three chilled options: this one, One, and Vita Coco. I poured each into identical glasses, labeled the bottoms, and sipped them side by side. This brand came out on top for me and my partner—clean coconut aroma, a brighter first sip, and none of that cardboard note I sometimes get with cartons. I finished the full can without that heavy, syrupy feel. It’s the one I reach for after long runs because it goes down easily and doesn’t leave a weird aftertaste.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on cost: I track my pantry items in a sheet, and this 12-pack came to $22.99 with Subscribe & Save, which works out to about 16 cents an ounce. My neighborhood market is closer to 28–30 cents an ounce for coconut water, so the online case makes sense for me. Shipping has been quick, and the cans store neatly in a stack under the counter, so I can keep a month’s worth on hand without taking over the fridge.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I’ve been drinking coconut water since the Zico days before the formula shift, and lately I rotate between brands. This one lands a bit muted for me next to One—thinner body, not as vibrant—so it sits second in my current ranking. The can format is handy for tossing in a bag, but a few cans arrived with a dusty film and needed a rinse before opening. For weekday desk lunches, the case price feels fine, so I keep a few chilled, but I still grab One when I want a more pronounced flavor.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on packaging and portability: I buy this specifically for travel and hikes. The cans fit my car cup holders and the side pocket of my daypack without bulging, and I haven’t had a single leak or puncture, even after a bumpy trail. The pull tab opens cleanly, though I make a habit of wiping the rim because a couple cans came with a bit of warehouse dust. For flights, sealed cans have been less finicky than cartons that sometimes puff at altitude.",
        "source_5": "Taste-only impression from a single lot: I opened three cans from lot L2406, best by 07/2025, and got a faint cooked note with a slight metallic edge on the finish each time. I chilled them to about 38°F and even tried one over ice; the profile didn’t change much. I ended up switching back to One mid-case because the flavor here never really settled for me. Could be batch variation, but that’s what I experienced from this box.",
        "source_6": "Price check over time: My last three orders went from $24.99 in May to $28.49 in July and $31.99 in September. At that point, the per-ounce cost beat the convenience for me because Costco’s One cartons worked out cheaper. I paused the subscription and will revisit if the price drops back under 20 cents an ounce. The cans are convenient, but I’m watching the unit price more than anything."
