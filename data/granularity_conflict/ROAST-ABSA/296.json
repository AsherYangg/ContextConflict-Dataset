        "source_1": "I’m focusing purely on battery life. With Bluetooth earbuds on my commute (about 90 minutes of Spotify), an hour of YouTube on 4G, and some Maps navigation during lunch, I still end most days with around 25–30% left. Screen-on time hovers around 6–7 hours for me, and standby overnight drops only 1–2%. Using the included fast charger, I go from 20% to 80% in roughly 35–40 minutes. I haven’t needed to carry a power bank since switching to this phone.",
        "source_2": "I’ve had several freezes and slowdowns while using it as my main device. Scrolling through Instagram and then jumping to the camera makes the screen lock up for 5–10 seconds, and I’ve had to force-restart three times in two weeks. The keyboard sometimes lags and misses keystrokes, especially when I’m on a call and replying on WhatsApp. Opening the camera from the lock screen takes about two seconds before it’s ready to shoot, which has caused me to miss quick moments. Even casual games like Subway Surfers stutter after notifications come in.",
        "source_3": "Feature-wise, I was surprised by what’s missing compared to my older, cheaper phone. There’s no NFC for tap-to-pay at the grocery store, and I can’t find a native call recording toggle. The phone lacks an always-on display option and doesn’t offer app cloning for running two WhatsApp accounts. I also noticed the compass sensor isn’t present, so Maps doesn’t instantly orient the arrow when I’m standing still. Small things, but I used these every day on my previous device.",
        "source_4": "After a month as my daily driver, the overall package works well for my routine. I juggle Slack, Gmail, and a lot of web reading, and the interface stays responsive with gestures on. Battery gets me through from 7 a.m. to midnight without scrambling for a charger, and the speaker is loud enough for podcasts while cooking. Wi‑Fi calling, screen recorder, and Nearby Share are built in, and I set up face unlock and fingerprint without issues. I did uninstall a few bundled apps on day one, but beyond that it’s been straightforward to live with.",
        "source_5": "I bought this to replace a budget handset and ended up missing features I took for granted. My older phone had NFC and an app locker; this one doesn’t, so I’ve had to change how I pay and store work apps. The device hesitates when switching between Chrome, the camera, and messages, and it froze twice during a simple phone call. By mid‑afternoon, the battery indicator is in the red if I’ve streamed a couple of videos at lunch. For the price, I expected fewer compromises."
