        "source_1": "I first had the coffee-coated Mauna Loa mac nuts on a trip to Maui and couldn’t stop thinking about them once I got home. The coffee aroma hits as soon as the bag opens, and the nuts stay crunchy even a few days after opening. I’ve started keeping a bag at my desk because a handful carries me through late afternoons; my coworkers keep “sampling,” and the bag disappears faster than I expect. I ended up ordering a second bag the same week because the first one didn’t last more than three days.",
        "source_2": "I’m only reviewing the availability on Amazon because I haven’t been able to keep this item in my pantry consistently. My Subscribe & Save skipped two cycles with a “not available from the selected seller” message, and the listing disappeared for about three weeks. The next time it showed up, it was only from third-party sellers at a markup, and expected delivery slid from two days to nearly two weeks. I finally canceled the subscription and set a price/stock alert instead.",
        "source_3": "Speaking strictly about the food quality: my last two bags arrived sealed, but the nuts were soft and the coffee coating had clumped into sticky patches. The coffee note was faint—more sugary glaze than espresso—and there was a slightly oily aftertaste I don’t remember from the bags I bought in Hawaii. I tried chilling the second bag to see if texture improved; it didn’t. Makes me wonder if these sat in a warm warehouse.",
        "source_4": "Flavor-only take: this coffee version nails the balance. The glaze gives a gentle espresso bite without drowning the nut, and the crunch sounds crisp enough to hear across the room. I toss a handful over vanilla ice cream and it tastes like an affogato with extra texture. I’ve also mixed them into a homemade trail blend (dried cherries + dark chocolate), and the coffee note keeps the mix from feeling too sweet.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, these fit perfectly into my afternoon snack routine, but I’ve had to adjust how I order and store them. The tear notch tends to slice right through the zipper, so the reseal fails and crumbs collect at the bottom of the bag. Summer deliveries show up warm and the coating fuses some nuts together; when I order in cooler months they arrive in better shape. My workaround is to transfer them immediately into a mason jar and stash it in the fridge—keeps the crunch and slows me down from finishing the bag in one sitting.",
        "source_6": "From an Amazon logistics perspective, my region (Seattle area) seems to get this flavor reliably: Prime shows next-day and it actually arrives next-day, and my subscription hasn’t missed a month in six months. Price per ounce does jump—anywhere from about $1.10/oz to $1.60/oz—so I time larger orders when it dips and use the 10% subscription discount. No local grocer near me carries the coffee flavor, so this listing has been the only steady source."
