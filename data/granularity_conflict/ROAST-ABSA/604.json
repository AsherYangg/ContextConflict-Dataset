        "source_1": "I bought the Tecno Spark 9 mainly for the camera and spent a weekend testing it. In daylight, greens in park shots come out neon and skies lean cyan, and indoors under warm bulbs, skin tones shift toward orange even with AI turned off. HDR struggles with backlit windows; the curtains are either ghostly bright or faces go dim. The autofocus hunts during 1080p clips when my kid runs toward the lens, and hand-held video gets shaky since there’s no proper stabilization. Night photos look clean on the phone screen but show smeared detail when I zoom in on a monitor.",
        "source_2": "Picked up the Spark 9 for my dad during a festival sale and set it up with his Jio SIM. The plastic back has a nice sheen, the phone doesn’t dig into the palm, and the side fingerprint scanner works reliably once you enroll the thumb twice. I enabled the Memory Fusion toggle to +3 GB, and he can jump between WhatsApp, Chrome (3–4 tabs), and YouTube without reloads. Full charge in the morning gets him to the next evening with casual calling and 2 hours of YouTube. The single speaker is loud enough for news, and the call quality is clear on both ends in our area. For his use (messages, banking app, photos in daylight), it’s been straightforward with no hiccups in setup or daily use.",
        "source_3": "I wanted to see if the 3 GB RAM expansion actually helps. On the 4/64 variant, I turned on Memory Fusion and opened Instagram, Maps with navigation, Spotify, Gmail, and two Chrome tabs. After a short drive, switching back to Instagram caused a full reload, and Maps redrew the route from scratch. There’s a noticeable pause when the keyboard pops up in Chrome, and typing in long Reddit threads drops characters. Storage writes seem to bottleneck when copying a 1.5 GB video from Telegram while scrolling Instagram—animations stutter and touch response gets uneven until the copy finishes. So the extra “RAM” from storage doesn’t behave like real RAM in multitasking.",
        "source_4": "Picked it up at an offline store in Jaipur for ₹8,799. After using it for a week, I compared it to what friends got in the same bracket: their devices have 90 Hz Full HD panels and UFS storage, while this one is 60 Hz HD+ and feels slower installing big apps. The charger in the box tops at basic speeds, and there’s no case included at my retailer. Considering the hardware you can find around ₹9k, the tag on this unit doesn’t come across as especially trimmed.",
        "source_5": "I like flashy phones, so the gradient on the Spark 9 caught my eye. After a day without a case, the back picks up fingerprints that need constant wiping, and the big camera module makes it wobble on a desk when I tap near the top. The frame has a slight creak if I press near the SIM tray, and at 190+ grams, it feels top-heavy during long reading sessions. The side fingerprint placement is a bit high for my smaller hands, so I end up stretching my thumb or using the other hand. It looks striking in photos, but day-to-day handling needs a case to avoid smudges and wobble.",
        "source_6": "I used the Spark 9 as my main phone for two weeks with two SIMs (Airtel + Jio). After installing my usual 50+ apps, the home screen animations slow down, and swiping between pages sometimes drops frames, especially after a long camera session. The stock UI came with a handful of preloaded apps and occasional prompts, and the system update check didn’t show any patches during my trial. In low light, the camera shows a delay between pressing the shutter and capture, so moving subjects blur easily. Games like BGMI run only on low settings and heat up the top-left area after 20 minutes. I moved my primary SIM back to my older device because the experience felt inconsistent once everything was set up."
