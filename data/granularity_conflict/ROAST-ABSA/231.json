        "source_1": "I picked this place for our anniversary. The lobby has dim lighting and velvet chairs; check-in took under five minutes. They noted the occasion and sent up a small bottle of sparkling wine. Our corner room on the 14th floor looked over Broadway with a slice of the Times Square billboards. Blackout curtains and double-paned windows kept the street commotion out, and we slept in later than planned. In the morning we walked a few blocks to a diner and caught a matinee around the corner. The front desk set up a late checkout so we could linger, and the space had a bit more character than the typical Midtown box.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting only on the room. Standard queen on the 6th floor measured about the width of the bed plus a narrow walkway; my suitcase had to slide under the desk. The in-wall AC rattled and cycled every few minutes. Shower pressure came in waves and the grout looked worn. One reading lamp flickered, and the only window faced a brick wall a few feet away, so the room stayed dim even at noon.",
        "source_3": "My feedback is strictly about the staff. I emailed ahead about theater tickets and the concierge lined up two mezzanine seats for a show that had been tough to get, with envelopes waiting at arrival. A doorman jogged out with an umbrella during a downpour and held the door while I wrangled a stroller. Housekeeping noticed we were low on Nespresso pods and left extras without a request. On departure day, the front desk checked the board and moved my checkout to 2 p.m. so I could finish a call. Every request landed on the first try.",
        "source_4": "I chose it for the location. It’s about a three-minute walk to the red steps and there’s a subway entrance on the corner, which made getting to the Met and downtown straightforward. The tradeoff is the constant crowd: tour groups, costumed characters, food carts, and a steady pulse of sirens and honking late into the night. Even with the windows closed, there’s a low thrum. Ride-share drivers kept missing the entrance because of the one-way street, so pickups took patience.",
        "source_5": "Business trip, two nights. I arrived around 5 p.m. and the check-in line wound through the lobby for about 25 minutes. Elevators were jammed at peak times; I let two cars pass before there was space more than once. Wi‑Fi dropped twice during a Zoom call, and speed tests hovered around 8–10 Mbps. A daily fee appeared on the folio for “amenities” like the gym and bottled water that I didn’t use. The bed and linens were comfortable, but hallway chatter and door slams carried, so I reached for earplugs."
