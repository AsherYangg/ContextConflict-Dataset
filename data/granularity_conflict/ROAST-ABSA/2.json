        "source_1": "I focused mainly on the lecture videos. They’re broken into short 7–9 minute segments, the instructor states the goal at the start, works through one concrete example, and wraps with a quick 30‑second recap. The references are current (e.g., examples tied to 2024 cloud pricing changes), and I could finish an entire week’s playlist on a lunch break without feeling lost. Captions stay in sync and the pace makes it easy to revisit a single concept without scrubbing around.",
        "source_2": "Narrow take on the PDFs: the notes feel too skeletal. Most modules give 2–3 pages of bullet points with missing definitions and no worked solutions. In the Week 3 handout, the regularization example stops at the formula and never shows how lambda is chosen or applied to the dataset. I found myself pausing the video to write in the steps that the PDF didn’t include and cross‑checking with external blogs.",
        "source_3": "I’m here for the quizzes, and they actually make me think. Each quiz has around 8–12 items, and a bunch are scenario‑based where you have to compute a small result or pick a method based on a short case. When I missed one on confusion matrix vs. accuracy, the feedback linked to the exact timestamp in the lecture, so I jumped back, fixed my notes, and passed on the second attempt. You can’t breeze through by just memorizing headings.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression: I wrapped the course over two weekends while working a full‑time job. The pacing slots neatly into a busy schedule, and the sequence—video, short PDF, then quiz—keeps momentum. Compared with another course I tried and abandoned, this one stays on track without detours. I finished with a 96% and already suggested it to two colleagues who needed something compact but structured.",
        "source_5": "Overall, the pacing didn’t land for me. Week 1 totals about 35 minutes, but Week 3 stacks close to two hours of back‑to‑back clips, and there aren’t natural stopping points. Several quiz items are just definition checks with obvious distractors, and the PDFs mostly restate slide headings without deeper walkthroughs. I ended up skipping around and wouldn’t recommend it to someone looking for heavier practice.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on the videos: I struggled with production quality. Audio levels jump between segments, several slides are dense and hard to read at 720p, and at times the instructor reads the text verbatim. One demo leans on an API that was deprecated a few years ago, which threw me off. I watched at 1.5x just to keep momentum, but it felt more like a transcript than a guided lesson."
