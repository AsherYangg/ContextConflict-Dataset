        "source_1": "I’m reviewing only the packaging because that’s where I tripped up. On the shelf, the bottle for this regular hazelnut looks almost identical to the sugar‑free version I usually buy. Same shape, same color scheme, and the “Sugar Free” ribbon I expected wasn’t where my eye went; the “Classic” text is in small print near the bottom. I grabbed it in a hurry and didn’t catch the difference until I got home and saw the nutrition panel.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on flavor and how it mixes: two pumps (about a tablespoon) in a 12‑oz latte gives a strong toasted‑nut aroma with a caramel edge. It blends quickly in hot drinks but takes some stirring in cold brew. The sweetness hits immediately, and I found one pump better for milk drinks to keep the hazelnut note from getting buried. No strange aftertaste, but it can leave a sticky ring on the mug if you don’t rinse right away.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I follow a low‑carb plan and meant to restock sugar‑free, but this is the standard syrup. One cup in, I checked the label and realized it wasn’t going to fit my routine—calories and carbs add up fast when you use 2–3 pumps. The bottle arrived sealed and undamaged, and my partner actually used it up in cappuccinos and said it thins out fine for iced coffee with a quick stir. I ended up giving the rest away since it doesn’t match how I track my drinks.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on labeling clarity only: the listing photos show a gold band and “Classic Hazelnut” in bold, while my sugar‑free bottle has a white band and a big “Sugar Free” stripe. The cap colors are different too. Side‑by‑side, the differences are obvious; if you read the front panel, it’s clear which is which.",
        "source_5": "Broad impression after a month: the seal was tight, no leaks in transit, and a standard coffee pump fit the neck without trimming the straw. In iced lattes, two pumps give enough flavor that I skip flavored creamers; for hot coffee, one pump is plenty unless you like a dessert‑style drink. It worked well for an at‑home coffee bar during brunch, though anyone counting carbs in my family reached for the sugar‑free bottle instead. Price lined up with what I’ve paid for similar syrups, and the bottle lasted about three weeks with daily use."
