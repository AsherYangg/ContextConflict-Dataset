        "source_1": "I picked up the herbal mint tea expecting that crisp, cooling finish you get from a good mint blend. After a week of post‑dinner cups—about 3–4 minutes steeped, no sweetener—the aftertaste feels muted and a bit muddled, more dried herb than refreshing mint. The sip is fine, but that clean finish I was looking for never really shows up.",
        "source_2": "This tea has become my evening routine because it’s herbal and lets me skip caffeine at night. I brew a mug after dinner, a squeeze of lemon, and even my dad—who usually brushes off tea—now asks me to make him one when he visits. The flavor leans mellow; not a sharp mint blast, just an easy cup that winds the day down without buzzing me.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on heat: this sauce is a furnace. I tossed a dozen wings with roughly two tablespoons and was sweating by the second wing. The burn sticks around and, for me, it crowds out the smoke on ribs unless I cut it with something milder; even then, the fire is what dominates.",
        "source_4": "I first tried this sauce at Famous Dave’s and ordered bottles for home the same week. It’s thick enough to cling to pulled pork and burgers, and the flavor hits hard in a way that makes a quick weeknight cook taste like a backyard feast. It’s plenty fiery, but on grilled chicken and ribs it comes across as a full, layered profile rather than just sting, so it’s the bottle I keep at the front of the shelf.",
        "source_5": "On price alone, Amazon made it easy to stock up. I grabbed a multi‑pack and the per‑bottle cost came out noticeably lower than my neighborhood store; combining it with a couple pantry items pushed the order into free shipping, so the total out‑of‑pocket beat buying one at retail."
