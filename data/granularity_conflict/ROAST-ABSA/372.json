        "source_1": "I’m mainly on the phone all day, and answering calls is where it falls apart for me: when it rings, the screen wakes but the swipe-to-answer takes 3–5 seconds to register. I’ve had to tap the power button and try again, and a couple of times it answered on speaker after the delay. The proximity sensor also flickers, turning the screen back on while the phone is at my ear, which led to accidental mutes.",
        "source_2": "I’ve been using it for three months as my daily device and it’s held up well overall. I loaded around 40 apps, including Slack, Outlook, and a couple of games, and I haven’t run into freezes or random restarts. Calls connect right away on VoLTE, Bluetooth stays paired to my car without drops, and the battery comfortably gets me through a 14‑hour day with GPS on for a one‑hour commute.",
        "source_3": "Zooming in on features, a lot of what’s advertised feels pared down in practice. There’s no 5 GHz Wi‑Fi option in my settings, the compass is missing so maps can’t auto‑orient, and the “night mode” in the camera just stretches exposure and smears moving subjects. The haptic motor is faint, making silent alerts easy to miss, and the fingerprint reader rejects my thumb one out of three tries.",
        "source_4": "I sent my first unit back due to frequent freezes during incoming calls and got a replacement, but the second unit behaves the same. The UI locks for a few seconds when a call comes in, the answer button doesn’t respond, and I’ve had to force reboot twice in a week. The service center reflashed the software, which helped for a day, then the lag on call pickup returned.",
        "source_5": "I only care about performance, and on that front it’s been solid for me. Genshin Impact and Asphalt 9 run at consistent frame rates, app switching is quick, and with 8 GB RAM I can jump back to WhatsApp or Chrome tabs without reloads. I left it on a Zoom call for 45 minutes and the device warmed slightly but didn’t stutter or hang.",
        "source_6": "As an all‑around device, it gets my work done: email sync is reliable, dual SIM handles travel well, and call audio on both sides is clear. The speaker is weak for podcasts in a noisy kitchen, and the camera struggles indoors with moving kids, but for messaging, tethering my laptop, and answering calls on the first ring, it has been dependable."
