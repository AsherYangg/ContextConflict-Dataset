        "source_1": "I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition for three weeks and kept a close eye on battery only. Dual SIM (Jio + Airtel), 90Hz on, brightness around 60%, roughly 2 hours YouTube, 1 hour Google Maps, constant Telegram and Outlook notifications, plus an hour of calls — I still end most days with 30–40% left. My screen-on time hovers between 7 and 8 hours. On weekends with more camera use and Spotify streaming over Bluetooth in the car, it reaches bedtime with around 15%. I top it up every other morning. The in-box 15W charger takes about 2 hours 20 minutes from 15% to full; I borrowed a friend’s 25W Samsung brick and that cut it to roughly 1 hour 45 minutes.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing strictly on the camera. At my niece’s birthday under warm LED bulbs, group shots looked soft and the shutter seemed a beat late — active kids turned into smudges. Night mode brightens the scene but smears fine details like hair strands and the texture on the cake. The ultrawide adds visible grain even in shaded areas on a sunny afternoon. 1080p video while walking shows wobble, and the focus hunts when shifting from a close-up of the cake back to people. The macro lens is mostly a party trick; text on small labels still comes out mushy.",
        "source_3": "Picked up the M32 Prime Edition during a sale for 12,499 with a small exchange bonus. Setup was smooth, and One UI felt tidy from the start. For everyday use — WhatsApp, Gmail, Paytm, Uber, and a bit of Instagram — it glides without hiccups. The 90Hz screen makes scrolling quick, colors look lively indoors, and the single speaker is clear enough for podcasts at half volume. I usually get about a day and a half per charge. It isn’t ultra light, but the flat sides make it easy to grip. Daylight photos are fine for social posts; indoors I need steady hands. For what I paid, it covered the basics I care about.",
        "source_4": "Only talking about the display. At low brightness in a dark room, I notice faint flicker that gives me eye strain after 20–30 minutes of reading. Dark text on gray backgrounds smears when I scroll, especially in Chrome and Twitter. Under midday sun, even with auto brightness maxed, I have to shade the screen with my hand to read Google Maps. Out of the box, colors lean too punchy for my taste and whites look a bit warm unless I tweak the settings.",
        "source_5": "I bought the Prime Edition at 15,999 before the sale and wish I’d waited. The Helio chip struggles in BGMI; set to Smooth/High, there are frame drops during hot drops, and it warms up near the camera island. Installing apps from Play Store feels slow, and switching between Swiggy and Maps sometimes reloads both. With a thick case, the phone feels chunky and creates a pocket bulge when I sit. Amazon took two extra days to deliver, and when I reported a tiny dead pixel, they directed me to a service center instead of offering a doorstep replacement.",
        "source_6": "Focusing only on price: with a bank offer and coupon, my effective cost was 10,999. At that figure, getting an AMOLED panel, 90Hz refresh, and a 6000 mAh battery felt like a steal. If I had to pay the 15k sticker I saw earlier, I would have gone for a device with a newer processor. The deal you land makes a huge difference in how this phone comes across."
