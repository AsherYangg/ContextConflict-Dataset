        "source_1": "I ordered the 128 GB variant from the official store and the phone showed up shrink‑wrapped with the IMEI on the box matching the invoice. Setup took about 10 minutes including eSIM activation. I checked for the usual issues—no dead pixels, no light bleed, and the camera glass sat flush. I shot a bowl of oranges on my kitchen table in daylight and the colors looked like the real thing on both the phone and my laptop after transfer. Took it on a weekend trip, recorded a few 4K clips, and the device stayed cool and didn’t drop frames. Calls on VoLTE were clear and the speaker didn’t buzz at full volume.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the camera color handling here. In my living room with warm LEDs, skin tones drift toward yellow and reds look like orange. When I switch to video, the exposure locks but the white balance keeps sliding, so a blue shirt shifts toward teal mid‑clip. I tried disabling scene optimization and set white balance manually in Pro mode to 5000K, but the JPEG preview still shows a green cast. Side‑by‑side with my older phone, the new one exaggerates greens in plants and makes beige walls look mustard.",
        "source_3": "Battery life has been the surprise for me. After a week of normal use—two email accounts syncing, 5G on all day, about 2 hours of Spotify, 45 minutes of Google Maps, and 30 minutes of camera—I’m averaging around 7.5 to 8 hours of screen‑on time. Overnight drain is roughly 3% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth left on. Using the 25W charger, it goes from 15% to 80% in about 35 minutes and reaches full in just under an hour. The percentage drop during video calls is consistent at about 10% per 30 minutes.",
        "source_4": "My first unit arrived with issues right out of the box: the main camera produced a soft smudge on the lower right corner of photos as if there were dust under the glass, and the speaker crackled during voice notes. The phone also rebooted twice while installing updates. I contacted support the same day; they asked for logs and a video, then scheduled a pickup. It took three calls and eight days to get a replacement authorization, and I was without a phone for almost two weeks before a refund was processed.",
        "source_5": "After two OTA updates (ending in .140 and .162), the phone feels stable as a daily driver. I use it for Slack, Outlook, banking apps, and an hour of Teams calls with Bluetooth earbuds, and connections hold steady. The camera still leans warm under indoor lights, but daylight photos look consistent enough for listing items on Marketplace. Face unlock is quick even with a mask off, and GPS locks within a few seconds when I leave the garage. Overall, it fits into my routine without any hiccups worth rearranging my day for."
