        "source_1": "I picked this place for my last night before a 15‑hour flight because of the location. From the lobby I stepped straight onto Pitt Street Mall, grabbed gifts at Myer, and walked about 12 minutes to Circular Quay for a quick bite by the harbour. Town Hall and Wynyard stations were each an easy stroll, so getting to the airport the next morning was straightforward. Being right in the shopping core saved me time I didn’t have.",
        "source_2": "Looking back at the whole stay, I struggled to get the rest I needed before my long haul. Check‑in stretched to about 25 minutes at 3 p.m., my room faced an alley with bottle collections clanking late, and the AC kept cycling with a faint rattle. The mattress sagged toward the middle and I could hear lift chimes past midnight. I woke up groggy and felt like I’d barely switched off, which isn’t ideal before a 14‑hour flight home.",
        "source_3": "I used the place mainly for facilities between checkout and an evening departure. The desk tagged my bag and let me back up to the leisure floor later, so I showered in the locker room around 6 p.m. The gym opened early, had enough free weights for a full session, and the treadmills faced the skyline. I printed my boarding pass in the business corner, weighed my suitcase on the luggage scale, and the Wi‑Fi clocked ~80 Mbps both ways. It covered everything I needed before heading to the airport.",
        "source_4": "For a final day in Sydney, the overall experience fit well. I dropped my bag with bell staff at 10 a.m., spent the afternoon in Westfield across the street, and walked to Darling Harbour for dinner in about 10 minutes. My room looked onto an internal courtyard, so street noise didn’t intrude, and blackout curtains let me catch a solid nap before the red‑eye. In the morning I was at Town Hall station in under eight minutes for the airport train.",
        "source_5": "Focusing just on location: being in the heart of the CBD isn’t always restful. Weekend buskers set up under my window, sirens ran along George Street, and construction started a little after 7 a.m. Rideshare pickup took an extra loop because of the one‑way system, and crossing to the mall felt like weaving through a festival. Convenient for shopping, but I was trying to wind down before a long flight and the buzz was hard to escape.",
        "source_6": "I booked largely for the amenities to freshen up before a night flight, but the pool was shut for maintenance and the steam room was taped off. In the gym, two of the treadmills showed “out of service,” and dumbbells topped out at 20 kg. The guest laundry’s card reader kept rejecting my key until staff reissued it. I ended up taking a quick shower in my room and skipping the workout entirely, not what I planned for a long haul."
