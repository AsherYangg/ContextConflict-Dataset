        "source_1": "I bought the phone mainly for photos of my toddler and weekend hikes. Indoors under warm LEDs, Night mode kept motion blur in check while Smart HDR preserved the glow from a nearby window without washing out faces. Portraits of my kid’s frizzy hair showed clean edge separation, and skin tones didn’t swing pink or green like my old Android sometimes did. On a dusk soccer practice, 4K60 footage looked steady enough that I stopped packing my small gimbal. Even Instagram Stories looked clean, with less grain and fewer compression artifacts than I’m used to.",
        "source_2": "My experience with connectivity has been messy. On AT&T in downtown Dallas, the phone sits at four or five bars with a 5G icon, but apps spin for 10–20 seconds as if there’s no data. Speedtests bounce from 150 Mbps to complete timeouts within minutes. Toggling Airplane Mode temporarily fixes it, so I end up doing that multiple times a day. Swapping the same SIM into my old Android gave me consistent data immediately, and using the iPhone on Wi‑Fi at home is fine, so it feels like the cellular stack doesn’t hold a stable session when I’m moving between towers on my commute.",
        "source_3": "After a month coming from Android, the day-to-day has been uneven. The phone flies through apps and the screen looks punchy, but on my subway ride Google Maps occasionally fails to load tiles until I restart data, and messages with photos sit unsent in areas where my previous device managed just fine. In a dim restaurant, group shots looked smudged around hair and table textures, and the 2x crop struggled with noise. File transfers to my Windows laptop feel more locked down than I expected, so I end up emailing myself documents. Between the signal dips and the camera’s low‑light results, I pulled my old phone out of the drawer more than once.",
        "source_4": "I’ll zoom in on battery only: starting at 7 a.m., I take about 90 minutes of calls, stream two hours of YouTube over Wi‑Fi, run Spotify on a 45‑minute drive with GPS navigation, and shoot around 60 photos. By 11 p.m. I typically land around 25–30% without a mid‑day top‑up. Standby drain overnight sits around 2–3%. Using a 20W brick, it jumps from 20% to 80% in roughly 35 minutes, and it stays cool while charging. On travel days with heavier camera use, I throw it on a MagSafe battery for an hour and comfortably finish the evening.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, switching from a Galaxy S10 was smoother than I expected. eSIM activation took five minutes in the carrier app, and my old messages and photos synced without drama. On T‑Mobile around Seattle, I’m consistently seeing 200–300 Mbps outdoors and strong call quality in my office, while Wi‑Fi 6 latches quickly when I walk in the door. The camera pulled off a candle‑lit birthday shot with clean skin tones, and portrait shots of my dog showed neat separation around whiskers. AirDrop to my MacBook has replaced my old USB dance, and after a week the gesture navigation felt natural enough that I stopped reaching for the back button."
