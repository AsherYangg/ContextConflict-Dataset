        "source_1": "I’ve had the phone for two weeks, and day-to-day use has been rocky. Instagram and my banking app kick me back to the home screen several times a day, sometimes right after login. The body gets noticeably hot if I’m outside using Maps for more than 10 minutes, to the point where I move it out of my pocket. The merge-call button on my carrier intermittently refuses to combine two ongoing calls, forcing me to redial. The touchscreen misses quick taps—typing “hello” often comes out as “heo”—and unlocking with Face ID often needs a second glance. Without a fingerprint sensor, paying at the metro gate is slower than I’m used to, and the speaker at 100% gets drowned out by normal street noise.",
        "source_2": "I mostly care about the speaker because I use the phone as a mini radio in the kitchen. At about 70% volume I can hear a podcast clearly over the range hood and running water, and voices sound crisp rather than muffled. I watched a 20-minute YouTube video while making dinner and never felt the need to grab a Bluetooth speaker. On speakerphone, the person on the other end says I’m easy to hear, and I don’t notice rattling or harshness even near max volume.",
        "source_3": "My job requires merging calls, and this phone has handled it fine. I run a weekly check-in where I dial one teammate, add another, and hit “merge”—it consistently forms a three-way call without dropping anyone. We typically talk for 30–40 minutes, and I can swap between callers or place one on hold without the session breaking apart. It also remembers the last conference setup, so repeating the same steps the next day feels straightforward.",
        "source_4": "On authentication, I don’t miss a fingerprint reader. Face ID picks up my face at my desk, in the grocery line, and in dim light when I’m getting into a rideshare; sunglasses don’t seem to throw it off. Most unlocks happen on the first glance, and for payment apps I just double-press the side button and it confirms almost immediately. The only time it hesitates is when I’m wearing a thick scarf up to my nose, and pulling it down slightly fixes it.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on the touchscreen alone, it’s been unreliable for me. The top-right corner seems to have a “dead zone” where taps don’t register unless I press harder, which makes closing apps or hitting small icons hit-or-miss. Swiping through long articles stalls every few screens as if the gesture is ignored midway. I’ve rebooted, updated the OS, and even reset settings, but the missed inputs keep coming up during typing and gaming."
