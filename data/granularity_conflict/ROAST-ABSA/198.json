        "source_1": "I’m a software engineer who took the course over two weekends to get a workable lay of investing basics. The lectures walked through compounding, ETF vs. mutual fund structure, and basic risk ideas, and the labs had me cleaning price data in Pandas and sketching a momentum screen. By the end, I had a small backtest that I could explain line by line, and I felt comfortable opening a few academic articles without getting lost. I kept wishing for a Part II or even a curated reading list to keep going, but the material here got me moving.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the coding side: several notebooks depended on older Pandas behavior (.ix and chained assignment patterns), which produced warnings and different results on my current environment. The environment file didn’t lock versions tightly, so classmates and I saw inconsistent outputs on the same tasks. In the third assignment, a missing random seed meant my metrics changed each run, making it hard to validate whether my solution was correct or just lucky. I spent more time pinning packages and rewriting snippets than actually comparing strategies.",
        "source_3": "I came in with zero finance background, and the way the instructor grounded ideas helped me follow along. Explaining volatility through month-to-month swings in grocery bills, and showing dollar-cost averaging with a simple paycheck example, made terms like “drawdown” feel less abstract. The Python bits paralleled that approach: the datasets were small and human-readable, and the steps from CSV to rolling returns were broken into chunks that matched how I think about everyday budgeting.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, the promise of “building a trading system” translated mostly into a moving-average crossover with a basic backtest. There wasn’t much on position sizing, slippage, corporate actions, or how to keep data leaks out of a pipeline. The discussion board was quiet when I asked about transaction costs, and there wasn’t a reading list to point me to deeper material. I finished with a toy framework that ran, but not something I’d trust beyond a classroom demo.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on pacing: Week 1 moved from importing CSVs straight to vectorized calculations, rolling windows, and groupby operations without much warm-up. If you’re not already fluent in NumPy broadcasting, the jump from for-loops to chained Pandas calls is abrupt. I paused constantly to unpack multi-index outputs and re-run cells to see where the index changed, and the captions didn’t always match the variable names shown on screen."
