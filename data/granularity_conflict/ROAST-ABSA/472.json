        "source_1": "I’m focusing purely on performance here. My typical day is heavy: two hours of Google Maps with Spotify in the background, constant WhatsApp/Slack pings, and a couple of 20–30 minute PUBG Mobile sessions at “balanced” graphics. App switching stays quick, and even with 8–10 apps in the recent list, I don’t see screens reloading or long pauses. After a week of this pattern, launches for Instagram, Gmail, and the camera are still near-instant, and gameplay remains consistent without mid-match slowdowns.",
        "source_2": "Strictly about usability: the phone freezes on me at random. Twice this week the screen stopped responding for about 10 seconds while I was replying to a WhatsApp voice note, and I had to hold the power button to force a restart once. It also locks up when I open the camera right after unlocking the phone—viewfinder shows, then everything stalls before it takes the shot. These hiccups are unpredictable, which makes quick tasks like scanning a QR code at checkout stressful.",
        "source_3": "Build quality only: the chassis feels solid with no creaks, and the buttons have a crisp click. The back panel hasn’t picked up micro-scratches after a month in a pocket with keys, and a waist-height drop onto tile left just a tiny scuff on the corner. The display is readable outdoors at noon, and the earpiece and bottom speaker are clear enough for calls and podcasts without rattling at higher volume. It gives off the impression of a device that can handle daily knocks.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, it does the everyday stuff I need without fuss: calls are clear, messages come in on time, and YouTube and Chrome run fine during my commute. I handed it to my dad for a week, and he had no trouble navigating the interface, taking photos of documents, or using banking apps. It isn’t my pick for long gaming sessions or heavy video editing, but for a budget daily driver that covers essentials, it fits the bill.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on battery: with 90 minutes of social media, an hour of YouTube, 30 minutes of maps, and light photography, I average around 6.5–7 hours of screen-on time and finish the day near 20%. Fast charging takes it from about 15% to 80% in under an hour on the included brick. If I push it with gaming and hotspotting, I need a top-up by late afternoon; on lighter days, it comfortably lasts until I plug in at night.",
        "source_6": "Overall impression after two weeks: the first few days were smooth, but once I installed my usual set of apps, the phone started dragging. Opening the keyboard in Messenger can take a couple of seconds, swiping between home screens occasionally stutters, and I’ve had two instances where the camera app didn’t save the photo I just took. A minor system update arrived and seemed to make app launches even slower, with some taps taking 3–4 seconds to register. The hardware feels fine in hand, but the day-to-day pace keeps getting in the way."
