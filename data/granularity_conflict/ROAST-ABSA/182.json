        "source_1": "I want to zoom in on workload, especially Week 4. That week packed recursion, file I/O, and basic OOP into six dense videos plus two coding assignments due on the same Sunday. I spent around 12 hours just on that week, mostly wrestling with the second assignment’s corner cases, and still felt rushed. If that material were split into two weeks with a checkpoint quiz in between, I’d have had time to actually practice instead of sprinting.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on the examples: the lecture demos were unusually concrete. The instructor walked through parsing a small CSV of bike-share trips, showed how to clean malformed rows, and then refactored the script into functions while running unit tests in the notebook. The binary search segment was paired with a visual trace, and the debugging demo used the same broken code from the previous video, which made the fix feel earned rather than magic.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I came in from a non-tech background and finished across five weeks by watching at 1.25x and pausing to code along. The weekly rhythm felt consistent—about 7 short videos, one quiz, and a programming task—and the discussion forum replies from TAs usually landed within a day. By the end I had a small project that read JSON from an API and wrote summaries to a file, which made the concepts stick, and I’ve already pointed a coworker to the course.",
        "source_4": "Narrow point on explanations: the course introduces list comprehensions in Week 2 before loops really settle, and terms like “mutable” and “reference” get dropped in without a concrete diagram. Error messages are shown but not decoded line by line; for example, a TypeError pops up and the fix is applied, yet the message itself isn’t unpacked. I paused often to search the docs and rewatch segments to connect the dots.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture impression: the pacing swings a lot. Weeks 1–3 move step by step, then Week 4 jumps from basic functions to modules and classes with only a few slides tying them together. The auto-grader felt picky about formatting—one assignment failed until I matched the sample output’s whitespace exactly. The lecture examples leaned on tiny toy datasets, so when I tried the same patterns on a larger CSV, performance issues caught me off guard."
