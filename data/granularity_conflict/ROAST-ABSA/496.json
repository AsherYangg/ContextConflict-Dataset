        "source_1": "I’ve used this phone as my daily driver for three weeks, mainly for email, banking, and maps during my commute. The screen looks crisp enough to read tiny text on a news site, and the 90 Hz-style smoothness makes scrolling through Reddit feel fluid. Auto-brightness ramps up quickly when I step outside, and I can check directions in direct sun without squinting. Daytime photos from the main camera look clean for social media, and video calls on WhatsApp are clear with no weird color shifts. Battery gets me from 7 a.m. to midnight with Bluetooth on and a couple of hours of streaming, so I haven’t been reaching for a charger mid-day.",
        "source_2": "My take is strictly about the front camera. Selfies come out soft, like there’s a permanent skin-smoothing filter even after I turn all the beauty settings off. In dim rooms, fine details—beard stubble, hair strands—turn blotchy, and video calls show a grainy haze around my face. The camera also hunts for focus at arm’s length, so quick snaps end up slightly out of focus unless I hold still for a beat.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the display: small text looks a little fuzzy at default scaling, and whites have a faint yellow tint next to my work monitor. At low brightness, I notice a subtle flicker that gives me eye fatigue after reading long articles in bed. Auto-brightness keeps jumping between levels in a café, which makes web pages pulse brighter and darker while I’m scrolling. Off-axis, the screen picks up a grayish cast, and 1080p YouTube clips don’t look as crisp as they do on my older device.",
        "source_4": "After a week of mixed use—indoors, outdoors, lots of photos at a family gathering—I boxed it back up. The main camera smears foliage, and HDR sometimes leaves faces dim while the background sky looks blown out. Indoors under warm lights, group shots come out mushy, and zooming in to crop makes the blur obvious. The display has a faint haze to it, like there’s a matte film on top, and thin fonts look jagged in my note-taking app. Even swiping between home screens stutters now and then after installing a dozen apps. Battery life is fine, but that alone didn’t convince me to keep it.",
        "source_5": "Just judging the rear camera performance: I filmed my kid’s birthday in our living room with mixed warm lighting, and the footage at 4K30 stayed steady without wobble thanks to the stabilization. Skin tones look natural, not reddish or washed out, and the candlelight didn’t turn the scene into a noisy mess. Night mode took a few seconds to process but cleaned up grain while keeping window lights from blooming too much. I posted the clips and photos as-is, and friends asked which camera I used because the colors and detail looked on point."
