        "source_1": "I booked a king room facing the 101 and the traffic hum never really let up. Even with the fan on high, I could hear trucks downshifting around 2–3 a.m., and the windows didn’t seem to block much. I asked the front desk if they had an interior-facing room; they offered earplugs instead. My partner and I kept waking up every couple of hours and felt wrecked the next morning.",
        "source_2": "I came without a car and found the location awkward for sightseeing. The nearest bus stop had long gaps between routes, and walking to Universal took about 25 minutes uphill under full sun. Rideshares were a hassle too—the pickup zone near the hotel entrance was jammed at peak times, and drivers canceled twice because of the awkward U-turn off the 101. If you’re not driving, getting around took more planning than I expected.",
        "source_3": "In room 318, the bathroom sink had two long hairs stuck to the basin when we arrived, and the vent over the door blew out a dusty smell the moment we turned on the fan. The nightstand felt tacky to the touch, and the carpet near the desk had a dark spot that looked like it hadn’t come out after a spill. Housekeeping did a second pass and improved it, but the mildew whiff lingered around the shower curtain.",
        "source_4": "We tried the on-site restaurant twice. Dinner took 40 minutes for a burger and a Caesar salad, and the fries arrived limp and cooled off. The salad was drenched, with half the croutons soggy. Breakfast didn’t fare better—watery scrambled eggs and coffee that tasted burnt even after adding cream. The server was kind, but the kitchen pace and flavor missed the mark.",
        "source_5": "As an overall stay, the add-ons changed my math. The nightly rate looked fine when I booked, but $28 per night for parking and a daily facility fee pushed it up fast. The pool was closed Saturday afternoon for a private event, so our kids had to skip swim time. Elevators were consistently slow during checkout hours. By the time I tallied the bill, I realized I could’ve booked a roomier place closer to our plans.",
        "source_6": "For a weekend at the Hollywood Bowl, this worked well overall. Check-in was smooth, and we were given a courtyard-facing room where we slept through the night without any highway rumble. We drove to Griffith Park in the morning and Santa Monica in the evening using the 101 without delays. The room looked freshly kept, towels fluffy, and the pool area had plenty of loungers and clean water. We ate on-site—tortilla soup and fish tacos—and the flavors hit the spot. With an AAA rate that included breakfast, the stay felt well-priced for what we used."
