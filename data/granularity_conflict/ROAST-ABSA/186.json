        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly to understand the why behind HTML structure. In the lesson on lists, we added both ul and ol, but the choice between them was glossed over. During the forms segment, we created a text input and a submit button, yet labels, name attributes, and basic validation were skipped. When semantic elements came up, section and article appeared briefly and then we went back to div without clarifying when each is appropriate. I kept pausing to look up differences like b vs strong and i vs em because the reasoning wasn’t spelled out.",
        "source_2": "I came in knowing zero HTML and finished the course with a simple three‑section profile page that I hosted on GitHub Pages. The modules are short, and each ends with a quick recap that made the sequence stick. I appreciated the steady pace and the way she says “type this with me”—I kept VS Code open and copied along, then refreshed the browser to see changes right away. Quizzes mirrored the examples (headings, links, images, semantic tags), so I wasn’t surprised by anything. This was an easy on‑ramp for me, and I’m signing up for the next course in the series.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on clarity here: Colleen repeats key ideas at just the right moments. When introducing emphasis, she contrasted b/strong and i/em with a quick accessibility note, then circled back in the next video to review it. She consistently names files index.html, keeps a clean folder structure, and shows the save‑refresh loop so beginners see cause and effect. The closed captions and on‑screen highlights made it simple to follow without rewinding much.",
        "source_4": "As someone who’s already built a few static pages, the course moved too slowly for me. Whole minutes are spent recapping the prior video, and the graded tasks were minimal—upload a single page with a few tags, no multi‑page project or feedback on structure. I expected a deeper dive into forms, tables, or responsive layout, but those topics are deferred. I ended up watching at 1.5x and still wished for more challenging checkpoints and a capstone assignment.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on consistency: in week 2 she stresses keeping style rules in a separate CSS file, but later demonstrates an inline style to change text color without flagging it as a quick exception. Earlier she uses section and header for structure, yet a later example wraps everything in nested divs, which muddles the message for a beginner. Even the image example alternates between alt text that describes function and alt that describes appearance, and the distinction isn’t called out."
