        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in May for a city break, and the location worked well for me. I took the airport express to Hauptbahnhof and hopped on the S‑Bahn; from the station it was a short walk with my carry‑on. The U‑Bahn entrance is basically at the corner, so I never waited long to get around town. I walked to the river in about 10 minutes and to a cluster of museums in roughly 20, then headed back to a room on the fifth floor that faced the courtyard. I slept with the window cracked and didn’t hear street noise. The corner café with the red umbrellas turned into my breakfast spot before heading out each day.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on location: if you’re using transit, this place is convenient. The U‑Bahn is around the corner and the S‑Bahn is a few minutes’ walk, so I could be at Alexanderplatz in about 12–15 minutes, Potsdamer Platz in roughly the same, and the airport in under an hour with one change. There’s a ticket machine at the station that takes cards, and I noticed multiple lines running every few minutes during rush hour. I didn’t need taxis at all.",
        "source_3": "Also on location, my experience was different: the “walking distance to everything” line felt optimistic. Brandenburg Gate took me close to 40 minutes on foot, and East Side Gallery needed two U‑Bahn changes. With a stroller and a suitcase, the nearest U‑Bahn exit was tricky—stairs only on the side closest to the hotel, and the lift was across a wide road with fast traffic. One evening a construction barrier closed the usual shortcut to the S‑Bahn, adding a 10‑minute detour.",
        "source_4": "I’m only commenting on noise: my room (214) faced the street near the raised S‑Bahn tracks, and the first trains rolled before 5 a.m. You hear the squeal as they brake at the station, plus a low rumble that comes and goes. On two mornings a delivery truck idled under the window around 6:15, and when the windows were shut, the sound dulled but was still noticeable. If you’re light‑sensitive, the streetlights outside also seeped around the curtains.",
        "source_5": "Only about breakfast: the corner spot with the red umbrellas became my routine. Weekdays it opened at 7:30, weekends a little later, and I had crusty rolls, soft‑boiled eggs, and a strong cappuccino for about €10–€12. The staff moved quickly but the line curled out the door by 8:45, so I went early. They accept cards, and there’s a couple of outdoor tables that catch morning sun. It was closed on a public holiday, which caught me out.",
        "source_6": "Four nights for a work trip in late August gave me a mixed picture overall. Check‑in was smooth and the room was tidy, but there’s no air conditioning; the provided fan helped, yet it stayed warm until after midnight with the window shut. Wi‑Fi speeds swung wildly—fine for email, shaky for video calls in the evening. The elevator is small, so I waited a few minutes during checkout rush. The area winds down early, and I walked 12–15 minutes to find dinner after 9 p.m. Getting back from a concert after 11 meant longer gaps on the U‑Bahn platform even though the station is close."
