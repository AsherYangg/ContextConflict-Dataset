        "source_1": "I bought this phone a month ago mainly for battery endurance. On my typical day—2 hours of YouTube, an hour of calls, Telegram and Gmail syncing, and 30 minutes of GPS—the battery goes from 100% at 7 a.m. to around 35–40% by 11 p.m. Screen-on time sits roughly at 6.5–7 hours. Overnight standby drops 2–3% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. The 33W brick takes it from 15% to 80% in about 28–30 minutes and a full top‑up completes in just over an hour.",
        "source_2": "I shoot lots of kid and pet photos, so shutter response matters to me. Daylight shots fire instantly, and burst mode captured about 20 frames in a couple of seconds. Indoors with the flash, the phone snaps right away without that awkward pause I’ve seen on older devices, and the preview is ready within a beat. Switching between the main lens and portrait mode is smooth, and focusing locks quickly on moving subjects. 1080p videos look steady, and tapping the shutter while recording grabs a photo without stutter.",
        "source_3": "I tested Wi‑Fi around my two‑story house with an aging router in the hallway. In the far bedroom where my laptop shows one bar, this phone still holds the connection and pulls 25–35 Mbps on a 100 Mbps line. It roams between 2.4 and 5 GHz without dropping my Spotify stream, and reconnection after walking out to the balcony takes a couple of seconds. Even at one bar, YouTube at 720p keeps playing without buffering. Hotspot also stayed stable for my tablet for a two‑hour Zoom call.",
        "source_4": "After the latest MIUI update (14.0.8), the interface feels snappy on the 90 Hz setting. With 6 GB RAM plus the 2 GB memory extension, it keeps WhatsApp, Instagram, Maps, and Chrome in memory without reloads, and RAM use hovers around 3–4 GB in the system panel. I toggled call recording in the Google dialer’s settings and the Record button appears during calls. The built‑in cleaner usually finds a few hundred megabytes at most; I haven’t seen those multi‑gigabyte cache spikes. No random “System loading” screens so far, and games like Asphalt 9 run for 30–40 minutes without frame dips.",
        "source_5": "I’ve had the phone for three weeks and it keeps tripping over routine tasks. The launcher occasionally shows “Loading…” for a few seconds before icons appear, and the app list stalls when I search. Streaming over mobile data stops every few minutes while my spouse’s phone on the same SIM plan keeps playing, and Wi‑Fi at one bar flips in and out until I move closer to the router. The camera hesitates when I fire the flash in a dim restaurant, and there’s a half‑second wait before the shot saves. The cleaner nags me about 1.8–2.2 GB of cache even when I’ve only opened Telegram and Chrome, and the RAM expansion toggle doesn’t change app reloads."
