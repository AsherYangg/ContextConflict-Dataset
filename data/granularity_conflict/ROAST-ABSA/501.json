        "source_1": "I buy the 12-pack so I can stash boxes at work and at home, and these fit perfectly into my Weight Watchers days because they’re one point each. The cake layer is light with a marshmallow bump in the middle and a thin chocolate shell; one with afternoon coffee keeps me from raiding the vending machine. I even keep a box in the freezer—ten seconds in the microwave gives the center a little melt without turning the cake soggy.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on texture only: the cake crumbles on the first bite and feels dusty, the marshmallow layer is more of a smear than a cushion, and the coating has a waxy snap that doesn’t melt cleanly on the tongue. Warming them slightly improves the give, but the mouthfeel stays chalky compared to the old version I remember.",
        "source_3": "This is about packaging and shipping. My case arrived with four boxes dented, and several trays had cookies flipped and flattened against the lid. The outer carton was thin with no padding, so the chocolate shells were scuffed and a few tops stuck to the plastic. If you’re buying these to bring intact to a potluck or to keep in a drawer, expect some cosmetic casualties.",
        "source_4": "From a points perspective, one cookie is easy to budget, but the portion is small enough that I end up grabbing a second, and sometimes a third, which defeats the plan. The sugar rush wears off quickly for me, and I’m hungry again in an hour. They’re handy for tracking, but satiety-wise they behave more like a quick candy fix than a snack that holds me through the afternoon.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the current batch tastes more artificial than I remember, and the size looks scaled down—two bites and it’s gone. After a couple of boxes, the lingering aftertaste put me off, and I couldn’t get my family interested. With a whole case in the pantry, I ended up bringing the rest to the office break room just to clear space.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on flavor: the chocolate is mild rather than dark, closer to a cocoa cake than a brownie, with a marshmallow center that adds a little spring and sweetness. Dunking them in cold milk softens the shell and brings out more chocolate, and they don’t come across as cloying that way. For a quick chocolate bite after dinner, one cookie scratches the itch."
