        "source_1": "The lectures cram a lot into each session—on average 35–45 minutes with dense slides that stack names, dates, and terminology back-to-back. I found myself pausing every few minutes to annotate and then rewinding to catch definitions I’d missed. The week 3 quiz gave 10 minutes for 20 multiple-choice questions, so I was racing through recall rather than thinking. I ended up rewatching the modules on early recording formats twice because the pace made it hard to retain the distinctions between shellac, lacquer, and magnetic tape.",
        "source_2": "I took the course mainly for the storytelling, and the instructor leans heavily on anecdotes—early label founders, studio mishaps, and the rise of multitrack—all woven into the lessons. The interview clip with the engineer who tracked a live jazz trio stuck with me, and the case study on Motown’s assembly-line approach to songwriting made the business context feel tangible. That said, the narrative sometimes drifts and I lost the sense of chronology, especially around the transition from analog to digital in the late 80s; I had to cross-check the timeline in the readings to keep the progression straight.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, it connects the history, technology, and business pieces in a way I could actually map onto current practices. Week 1 moves from wax cylinders to streaming platforms, and by week 5 we were drafting an artist rollout plan with a spreadsheet and a short essay. The capstone asked for a revenue projection and a distribution choice, and peer feedback flagged my assumptions about touring costs. I spent roughly 6–8 hours per week between videos and assignments, but the discussion board was quiet, so most of my questions went unanswered until office hours.",
        "source_4": "I enrolled for the business side and kept bumping into gaps. The royalties module leans on 2016 US figures and barely touches neighboring rights or collection societies outside North America. The contract breakdown focuses on major-label deal terms, while indie distribution through aggregators like DistroKid or Bandcamp gets a cursory paragraph. In the final project, the grading rubric seemed heavily weighted toward slide polish, and my spreadsheet with split percentages received a single-line comment without any notes on assumptions or errors.",
        "source_5": "Coming in without a background, week 2’s technology lesson jumps straight into FFT, aliasing, and Nyquist without prep, and the lab asks for a VST plugin that only installs on Windows or macOS—I’m on Ubuntu, so I watched instead of doing. The DAW walkthrough assumes you know your way around buses and inserts, and the quiz leaned on memorizing release dates for landmark recordings. I finished the modules, but my notebook is mostly acronyms and timelines, and I still don’t feel confident routing signals in a DAW the way the lectures demonstrate.",
        "source_6": "I focused on the development-of-technology track and it’s packed with demonstrations: tape saturation comparisons, AD/DA converter bit-depth tests, and MIDI routing with a hardware synth. The instructor patches envelopes live and shows signal chains with diagrams that match the audio demos, which made it easier to link theory to sound. I replayed those segments a few times, though most hardware examples are US brands and there’s almost no mention of mobile production workflows or instruments outside Western traditions."
