        "source_1": "I took Dr. Chuck’s course over a month while commuting, watching two lectures each morning on the train and finishing the weekly quiz at night. The narrative threads—why the web is wired the way it is, where HTTP headers show up in real life—helped me tie the lessons together. The projects had me pulling data from a public API and cleaning it into a small CSV so I could plot it later; the auto-grader feedback nudged me when I missed edge cases. Even from across the ocean, I felt like a regular in the front row.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on the instructor: I didn’t submit a single assignment; I signed up just for the lectures. His habit of sketching URL paths on paper, walking through a curl request, then translating that into a few lines of code made the abstract parts click for me. The little asides—stories about early internet protocols and why capitalization matters in headers—broke up the heavy bits. I ended up rewatching the segment where he builds a regex and explains each bracket, purely for the clarity.",
        "source_3": "From an overall course perspective, I stalled out around week four. The sequence felt jumpy: one video revisits basic loops, the next jumps into scraping multi-page sites without much warm-up. Assignments that looked short took hours because the auto-grader flagged whitespace and newline differences I couldn’t see. Forum threads I found were two years old with no recent replies, and the “soft deadline” calendar kept shifting in my timezone, so I was never sure what was due when.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the teaching style: the lectures leaned heavily on long anecdotes before the code appears, which left me pausing to find where the actual example starts. The screen capture used a tiny font, and when he leaned toward the mic it clipped, so I kept toggling volume up and down. In the JSON section, the variable names changed mid-demo, and that inconsistency had me scrubbing back a few times to figure out which object he was referencing.",
        "source_5": "I came in for the course but bumped into delivery snags that colored the experience. Captions were a few seconds off in Module 2, so the transcript didn’t line up with the code being typed. The mobile app looped at 1.25x speed on my Android, forcing me to watch at 1x or 1.5x. Downloads hung at 99% unless I killed the app, and one quiz allowed only a single attempt with no practice version, which made timing out on a train ride pretty stressful.",
        "source_6": "Narrowly on assignments: the weekly programming checkpoints were short enough to fit into a lunch break, and the tests caught issues I normally miss—off-by-one mistakes when slicing strings, forgetting to strip trailing spaces before parsing. The email “mbox” mini-project taught me to build a frequency dictionary from scratch without leaning on pandas, and the grader’s hidden cases pushed me to handle empty lines and malformed records properly. I barely touched the discussion forum and still managed to pass the set by iterating on the feedback."
