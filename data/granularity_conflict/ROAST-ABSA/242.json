        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the readings, and they were the highlight for me. The syllabus pointed to the original PageRank paper, a clear explainer on Panda and Penguin, and a Search Central post that tied policy updates to real sites. I kept a notebook open and marked up the case study where a recipe blog recovered after a thin-content cleanup. The links felt curated rather than random, and I bookmarked several for my team’s onboarding doc.",
        "source_2": "Taking this as someone who manages SEO for a mid-size retailer, the course felt like a survey I could finish in an afternoon. The timeline of Google updates stopped short of the most recent core updates and didn’t touch Helpful Content changes or Core Web Vitals field data. Quizzes focused on definitions instead of decision-making, and there were no deep dives into log-file analysis, schema validation, or JavaScript rendering pitfalls. I came looking for tactics beyond what’s in public launch notes and didn’t find that depth.",
        "source_3": "I run a neighborhood bakery with a simple site, and the examples actually matched my world. The module that maps algorithm updates to small-business scenarios included a sandbox where I rewrote title tags for a one-page menu, and the feedback nudged me away from keyword stuffing. I don’t have a marketing team, so the way they explained crawling and indexing using storefront analogies clicked. I updated my Google Business Profile and adjusted internal links on my “Order Cakes” page right after the lesson.",
        "source_4": "I was excited about the reading list but ended up skimming a lot of it. Several links went to 2014–2016 posts, and the Panda/Penguin case focused on directory spam, which isn’t what I see in audits now. The PDF handouts had tiny fonts on mobile, so I had to switch to a laptop just to get through a two-page brief. I would have preferred fresher case studies, like how sites respond to AI Overviews or the most recent core update volatility.",
        "source_5": "As a newcomer, I used this course to orient myself over a weekend. The early lectures lay out crawling, indexing, and ranking, then anchor each concept to a chronological story of how search evolved. The short videos paired with end-of-module checklists made it easy to draft an audit plan for my handmade crafts site, from fixing duplicate titles to setting up Search Console. I walked away with a step-by-step sequence rather than a pile of disconnected tips."
