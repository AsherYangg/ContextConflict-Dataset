        "source_1": "I booked a Friday–Sunday stay for a quick city break. Check-in at 3 p.m. stretched to about 25 minutes because rooms were still being turned over. Our “deluxe king” on the 5th floor looked fresh at first, but the HVAC rattled overnight and the blackout curtains didn’t overlap, so sunrise lit the room at 6:10. The lounge had a nice buzz at 8 p.m., yet by 9:15 the small plates were gone and the bartender said the kitchen closes early on weekends. Breakfast at 8:30 felt like a scramble—no tables cleared, coffee urn empty twice, pancakes lukewarm. The team stayed polite and tried to fix things, but the weekend came off a bit patchy. On the upside, the metro entrance is two minutes away and the river walk took us about 12 minutes.",
        "source_2": "I didn’t stay overnight; I came in just for breakfast with my sister on a Tuesday. They seated us at 7 a.m. by the window. The buffet had made-to-order omelets, smoked salmon, still-warm croissants, and a honeycomb frame for the yogurt. Coffee arrived in a little carafe with automatic refills, and the server swapped my plate when I mentioned a nut allergy. Fruit tasted ripe—especially the pineapple—and the room stayed bright and calm. We paid 18€ each and left full.",
        "source_3": "I’m fussy about rooms, so here’s just that: Standard king, room 524. The mattress dipped on the right side, and the headboard creaked whenever I rolled over. Tram bells came through the window starting at 6 a.m., and the vent fan pulsed every few minutes. Closet space was fine and the rain shower had strong pressure, but I slept lightly both nights.",
        "source_4": "My focus was the people running the place. I arrived early at 10:30 a.m.; they tagged my bag and called me when a room opened at 12:15. The concierge marked a walking route on a paper map and circled a bakery that actually lived up to the hype. When a storm rolled in, the doorman handed me an umbrella without my asking. Housekeeping noticed two empty water bottles and left extras the next day. At checkout, a minibar sensor charge was reversed after a quick conversation. Every interaction felt human, not canned.",
        "source_5": "We booked three nights for our anniversary and barely left the property. Corner room on the 7th floor facing the park stayed quiet even on Saturday. The lounge became our living room—soft chairs, big windows, and a bartender who steered me to their rosemary gin infusion. Breakfast turned into a little ritual: omelet station, crisp bacon, tomato salad, and tiny lemon tarts that reappeared each morning. The front desk team remembered our names and got us a late table at Nora’s on short notice. Ten minutes on foot to the old town, and the tram stop sits right outside."
