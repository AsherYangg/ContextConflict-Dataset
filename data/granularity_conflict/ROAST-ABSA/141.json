        "source_1": "I bought the 1 lb Claxton fruitcake to set out with coffee, but the nuts were the weak point for me. Several pecan pieces felt soft instead of crisp, and a couple had that waxy, borderline rancid taste. The date code on the end flap read “SEP 21,” so not ancient, and I kept it at room temp in the pantry. Toasting a slice helped a little, but it didn’t fix the lack of crunch. The nut-to-fruit ratio also seemed lower than I remember from past holiday boxes, with a lot of smaller nut fragments rather than intact halves.",
        "source_2": "I focused on texture because that’s what makes or breaks a fruitcake for me. This loaf crumbled at the edges when I tried to cut it, and the fruit bits chewed more like firm gummies than tender fruit. The outer inch was noticeably drier than the center, which was dense and a touch pasty. I tried microwaving a slice for 10 seconds and drizzling a teaspoon of brandy to loosen it up—better, but still not what I’d call moist. I used a serrated bread knife and wiped between cuts, so it wasn’t a knife issue.",
        "source_3": "My box arrived with one corner crushed, and the inner wrap felt loose, not vacuum-tight. There was a sticky sheen on the paper liner, like some syrup had seeped out, and the loaf picked up a faint cardboard smell. It had been on a truck all day in 70-degree weather, so maybe heat played a role, but it definitely didn’t come across as “sealed-in goodness.” I had to rewrap it in plastic and chill it overnight just to get a clean slice, which isn’t what I expect from something advertised as ready to slice and serve.",
        "source_4": "I served the Claxton at a small office gathering, and it went over well as an all-around holiday treat. Slices held their shape, plenty of pecans throughout, and the fruit gave a nice color without the bitter citrus chunks my coworkers usually avoid. The box looked tidy, and the loaf smelled warmly spiced right out of the wrap. Paired nicely with black coffee, and there was enough density that thin slices satisfied without needing extra butter or jam.",
        "source_5": "I grew up on the old-style fruitcake loaded with citron and clove-heavy spice, so I was hoping for that classic bite. This one leans more sugary and nut-forward, with only a hint of spice, and I could barely detect any sharp citrus note. The texture is compact—almost candy-bar-like—so the flavors meld, but it misses that fragrant, slightly bitter citrus edge that I associate with traditional holiday loaves. I ended up grating a little orange zest over a slice to get closer to what I wanted.",
        "source_6": "“Ready to slice and serve” didn’t match my experience. At room temp, my chef’s knife kept gumming up, and the center dragged so the slices smeared rather than coming off clean. I had to freeze the loaf for 30 minutes and switch to a thin serrated knife to get presentable slices. Even then, I wiped the blade after each pass. Not a deal-breaker for me, but it did add prep steps when I was trying to plate dessert quickly."
