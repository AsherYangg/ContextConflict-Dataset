        "source_1": "I’ve been tracking the battery since unboxing in May, and it still gets me through a full workday without a mid-day top-up. My routine is about 1.5 hours of calls on WhatsApp, an hour of Google Maps with GPS, and a couple of hours of YouTube at around 50% brightness, and I usually end with 20–30% left by 10 p.m. AccuBattery estimates 94–96% health after roughly 120 charge cycles. Charging from 15% to 80% takes just under 40 minutes with the bundled adapter. The only time it drains faster is in weak-signal areas, which I can repeat consistently on my commute through a tunnel.",
        "source_2": "I bought it mainly for the camera, and that’s where it lets me down. Indoor shots of my kid’s birthday came out soft and blotchy, and the autofocus keeps hunting when the lighting isn’t perfect. Recording video has a bizarre glitch: a loud voice breaks in saying, “This call is now being recorded,” and the clip picks up that announcement and ruins the audio. 4K clips stutter when I pan, and the stabilization warps straight lines near the edges. I tried GCam ports, which helped with detail, but they crash randomly and miss the moment.",
        "source_3": "I use Android Auto every day in a 2019 VW Golf with an Anker Powerline II cable, and it’s solid. It connects within 5–10 seconds of plugging in, and I can run Google Maps, Spotify, and phone calls for a 90-minute commute without dropouts. After one OTA update I had to reset app permissions, but once I did that, it’s been stable again. No black screens, no random disconnects, and the steering wheel controls work as expected. Even voice commands for messages are recognized cleanly.",
        "source_4": "After a few weeks, the phone started to feel sluggish across the board. Opening the Camera or Dialer takes a couple of seconds, and scrolling Instagram stutters and drops frames in a way it didn’t on day one. The speaker and earpiece go silent at random—music pauses mid-song and calls occasionally turn into dead air until I toggle airplane mode. Twice the alarm didn’t make a sound in the morning even though the screen showed it was ringing. I factory reset and even had the service center reflash the software; the hiccups went away for a day, then returned once I installed my usual apps.",
        "source_5": "Between my family and me, we’ve owned a Redmi 9, a realme 7, and an MI A3 over the last few years, and they’ve held up better than expected. The Redmi 9 is on year three with a replaced charging port done under warranty in two days. The realme 7 gets monthly security patches and still runs all the usual apps without fuss; the only part we swapped was a worn-out case. The MI A3 had a finicky fingerprint reader at launch, but a software update fixed it, and the battery still lasts my dad through a day of calls and radio streaming. For the price brackets we shopped in, they’ve served reliably as daily drivers.",
        "source_6": "I grabbed this phone for travel and it’s been a steady companion overall. The interface stays smooth with a dozen apps open, and switching between Maps, Photos, and Chrome doesn’t cause any hiccups. Calls are clear on both ends, and the speaker is loud enough to hear podcasts while cooking without distortion. The camera does nicely in daylight—food shots and street scenes look crisp—and the shutter is responsive enough to catch moving subjects. I’ve had no trouble with Bluetooth in the car or with my earbuds, and notifications arrive promptly even with battery saver on."
