        "source_1": "I bought these alongside my usual raisins to compare texture. Ten pieces from this box weighed 8 grams versus 6 grams for the same count of raisins, and they kept their shape in hot oatmeal after a five-minute soak without turning mushy. The bite feels fuller, and when I toss them into granola they don’t get leathery or hard after baking; they stay plump in the finished clusters.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on sweetness: I measured two tablespoons into a basic cole slaw (cabbage, carrots, mayo, vinegar), and the sweetness pushed the dressing toward a candy-like vibe. In yogurt, a single handful made the whole cup taste like dessert rather than breakfast. I ended up cutting the portion by half and mixing with raw pumpkin seeds to keep the sugar level in check.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, the box I received had six 10-ounce bags, and two of the inner seals were partly open on arrival. One bag had clumped fruit with visible sugar crystals; another had scattered shriveled bits mixed with fuller pieces, so each handful was inconsistent. The sticky bits stuck to my teeth, and the drier ones were distracting in trail mix. I had to move the remaining bags into mason jars to keep them from drying out further.",
        "source_4": "I’ve been using these across the board—handfuls for snacking, a scoop into morning oatmeal, and a sprinkle over salads. The pieces are generously sized and lean sweeter than my store brand, which makes a nice foil for tart apples in a lunch bowl. One box stretched to about six weeks for me with daily use; the resealable pouches kept the fruit soft, and portioning 1/4-cup servings in small containers made it easy to grab and go.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on shelf life: I opened a bag and kept it clipped in the pantry with a food-safe desiccant, and within a week the outer edges felt tougher and a light sugar bloom appeared. Rehydrating a handful in warm water helped, but it lost that dense bite and turned patchy in texture. For long-term storage, I had to vacuum-seal smaller portions to keep them from drying out.",
        "source_6": "From a whole-product perspective, the pieces are noticeably plumper and sweeter than standard raisins, which worked in muffins but caused faster browning at 375°F; I reduced the added sugar by two tablespoons on the second batch to compensate. They’re sticky out of the bag and form clumps, so I break them up and dust with a touch of flour before baking. In cold cereal, they stay soft, but in a hot pan for pancakes they caramelize quickly and need a lower heat."
