        "source_1": "I signed up after hearing it was project-based, and it did spark a lot of ideas. I came in with no game dev background, but the weekly challenges nudged me to sketch a mechanic on paper, prototype in Godot, and collect peer feedback. Some weeks stretched me, yet the playful mini-missions kept me tinkering into the evening. By the end, I shipped a tiny two-level puzzle demo and filled a notebook with concepts to try next.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on structure and coverage. Week 1 introduces sprites clearly, but Week 2 suddenly jumps into physics formulas and collision layers without defining the terms. The assignment asks for a 3D scene even though all examples were 2D, and the rubric mentions “polish” without saying what that means. I spent hours hunting for prerequisites that weren’t linked, and I wasn’t sure if my submission matched expectations.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the course as a whole, I put in steady hours and didn’t see much growth. The videos repeated the same drag‑and‑drop steps, and forum responses were usually “try it again” with no pointers. I logged two or three hours nightly and still couldn’t explain why my character controller worked. The final project passed with a single line of feedback, and I left feeling like I was circling the same spot.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on the capstone project: I kept a dev log and iterated on one idea—a simple endless runner. The instructor’s checklist pushed me to refine hit boxes, tune jump arcs, and test with a friend each week. My first build barely moved; by week four the timing felt crisp and I could show a playable demo to classmates. As a newcomer, that week‑to‑week momentum was very noticeable.",
        "source_5": "Speaking just about the “fun” factor, the activities felt like chores. Most labs were long stretches of parameter tweaking with no theme or story to make the tasks engaging. The examples rarely invited experimentation; it was mostly “set gravity to X, set friction to Y.” I kept waiting for playful challenges or creative prompts, and they didn’t show up until the last module.",
        "source_6": "If you care about difficulty, the exercises lean very easy. I knocked out several during lunch by following the screenshots step by step. The starter templates already solved most bugs, leaving little to figure out. Even the final project could be finished by lightly re‑skinning the sample scene."
