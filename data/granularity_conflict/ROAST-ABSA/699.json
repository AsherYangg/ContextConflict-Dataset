        "source_1": "I booked three nights and mostly cared about breakfast since I leave early for sightseeing. Day one, the apple croissants were warm and flaky, with a hint of cinnamon, and they disappeared fast. Day two, the tray came out later and a few pieces were pale in the middle, like they needed more time in the oven. Day three, I showed up at 8:30 and the croissants were already gone; the staff offered packaged biscuits instead. The espresso machine did the job, though one morning the shot pulled weak until they refilled the hopper. If you rely on a consistent spread, plan on getting there right when service starts.",
        "source_2": "I stayed in an annex room on the third floor with my partner and felt immediately at home: polished floors, velvet chairs with carved wood arms, and a wardrobe that looked straight out of Ca’ Rezzonico. The room smelled fresh, no smudges on the mirror or stray hairs in the bathroom, and the bed linens were crisp. On the first night we heard footsteps above, mentioned it to the front desk, and by late afternoon the next day it was quiet. Walter sketched a walking route from Santa Lucia station that avoided the crowds, and it took us about 12 minutes with carry-ons. Breakfast set the tone in the mornings—apple croissants and strong coffee—and we spent the evenings admiring the canal from a little side bridge near the entrance.",
        "source_3": "I traveled solo with a large wheeled suitcase and wanted to avoid the vaporetto fare, so I walked from Santa Lucia. It’s not far on the map, but the route has multiple bridges—mine had three—and the steps plus cobblestones turned it into a workout. Street signs are small plaques at the corners, and I missed a turn into a narrow alley, adding ten minutes. Coming back at night, the lanes felt maze-like, and Google Maps lagged under the arcades. If you’re carrying heavy luggage or arriving after dark, factor in the bridges and wayfinding rather than just the straight-line distance.",
        "source_4": "I interacted with the front desk more than anything else. Walter checked me in around 2 p.m.; there was a short line, and it took about 20 minutes because he was handling two parties and giving directions. He loaned me a printed map, circled a quieter gelato spot, and offered to call the building owner about an upstairs noise that started around midnight. Sandro was on in the evening, arranged a last-minute museum entry for the next morning, and had extra pillows sent up. The noise wasn’t addressed that night, but I had a note in my door the following day letting me know they’d spoken with the upstairs neighbor.",
        "source_5": "My impression after a four-night stay was mixed. The annex stairwell is narrow and there’s no lift, so getting a mid-sized suitcase up two flights took real effort. The room looked gorgeous in photos, but in person the brocade headboard and gilded mirror felt a bit theatrical, and floor space was tight once we opened two carry-ons. Footsteps from above kept up past midnight on the first two nights; the front desk said they’d contact the owner, and it was quieter after we switched to an adjacent room for the last night. Breakfast was fine if you arrived early—by 9 the apple croissants were gone twice. The walk from the station is doable, yet hauling luggage over the bridges made me wish I’d just paid for the boat.",
        "source_6": "I’m particular about housekeeping, and a few details stood out. On arrival, the sink was spotless, but I found a couple of stray hairs near the shower drain and some dust along the top edge of the wardrobe. The grout by the faucet had a faint watermark line, and the floor under the desk picked up dirt on a tissue when I wiped. I left a note asking for a more thorough sweep; the next day the drain area was cleared and the dust on the wardrobe was gone, though the floor under the desk still had crumbs. Towels and sheets were replaced as expected, and the bathroom mirror stayed streak-free after that first day."
