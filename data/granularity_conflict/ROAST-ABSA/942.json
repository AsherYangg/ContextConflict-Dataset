        "source_1": "I took the European Business Law MOOC from Lund University on Coursera this spring. The first two weeks were a climb: terms like “subsidiarity” and “acquis communautaire” didn’t stick right away. I started pausing the lectures, reading the PDFs line by line, and replaying the case law examples. After that, the sequence of modules made sense—institutions, sources of law, then business regulations. The quizzes nudged me to revisit tricky points, and by the end I could follow CJEU judgments without getting lost. I’ve already enrolled in Doing Business in Europe to keep the momentum.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting only on the materials. I barely touched the forums and didn’t message instructors; my experience is entirely from the videos and readings. The lectures have accurate captions, the slides map out processes like company formation and cross‑border services, and the downloadable readings cite specific directives and cases. The transcript search let me jump straight to “freedom of establishment,” and the glossary cleared up abbreviations like TFEU vs TEU. Rewatching a couple segments helped me nail down unfamiliar phrases.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing strictly on scope. In the Fundamentals course, the syllabus tries to cover EU institutions, the legislative hierarchy, competition, consumer protection, VAT, and cross‑border contracting within a few hours per week. Topics spill past each other, and many sections give a single example before moving on. I was looking for deeper walkthroughs—like a step‑by‑step on how a directive is implemented in a member state—but the course jumps to the next area. The breadth made it hard to build a firm foundation.",
        "source_4": "I treated the MOOC as evening study around work. The weekly load felt dense; the video pacing stayed flat, so I found myself rewinding often to catch definitions. The discussion boards were quiet in my session, and questions about case applications lingered without replies. The quizzes allowed retries, but several questions asked for exact wording from the slides, turning study time into hunting for phrases rather than applying concepts. I finished Fundamentals but didn’t move on to the second course because I didn’t feel ready to use the material in my role.",
        "source_5": "I’m speaking only about assessments. The scenario‑based quizzes reference real cases and EU regulations, and a wrong choice triggers immediate feedback with a paragraph number from the reading. That breadcrumb trail made it easy to correct misunderstandings quickly. The peer‑graded assignment used a hypothetical cross‑border sale and required precise citations; the rubric spelled out how points were awarded, so I could see exactly where I slipped.",
        "source_6": "I’m focusing solely on breadth from the standpoint of someone with prior exposure to EU law. The way the course moves from institutions to competition policy and then to consumer rules mirrors how these areas interact in practice. Covering customs, VAT, company law, and cross‑border services helped me connect dots across my work. I didn’t need long deep dives; the quick overviews with references to directives were enough to orient me and point me to readings for further detail."
