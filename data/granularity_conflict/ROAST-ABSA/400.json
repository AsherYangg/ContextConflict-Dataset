        "source_1": "I’ve focused on battery because that’s what makes or breaks travel for me. With 5G on all day, Bluetooth earbuds, two hours of Spotify, an hour of Google Maps, and brightness at about 60%, I went from 100% at 6:30 a.m. to 22% at 10 p.m., showing 7 hours 40 minutes of screen-on in the battery stats. On a Saturday hike, I tracked GPS for 3 hours and took around 200 photos, and still didn’t reach for the charger until late evening.",
        "source_2": "I mainly care about the camera, and this one has treated me well. Daytime shots come out crisp with accurate colors, and Night mode has been surprisingly usable—handheld photos of neon signs and street art stayed sharp without that watercolor look. At a dim jazz bar, autofocus grabbed faces quickly and balanced the scene so highlights didn’t blow out; my old OnePlus 7T missed shots like that. Even after posting to Instagram, hair and fabric detail held up.",
        "source_3": "After three weeks as my daily device, it’s handled Slack, banking apps, and two email accounts smoothly. I’m seeing roughly 6.5–7.5 hours of screen-on over a 16-hour day, and a quick 30-minute top-up at lunch takes me from around 20% to over 60% with the included charger. Speakers are loud enough for podcasts on the counter, and the camera turns out clear vacation photos; in low light I just brace my elbows for steadier shots. I don’t bother carrying a power bank on office days.",
        "source_4": "Battery life falls off a cliff whenever I’m on the move. On a four-hour train ride with 5G, hotspot for my laptop, Bluetooth audio, and Maps pinging in the background, I went from 100% to 14% before arrival and the phone ran warm. Another travel day of video calls, Instagram, and photos had me hunting for an outlet after about five hours off the charger. If I don’t cap brightness or turn off location, it won’t make it through the afternoon.",
        "source_5": "I bought this hoping for a camera on par with recent OnePlus models, and I’ve been underwhelmed. Indoors under warm lights, portraits look soft and skin gets that waxy look; Night mode lengthens the exposure but fine textures smear, and there’s a tiny delay between tap and capture that ruins shots of my toddler. The rest of the package is fine—calls are clear and the screen is smooth—but I’m still packing a compact camera for dinners. Battery usually dips to 20% by early evening with about five to six hours of screen time, so I keep a cable in my bag.",
        "source_6": "Camera-only take: outdoors it’s serviceable, but after sunset the issues pile up. Street scenes show blotchy shadows, lamp posts bloom, and autofocus hunts before it locks on a face. In restaurants, moving subjects turn into ghost trails unless I brace against a chair; Night mode brightens things yet wipes out texture in hair and clothing. Switching to 2x makes the noise pattern even more obvious."
