        "source_1": "I read on my phone for hours, and the display has been rock steady. Adaptive brightness ramps up under midday sun and doesn’t dip randomly; indoors it settles around 30% without going murky. No blackouts during long YouTube sessions in picture-in-picture, and the panel stays evenly lit when I toggle between Chrome, Kindle, and maps. Even after a two-hour train ride with auto-rotate on, the screen never suddenly went dark.",
        "source_2": "I loaded my usual toolkit—banking, Slack, Maps, Instagram, and a custom launcher—and the interface has been responsive. The app switcher pops up instantly, notifications expand without delay, and I haven’t seen a single “system UI” crash message. I’ve kept it running for 11 days straight with around 6 hours of screen time daily, juggling split-screen notes and video calls. The only blip was a brief hiccup when swapping wallpapers.",
        "source_3": "I bought this a few weeks ago and ran into trouble almost immediately. On day three the screen went black mid-chat and only came back after a forced restart. I’ve had the “System UI isn’t responding” dialog show up multiple times, and safe mode plus clearing caches didn’t stop the freezes. I updated every app and still ended up rebooting about four times this month. The camera does capture crisp shots at family dinners, but the repeated crashes turned even simple tasks into a chore.",
        "source_4": "I mainly use my phone as a pocket camera, and it shines there. Low-light photos from my living room keep detail in faces without blowing out lamps, and 4K60 video stayed locked on my dog sprinting across the yard. Portrait mode separates hair strands better than my last phone, and the ultrawide keeps straight lines from bending too much. I’m getting consistent results without diving into manual settings.",
        "source_5": "From a day-to-day usability angle, I haven’t had to babysit the device. Current uptime is 19 days with no forced reboots. I run navigation for an hour each morning while streaming music over Bluetooth, bounce between email and spreadsheets, and handle a few quick photos at lunch. It’s handled app updates overnight and wakes for alarms reliably; the only power cycle was for a new SIM.",
        "source_6": "As an everyday driver, it’s treated me well. Calls are clear on the subway platform, the screen stays readable in afternoon sun, and gesture navigation behaves consistently. I installed about 60 apps, keep auto-updates on, and move between banking, rideshare, and video without hiccups. Setup did stall once on the first day, but a retry completed and it’s been smooth since."
