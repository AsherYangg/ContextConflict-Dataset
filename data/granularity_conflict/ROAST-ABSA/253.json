        "source_1": "I go through the single-serve pop-chips bags during my afternoon commute, and the seasoning feels balanced enough that I finish a pouch without needing a drink. The barbecue comes across as gentle smoke with a little sweetness, and the sour cream version reads as mellow onion rather than punchy. Texture-wise they’re light and crisp, and across a variety pack I haven’t run into any bag that felt heavy-handed on salt.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on salt: after opening three different bags from a 12-pack, the salt stands out more than the potato. Within a few minutes I’m reaching for water, and my fingertips end up coated with visible crystals. The label shows a moderate sodium number, but the taste skews sharper than that figure suggests, like the seasoning is front-loaded on the surface rather than mixed evenly.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the barbecue flavor: the rub starts sweet and smoky, but by the third chip the salt takes over and flattens the spice. I tried pairing it with plain hummus to soften the edge, and that helped a bit, but on its own the finishing bite is more saline than barbecue. I haven’t had the other flavors recently, so this is strictly about the barbecue bag.",
        "source_4": "Only about sour cream & onion: this one has a clean dairy tang with a soft chive note, and I can eat half a bag without feeling salty build-up on my tongue. It leans creamy rather than onion-powder harsh, and the seasoning reads measured instead of loud. For movie night, this is the flavor I reach for because it doesn’t crowd out everything else I’m sipping.",
        "source_5": "Taking the lineup as a whole, the chips feel airy and a bit restrained on flavor, almost like the base potato note is doing most of the work. I usually sprinkle a pinch of lemon pepper or dip them in Greek yogurt to get more pop. If salt is the concern, these taste closer to lightly seasoned crackers than a typical fried chip.",
        "source_6": "Across two boxes, I’ve noticed batch-to-batch swings: one sour cream bag came off as onion-heavy and sharp, while the next felt muted; a barbecue bag from the same sleeve had a strong salt blast but the following one was mild. The crunch is consistent, but the seasoning seems uneven, so it’s hard to make a single call on whether these skew salty or subtle."
