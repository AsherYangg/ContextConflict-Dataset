        "source_1": "Picked up this Samsung during a sale because it fit my budget and the spec sheet ticked the right boxes. Out of the box, the camera handled daylight and indoor shots well, and the fingerprint reader unlocked reliably. Before the first security patch (level 1), I’d end most days with around 25–30% left. After installing that patch last week, charging sessions on the stock 15W adapter warm the top-right of the phone, and by 7 p.m. I’m closer to 10%. The rest of the experience—calls, apps, and photos—hasn’t changed for me, so I’m keeping an eye out for the next update to see if it evens out.",
        "source_2": "I track battery pretty closely. My routine is light gaming, 2–3 hours of YouTube, constant WhatsApp, and Google Maps for school pickups. Pre–security patch level 1, I was seeing 6.5–7 hours of screen-on time with auto-brightness and 5G on. Right after the patch, it drops to around 4.5–5 hours, and the phone gets noticeably warm near the camera bump during a 25W charge. I tried safe mode, cleared cache, turned off Bluetooth, and switched back to the original 15W brick and cable—same pattern. No new apps were installed between those days; the dip lined up exactly with the patch.",
        "source_3": "I’m all about the camera, so that’s where I spent my weekend. Daylight photos are crisp, faces look natural, and HDR keeps the sky from blowing out in park shots. Indoors, the noise stays under control, and portrait mode separates subjects cleanly without cutting off hairlines. Video stabilization worked fine for a walk around the block, and the shutter fires fast enough to catch my kid jumping off a curb. I didn’t notice any change in behavior after the security patch level 1—focus speed and colors feel consistent with what I saw before.",
        "source_4": "My focus is on the fingerprint scanner. With a thin matte screen protector, it used to unlock on the first try most mornings. After the security patch level 1, I’m seeing more “press harder” prompts and two to three attempts before it accepts. I re-registered both thumbs, enabled the increased touch sensitivity setting, and cleaned the protector with isopropyl just to be sure. It’s reliable if I land squarely on the center, but any slight angle seems to throw it off. I haven’t changed any other settings, and this started right after the patch.",
        "source_5": "I updated to security patch level 1 the day it hit my phone, and I haven’t run into the charging heat others mention. I use a slower 10W brick with the original cable; charging overnight keeps it cool, and I wake up at 100% without a warm back. Through the day—email, Slack, 45 minutes of YouTube, Spotify on commute, and a few photos—I still finish with around 20–25%. The camera and fingerprint reader behave as expected, and the price felt right for what I get. Maybe the faster chargers are where the heat shows up; with my setup, the update hasn’t changed the daily rhythm."
