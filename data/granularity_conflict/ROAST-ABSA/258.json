        "source_1": "I finished the course in seven weeks while working full-time. The sequence from linear regression to neural networks felt coherent, and each quiz lined up with the lecture examples. I spent about 5–6 hours per week, mostly evenings, and the programming exercises pushed me just far enough without derailing my schedule. By the end I could explain gradient descent and regularization to my team and prototype a tiny predictor for a sales dataset.",
        "source_2": "Only commenting on workload. The weekly time estimate said 3–5 hours, but Week 3 and Week 5 took me closer to 10 because debugging vectorization in Octave ate up two nights. The autograder is strict about numerical tolerance, so tiny floating-point differences kept failing until I rewrote parts from scratch. If you’re juggling classes or a job, expect some weeks to balloon.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on presentation quality. The slides cram multiple equations onto one screen, and the notation switches between lowercase and uppercase theta without warning. Several derivations jump two steps at a time, so I kept pausing every minute to re-derive them on paper. Captions also drifted out of sync in a couple of videos, which made rewatching harder.",
        "source_4": "Taking the course as a whole, I came away with a checklist of algorithms but not much confidence for real projects. The programming uses Octave/MATLAB only, so I had to translate everything to Python afterward before it was useful at work. The datasets are toy-sized, and the section on model selection felt thin compared to what interviewers ask in 2025. The certificate looks nice, yet recruiters mostly asked about hands-on work rather than this line on my resume.",
        "source_5": "This is only about the instructor. Andrew speaks calmly and chooses relatable examples like predicting house prices, which helped at first, but the delivery stays at the same cadence for long stretches. I found myself nudging playback to 1.25x to stay engaged, and some anecdotes repeat across weeks. Office-hour style clarifications would have helped when questions stacked up.",
        "source_6": "Commenting on course construction. The assignments build on each other in a tidy ladder: cost function in Week 2, regularization in Week 3, then vectorized backprop later. Starter code isolates the math so I could focus on the algorithmic pieces instead of boilerplate, and the autograder feedback nudged me toward cleaner implementations. The forum threads linked to extra readings right when I needed them, which made the progression feel intentional."
