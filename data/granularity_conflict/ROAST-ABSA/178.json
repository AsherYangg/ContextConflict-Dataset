        "source_1": "I took Part 1 last fall and enrolled in this one right after. The sessions run about 6–8 minutes each, which made it easy to fit into my lab schedule, and the sequence from nanosensors to breath analysis felt like a proper roadmap rather than a pile of trivia. Prof. Hossaim Haick keeps linking concepts to real devices (e.g., wearable VOC monitors and cancer screening prototypes), so by the final week I had a shortlist of articles to share with my PI and a clearer idea for a nanosensor pitch in our group meeting.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor’s explanations: I struggled with how fast Prof. Hossaim Haick moves through dense slides. The font is small, several figures are packed with labels, and the auto-captions frequently miss technical terms—“self-assembled monolayers” and “chemiresistors” were mis-transcribed multiple times. I ended up rewinding almost every segment just to catch the definitions.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on coverage depth: the “overview” leans heavily on broad trends and market forecasts but rarely dives into mechanisms or derivations. There’s no walkthrough of fabrication steps, no math for sensor response models, and the reading list points to older review papers. Anyone already working in nanotech will find most of the material repeats what you’d pick up in a single seminar.",
        "source_4": "As an undergrad trying to decide between a materials or bio track, this tied a lot of loose threads together. The weekly structure kept me accountable, the forum responses came within a day when I asked about selectivity vs sensitivity trade-offs, and the future-prospects segment helped me frame a summer research proposal. I sent the link to two classmates who were lost in jargon before this.",
        "source_5": "Only about assessments: the quizzes hinge on wording quirks. One item marked “chemiresistor” wrong because the option said “chemoresistor,” and the final included a question on Langmuir isotherms that never showed up in the videos. No partial credit on multi-select questions means a single missed checkbox tanks the score even when the reasoning is mostly there.",
        "source_6": "Overall, I went in expecting a truly comprehensive tour and came away feeling like I’d watched a polished trailer. A lot of time is spent on where the field might go, with limited attention to how devices are actually built or validated. By the middle of week two I switched to reading a recent review article instead, since it gave me more technical substance in less time."
