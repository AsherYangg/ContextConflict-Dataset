        "source_1": "I bought this after seeing it featured on a cooking show and ran it through a few weeknight tests: marinara on Monday, cacio e pepe on Wednesday, and a chilled pasta salad for Friday lunch. I boiled it in well-salted water for about 9 minutes, then finished a minute in the sauce. The chew felt close to what I get from our usual semolina brand, it grabbed the sauce nicely, and the leftovers reheated without turning limp. It’s become an easy reach-in-the-pantry option for us.",
        "source_2": "Texture-only notes: I measured 6 quarts of water per pound with 1.5 tablespoons of salt, stirred every couple of minutes, and tested at 7, 8, 9, and 10 minutes. At 7–8 minutes the center stayed chalky while the surface softened; at 10 the outer layer started to fuzz and shed into the water. Even keeping the boil vigorous, I couldn’t dial in a consistent al dente across the pot.",
        "source_3": "Flavor-only observation: I did a side-by-side with a straight semolina spaghetti—first plain, then with just olive oil and pepper. This one carried a distinct bran-like aroma and a toasted, slightly bitter finish that lingered. My partner picked it out immediately in a blind forkful, so for us it didn’t pass as semolina in simple preparations.",
        "source_4": "Cooking behavior/firmness focus: I set a timer for 8 minutes, taste at 8:15, and pull at 8:30, reserving a splash of pasta water. With that routine, the strands stay springy, snap cleanly when bitten, and keep their structure after a few minutes in sauce. Even the next day, a quick reheat brings back a firm bite rather than a soggy bowl.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after multiple meals: I tried it with garlic shrimp, basil pesto, and a creamy mushroom sauce. Each time the bowl felt dense and the grain flavor pushed through, especially once the food cooled a bit. My teenagers noticed the change from our usual brand and picked around it, and I ended up giving the extra box to a neighbor.",
        "source_6": "One-criterion test—how “regular” it tastes to picky eaters: I served it with butter, parmesan, and a splash of the cooking water to two kids who usually reject whole wheat. Neither commented, and one asked for seconds. In saucy dishes it blended in for us, but in minimal sauces that wheat note popped more."
