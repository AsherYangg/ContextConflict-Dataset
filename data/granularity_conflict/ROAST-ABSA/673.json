        "source_1": "I track what I spend on pet food pretty closely, and this chicken-in-broth can adds up fast. At my local shop it runs about double per ounce compared to the supermarket brand I was using, and because it’s heavy on liquid I end up opening a second can or adding extra kibble to keep my 12 lb Maine Coon satisfied. After a month, my feeding budget jumped by about forty bucks, so I relegated this to “special dinner” nights instead of daily use.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about packaging because my cat had mouth irritation once from a cheap can liner. The Weruva case I got is clearly marked BPA-free on the lids and box, and the pull-tabs open cleanly without sharp edges. No weird metallic smell, and I can stash an opened can in the fridge overnight without flavor transfer. It’s one of the few foods where I feel comfortable with the can itself as much as the contents.",
        "source_3": "I switched during a heat wave when my tabby was turning her nose up at dry food, and this chicken in broth got her eating again. The meat looks like real shredded chicken instead of mystery mush, and the short ingredient list is easy to understand. She licks the bowl clean, stays better hydrated thanks to the extra liquid, and overall seems more interested in mealtime. I pay more than I used to, but she consistently picks this flavor over the other Weruva ones I’ve tried.",
        "source_4": "My guy treats it like soup—he laps up the broth and leaves a clump of stringy chicken behind. By late evening he’s pacing the kitchen because it didn’t keep him full. I tried mashing the shreds and mixing with his regular kibble, but he still ignores most of the meat. It works as a hydration booster when it’s hot, not as his main meal.",
        "source_5": "The texture varies a lot can to can. Some nights it’s fine shreds that mix easily, other nights it’s thick strands with tough bits that I have to snip with kitchen scissors. I found a small cartilage piece once, which made me double-check before serving. Compared to other “premium” foods we rotate, this one requires more prep than I’d like.",
        "source_6": "My senior cat needs a bit of fiber to stay regular, and this recipe is strictly chicken in broth—no grains, no vegetable bits. After a few days on it, he started straining, so I added a teaspoon of canned pumpkin to each serving to balance it out. With that tweak he does fine, but on its own it wasn’t enough for his digestive routine."
