        "source_1": "I switched to the Prescott after a nearby place couldn’t get me online for a client demo. The front desk handed me a wireless bridge and walked me through the setup; my laptop connected in under five minutes. Speed tests hovered around 85–95 Mbps down, uploads were steady, and I pushed a 1.2 GB file to our cloud without pauses. I ran two back-to-back Zoom trainings with screen share and didn’t see dropped frames. My phone showed 4 bars near the window and 3 by the bathroom, which handled dozens of texts and a handful of calls. I didn’t touch room service; I was there to get work done and the connection carried the load.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on food only: I landed late after meetings and wanted something small from room service. The menu in the binder had maybe half a dozen items—burger, Caesar salad, pasta, a couple of mains—and the kitchen cut off at 9:30 p.m. I called at 9:40 and was told cold options only. The downstairs restaurant quoted me a $32 pasta and a $28 chicken dish, and there wasn’t a lighter, lower-cost choice. Night two I tried again at 10 p.m. and got routed to delivery apps. For someone who relies on in-room dining after long days, the options felt narrow and the hours tight.",
        "source_3": "Three-night stay covering a conference: check-in was quick, and a staffer offered a wireless bridge without me having to ask. My laptop recognized it instantly, and I ran presentations from the room without buffering. Bedding and HVAC were fine, housekeeping kept the room in shape, and noise from the hallway stayed low. The pinch point was meals: room service shut down early, and the items available leaned toward $30-plus plates. I ended up walking 10–15 minutes to find more casual spots. If you plan ahead for food—grab snacks or map out takeout—the property works well for work-heavy trips.",
        "source_4": "Broad take: I didn’t rely on room service because the neighborhood had enough budget choices for me. There’s a deli two blocks over doing $12 sandwiches, a noodle shop on Bush with bowls under $15, and a food truck near the corner around lunch. I grabbed breakfast at a café at 7 a.m. without a wait. Back at the hotel, the wireless bridge kept my laptop stable for remote access into our ERP, and housekeeping refreshed towels daily. Front desk answered a couple of questions about printing and transit promptly. If you’re willing to step outside, eating didn’t feel like a stretch.",
        "source_5": "Narrow focus on room service from a light eater’s perspective: I only needed a late lunch and a quick dinner. The menu was short—club sandwich, Caesar, tomato soup, a few mains—but the sandwich and soup arrived in about 20 minutes, still hot, and the salad wasn’t overdressed. Portion sizes leaned generous, which made the limited selection workable for me. Prices for the mains hit the $30 mark, so I skipped those and supplemented with snacks I brought along. The kitchen closed earlier than I’m used to, but for mid-afternoon or early evening, the basics were available and straightforward.",
        "source_6": "I came in specifically to prep a demo and stress-test the connectivity. The tech at the desk loaned me a wireless bridge, and I measured 88 Mbps down / 22 up from the bed, a bit lower near the door. Streaming training videos and pushing code commits were smooth. The only hiccup was my cell phone: inside my room I saw 2–3 bars, and calls near the elevator sometimes clipped, so I took longer calls by the window where reception improved. Food-wise, I tried room service once and hit the early cutoff; the alternative was the lobby restaurant with $30-ish entrées, so I opted for a quick walk to grab takeout."
