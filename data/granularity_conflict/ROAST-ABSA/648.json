        "source_1": "I picked up this phone as a backup and the unit I received looked clean out of the box—no scuffs on the chassis, buttons felt firm, and the display was spotless. I set it up with calls, messages, and maps, plus a couple of banking apps. With that light load, everyday scrolling and typing felt smooth enough that I didn’t notice any hiccups. I plug it in around midnight and it’s full by the time I wake up, so the charging pace hasn’t really affected me in practice. The pre-applied screen shield on mine sat flat without bubbles, and I’ve left it on since day one.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on charging: I moved to this from a Vivo V20 Pro that shows a flash-charge icon the moment you plug it in. On this phone, that indicator never appears, and the difference is stark. From 20% to 100% with the included cable and brick takes about 2 hours 40 minutes on my desk, measured twice. Trying a 30W third‑party charger doesn’t change much; it sits around the same time, the phone feels slightly warm but not hot, and the percentage creeps up in single digits every 10–12 minutes. If I forget to plug in until the evening, I’m basically stuck waiting.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on performance after installing apps. Fresh setup felt fine, but after loading my usual stack—WhatsApp, Slack, Gmail, Outlook, Zoom, Instagram, two banking apps, and a handful of utilities—things started dragging. Opening the camera from the lock screen takes 3–5 seconds, switching between Chrome and WhatsApp stutters, and typing in long chats shows occasional input lag. Clearing cache and disabling a couple of auto-start apps helps for a few hours, then the jitter reappears. I didn’t see crashes, just a steady slowdown that wasn’t there on day one.",
        "source_4": "The only issue I had was with the transparent screen shield that came already applied. There was a small dent on the top right, like someone pressed a thumbnail into it, and that spot wouldn’t flatten even after cleaning. It caught lint and looked cloudy in bright light, so I peeled it off and used the phone bare. The display glass underneath was fine—no marks—and touch response improved once the shield was gone. The rest of the hardware, including the frame and ports, looked untouched.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks as my main device, my impression is shaped by two things: the pace slows once the app list grows, and charging feels like a waiting game. I went from a fresh install to about 30 apps, and animations started to judder when pulling down notifications or hopping between email and calendar. Battery top‑ups during lunch breaks barely moved the needle; from 35% to 60% took almost an hour on the stock charger. The handset itself looks well kept, and the pre‑applied shield on mine had a faint ripple near the earpiece that I eventually removed. I ended up switching back to my older Vivo V20 Pro for daily use, keeping this as a spare."
