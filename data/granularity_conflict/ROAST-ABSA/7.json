        "source_1": "I mostly judge a hotel by its mattress, and this one worked for me. I had a king on the 14th floor; the mattress felt medium-firm with a soft topper, and the pillows came in two lofts. I’m a side sleeper and didn’t wake up with a sore shoulder or lower back, which is rare for me. I slept through my 6 a.m. alarm both mornings, so I can’t comment on the view or the desk—just that the bed setup did its job.",
        "source_2": "My arrival at 3:30 p.m. on a Friday took longer than expected. The front desk line moved slowly, and after finally getting a key, it wouldn’t read the elevator sensor, so I went back twice before it worked. The agents were juggling phone calls and in-person guests, and the bell staff kept redirecting me to the desk for help. By the time I got into the room, I’d burned almost an hour I’d planned for dinner.",
        "source_3": "I care about views, so I emailed ahead and asked for a higher floor facing downtown. Ended up in 1708 with a wide window that looked over the skyline and hills, and I watched the sunrise wash over the buildings with a coffee from the lobby cafe. The glass was clean enough for good photos without glare. If a view matters, request an upper floor on the city side.",
        "source_4": "Came for a quick weekend and the standard queen felt more like a dorm layout—tight walkway around the bed and nowhere to open a full-size suitcase without blocking the door. My window stared straight into a parking garage, and the HVAC kicked on and off every few minutes through the night. The location made it easy to catch a show and grab late-night food, but after two nights I was ready to be elsewhere.",
        "source_5": "Four-night work trip and I had a smooth stay overall. Mobile check-in let me grab a key at a kiosk in under a minute, the room was refreshed daily with fresh towels, and I could walk to restaurants and a couple of theaters in about ten minutes. Wi‑Fi handled video calls without drops. Not a luxury place, but for what I paid it delivered what I needed, and I’d choose it again for this neighborhood.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on space: I paid a small upcharge at the desk for a corner king, and the difference was noticeable. There was a sectional, a full work desk with easy-to-reach outlets, and enough floor area to roll out a yoga mat without moving furniture. Two suitcases fit open side by side by the window. If square footage matters, the corner layout is worth asking about."
