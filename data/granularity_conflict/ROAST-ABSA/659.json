        "source_1": "I booked the package with dinner on the first night, expecting a proper meal. What arrived felt like “nouveau cuisine” as a caricature: three tiny courses with dainty plating, tepid sauces, and almost no seasoning. The fish course was the size of a matchbox, the beetroot foam collapsed before I tasted anything, and the dessert was two bites at best. I left the restaurant still hungry and ended up walking to a nearby takeaway. If you’re counting on that included dinner to get you through the evening, plan for a second stop.",
        "source_2": "Both mornings I hit the buffet right when it opened. Trays were piping hot, bacon crisp rather than limp, and the scrambled eggs tasted fresh instead of powdery. They had fruit that wasn’t tired, yogurt, pastries that flaked rather than dropped crumbs, and staff kept refilling without hovering. The coffee machines didn’t leave a queue, and I appreciated the option for poached eggs on request. Even with a decent crowd at 8 a.m., I found a clean table immediately. If breakfast is your priority, this setup made those early starts easy.",
        "source_3": "I was in town for meetings in the City, so the South Quay DLR stop being a few yards away mattered. I timed it: two minutes from lobby to platform, then a quick hop to Canary Wharf for the Jubilee line, or straight through to Bank in under 20 minutes. Walking back at night felt straightforward, well-lit with footbridges over the dock. There’s a small supermarket opposite for snacks, and I didn’t need a taxi at all. For anyone navigating London with luggage, that step-free access on the DLR beats wrestling with stairs.",
        "source_4": "My room on the 11th floor faced the docks, and I could trace the skyline from Greenwich round to Crystal Palace. The decor leaned modern—muted greys, brass lamps, and a headboard that didn’t wobble. The window ran almost wall to wall, so sunset actually felt like an event. Water pressure stayed consistent, outlets were exactly where a laptop user wants them, and the blackout curtains did their job against the dawn. I noticed the carpet was fresh rather than tired, and nothing rattled when the DLR rolled by.",
        "source_5": "For £179 I booked two nights with breakfast both days and dinner on the first evening, which suited a weekend visit. The room had a polished feel and that wide-angle view made downtime worthwhile. Mornings were easy thanks to a hearty buffet that didn’t run out of the good stuff. The dining room’s evening menu leaned into tiny portions and arty plating, not really my thing, so I supplemented later with a bite from a nearby spot. Between the price, the metro links at South Quay, and the comfortable setup, the stay worked well for me.",
        "source_6": "I picked the place because the package promised two breakfasts and a first-night dinner for £179, but that dinner colored the whole trip. After a day of travel, getting miniature courses with barely any taste felt like a bait-and-switch; I left the table unsatisfied and a bit irritated. The room’s view over the docks was handsome and the morning spread filled the plate, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that they blew it where it mattered most on arrival. With the station so close, finding alternatives was easy, and next time I’d book elsewhere."
