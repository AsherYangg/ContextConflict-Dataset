        "source_1": "I’m focusing just on flavor: the first bite gives off a warm, roasted aroma and a gentle nuttiness that reminds me of a thin layer of peanut butter. The sweetness sits low, so the taste doesn’t shout over coffee. I kept reaching for another because the flavor stayed balanced and didn’t turn cloying even after three cookies.",
        "source_2": "Zeroing in on texture, these run dry from edge to center. I wanted a firm rim and a soft middle, but each bite shed crumbs across my lap and the keyboard. Even a quick dunk didn’t change the chalky feel, and the center fractured instead of bending.",
        "source_3": "As an overall snack, these slot neatly into my afternoon tea routine. The subtle nutty profile pairs well with Earl Grey, and a brief dip gives me just enough give without falling apart. I went through a sleeve in two days and added another box to my next grocery order.",
        "source_4": "After finishing the pack, I’m not ordering again. The taste is fine, but the interior never loosens up—even with a long dunk in coffee—and I kept hoping for a softer core that didn’t show up. By the end, there were more crumbs in the tray than intact cookies.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on structure: they’re fragile. I packed two in a lunchbox and both arrived as clusters of shards; one even split in the wrapper. The crumble does make an easy topping for yogurt in the morning, but as a grab‑and‑go cookie, it creates a mess in the car.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on texture again, my batch had a crisp edge with a softer center, especially after a 10‑second microwave blast. I could split one to spread a bit of jam without it disintegrating, and it held together while I ate it on a walk. Whatever moisture level they hit here made the bite feel tender rather than powdery."
