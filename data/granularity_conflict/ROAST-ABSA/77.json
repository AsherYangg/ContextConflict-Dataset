        "source_1": "I’ve been making a mug right after dinner as a small treat. One packet with 8 oz of hot water gives me a cozy cocoa aroma without feeling heavy, and it fits easily into my calorie tracking. The powder melts in quickly with a spoon, and the result is smooth enough that I don’t feel like I’m missing out on dessert. It’s become my go-to evening snack when I want something warm and chocolatey.",
        "source_2": "Speaking strictly about flavor intensity: it’s on the faint side for me. With the recommended amount, the cocoa comes through, but it leans light and a bit thin; I need a second scoop to reach the deep chocolate taste I’m after. Doubling the powder fixes the taste, but now I’m basically having two servings.",
        "source_3": "I only care about the calorie math, and here’s what I noticed. The label looks friendly when you mix it with water, but as soon as I use 8–10 oz of 2% milk like I prefer, the calories jump fast. The serving size is also small, so keeping it “light” means a modest mug; a bigger cup that actually satisfies me turns into a different nutritional picture.",
        "source_4": "My experience is all about texture. The powder doesn’t fully dissolve unless I really work at it—stirring with a spoon leaves tiny clumps and a gritty finish near the bottom. Using a whisk or an electric frother helps, but that’s an extra step I wasn’t expecting for a simple cocoa.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, it’s a handy pantry staple for quick comfort. I keep the packets at work and make a mug during the afternoon slump; it’s fast, and the chocolate scent fills my office. On water it’s lighter and easy to sip; on milk it turns more dessert-like. Either way, it scratches the craving without derailing my day.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on sweetness: it leans sweet with a hint that reminds me of a sugar substitute. I get a lingering note on the back of my tongue that sticks around longer than the cocoa itself. Cutting it with extra hot water tones that down, but then the drink feels weaker."
