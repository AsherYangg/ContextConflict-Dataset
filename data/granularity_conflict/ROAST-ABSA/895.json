        "source_1": "I booked a long weekend and left feeling fuller than I expected. Check-in took under five minutes, the bell staff walked us to our room and pointed out where the pool towels and activity boards were. We ended up doing beach volleyball at 4 pm and sunset paddleboarding at 6:30—Francisco ran the trivia afterward and somehow got half the courtyard participating. Housekeeping brought extra pillows within ten minutes of my call, and the lobby café opening at 6 am meant I could grab a croissant and espresso before the gym.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the front desk here because that’s where my stay went sideways. I arrived at 3 pm and was told my room would be ready “within half an hour,” but it was 4:40 before I got a key. I asked about late checkout due to a flight at 7 pm and was told the policy couldn’t be adjusted, even for a fee. When I explained I needed hot water for medication, the desk directed me to the bar instead of sending up a kettle. I didn’t see anyone trying to problem-solve beyond reading policy lines.",
        "source_3": "I came mainly for the activities, so this stung. I signed up for archery at 10 am, salsa at 2 pm, and snorkeling at 4 pm. Archery was canceled on the spot due to “maintenance,” salsa started twenty minutes late and wrapped after twenty-five because the instructor had another class, and the snorkeling was changed to a beach walk because of waves. I get that safety matters, but the schedule felt shaky; I spent a lot of time waiting in the shade rather than doing what I came for.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take: the property has a lot on paper, but capacity seemed off. Every morning there was a queue for kayaks—my longest wait was forty minutes—and the tennis courts were booked solid after 3 pm. The live band in the courtyard went past 11:30, and in Building C the sound carried enough that I used earplugs. I asked to switch to a quieter room and was told the resort was full. Staff smiled and apologized a lot, yet the crowding kept nudging plans around.",
        "source_5": "I’m writing only about Francisco because he stood out. He walked the pool deck with a schedule sheet and learned people’s names. When he noticed my knee brace, he offered alternate moves during water aerobics so I could participate without pain. Later, he cobbled together a mini soccer game for six kids who wandered in late, adjusting the rules so they didn’t feel behind. That kind of attention is rare; my son still talks about “the coach” who actually listened.",
        "source_6": "Six nights here and I never felt compelled to leave the grounds. Mornings started with the bakery at 6 am, then the gym’s free weights and mats by 6:30. Midday we tried the climbing wall and rented bikes; evenings were cooking class for my partner and a mixology workshop for me. We counted twelve dining outlets on the map and sampled seven without repeating. The variety meant no scrambling to invent plans—the day sort of unfolded on its own."
