        "source_1": "I’m not picky about gourmet technique; I just need dinner on the table fast. These sole fillets fit that routine perfectly. I go straight from freezer to oven at 400°F, set a timer for 25 minutes, steam green beans while they bake, and dinner lands in under 40 minutes including preheat. The fillets release easily from the pan, and cleanup is one sheet of foil. For someone who normally reaches for takeout, the low-effort prep is the standout.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on texture: even when following the box directions (thawed in the fridge overnight, then baked at 375°F for 18–20 minutes), the fish came out soft to the point of falling apart. There was a noticeable puddle in the pan, and the fillets broke when I tried to plate them. Pan-searing after patting them very dry helped a bit, but out of the oven the flesh felt watery rather than flaky.",
        "source_3": "I served these for a small dinner party of four. Plated the fillets over lemony couscous with roasted asparagus, added a quick caper-parsley butter, and the whole spread looked restaurant-ready. No lingering smell in the kitchen, and the fish flaked in neat layers when cut with a fork. Guests asked if I’d spent the afternoon prepping; in reality I started about 45 minutes before they arrived and still had time to set the table.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on portions and packaging: the fillets in my box were all different sizes—two thin pieces that cooked in no time and one thicker piece that needed several extra minutes. One vacuum pouch had a weak seal, so there were ice crystals on the fish, and the corner of the outer bag tore when I opened it. Between the uneven sizing and the extra moisture, getting a consistent result across all pieces was tricky.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression after a handful of orders, this has become a weeknight staple in our house. I thaw the fillets during the day, dust them with a little flour, and sauté in olive oil for a light crust. Served with rice and a squeeze of lemon, the plate looks tidy and feels like a proper meal. The timing is predictable enough that I can start at 6:30 and have everyone eating by 7:10 without juggling a lot of steps.",
        "source_6": "On flavor alone: the fish itself is very mild. Out of the oven with only salt and pepper, it tasted flat to me, so I had to add a generous hit of lemon, fresh dill, and a drizzle of browned butter to wake it up. If you prefer bolder seasoning right from the package, plan on doctoring it; without extras, the taste leans delicate to the point of getting lost next to the side dishes."
