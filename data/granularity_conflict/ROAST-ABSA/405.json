        "source_1": "I bought this strictly for the taste and brew it as a pour-over: 1 level teaspoon to 12 oz of 200°F water, 20‑second bloom, then a slow 2‑minute pour. The cup lands squarely in the dark‑cocoa lane with a roasted‑grain backdrop, and there’s no bite on the finish. It leaves a faint chocolate aroma on the mug that reminds me of toasted cacao nibs, and it stays mellow even as it cools.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on flavor alone, I tried it three ways—auto‑drip, moka pot, and AeroPress. Even at 1 teaspoon per 10 oz, I get a sharp, woody bitterness that clings to the tongue, almost like over‑extracted espresso with an ashy edge. The aftertaste sticks around with a dry, astringent feel, and a splash of milk doesn’t fully tame it.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take: I swapped this in for late‑evening cups to avoid caffeine. My first try was a disaster—I used my usual 2 tablespoons for 12 oz and ended up with something close to syrup. Backed off to about 1 teaspoon, and that hits the mark for me. The kitchen smells like roasted cocoa when it brews, it blends nicely with oat milk for a faux latte, and I can sip it after 8 p.m. and actually sleep through the night. The bag lasts a long time since such a tiny dose does the job.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression after two weeks: I wanted a coffee stand‑in and this doesn’t quite land that role. At my normal ratio it turns thick and sludgy, and even when I cut it way down, the mouthfeel stays heavy. My French press mesh clogs with the fine particles, and cleanup is a chore. Without the caffeine, it doesn’t carry me through early meetings, so I’ve taken to blending a small pinch into regular coffee just to use it up.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the caffeine aspect only: I tried replacing my morning brew with this for five days. The flavor sits somewhere between cocoa and roasted barley, but there’s no lift—commute felt foggy, and I reached for a real coffee by 10 a.m. Doubling the scoop only intensified the taste without changing the way I felt, so as a wake‑up drink it misses what I need."
