        "source_1": "I signed up mainly for the content, and the examples were what kept me engaged. The lectures walk through email spam filtering, movie rating prediction, and handwritten digit recognition, and each topic ties the math to a concrete dataset. The gradient descent visualizations made it easy to see why certain updates work, and the short Octave demos matched the explanations without feeling like busywork. I ended up rerunning the provided cases with tweaks (like different learning rates and feature scaling) and could see the impact right away.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on how the instructor explains things, I struggled with the pacing of the derivations. Terms like “convex” and “Jacobian” pop up mid-sentence without much anchoring, and a few steps in the cost function derivations are skipped with “it’s straightforward” when they aren’t for me. I found myself pausing every minute to search definitions and rewatch segments, which broke the flow. Even when analogies were offered, they were brief, and I needed more connective tissue between formula, intuition, and code.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the course structure, the sequencing felt uneven. The first week is light, then weeks two and three stack quizzes and programming assignments so that everything bunches up around the same 48-hour window. The prerequisites (especially linear algebra basics) aren’t highlighted upfront, so I hit a wall during the regularization module. Discussion prompts and deadlines show in one timezone while the emails use another, and I missed a quiz because of that mismatch.",
        "source_4": "From an overall perspective, the course gave me enough grounding to build a small classifier to triage our support tickets at work. I did the lessons after my kids went to bed and finished in six weeks, and the weekly cadence didn’t clash with my schedule. The Q&A sections under each video answered most of my “why does the learning rate blow up here?” questions. I shared the link with two coworkers who were curious about getting into ML without jumping straight into heavy-duty libraries.",
        "source_5": "Sticking to content choices, the reliance on Octave/Matlab made the material feel dated for my workflow. I had to translate the assignments into Python to match our stack, and a lot of time went into bridging function names and plotting conventions rather than the concepts. The videos reference toolchains I don’t touch anymore, and there wasn’t a section that maps lessons to scikit-learn or modern deep learning frameworks. The emphasis on writing gradient descent from scratch is useful, but I expected more guidance on connecting that to current production practices.",
        "source_6": "Taking the course as a whole, I finished all quizzes and programming tasks but still hit gaps when I tried to explain things to my team. I could implement logistic regression, yet I mixed up softmax and one-vs-all in a meeting and had to read external blogs to sort it out. Regularization felt like a formula drop without a deeper sense of when it helps or hurts, and the bias–variance tradeoff got only a brief mention. The final week didn’t tie together the earlier pieces into a clear roadmap for tackling a new dataset, so I left uncertain about next steps."
