        "source_1": "I stayed three nights with my partner in early May and came away impressed with the whole operation. Our corner room on the 7th floor had wide windows facing the river, plenty of space for two suitcases to lie open, and a bathroom with a rainfall shower that actually held its temperature. The front desk greeted us by name after the first day, and the concierge squeezed us into a fully booked bistro around the corner. We added executive lounge access and used it every morning for a quiet breakfast—fresh berries, a couple of hot dishes, and a cappuccino machine that didn’t sputter out during the rush. The tram stop is a five-minute walk, and the museum district took us about ten minutes on foot. It poured one afternoon; the doorman handed us oversized umbrellas without blinking and told us to keep them as long as we needed. Check-out took under two minutes, and they stored our luggage until a late flight.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the executive lounge because that’s why I chose the hotel for a two-night work trip. I paid an extra €40 per night expecting a comfortable workspace and decent evening snacks. The reality: the “evening selection” was two cheeses, crackers, and olives; one night they briefly brought out a mini lasagna tray that was gone in ten minutes and never replenished. Coffee was fine, but the machine was out of milk one morning for almost an hour. The lounge was standing-room only from 6:30 to 8:00 pm, with kids doing homework at most tables, and staff started closing the service at 8:30 even though the card in the room said 10:00. Wi‑Fi speed was identical to the lobby. If you’re paying for access just for food and quiet, it doesn’t deliver.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on the room size and layout. I booked a “Superior Double” and was given 402, facing the inner courtyard. There was just enough space to walk around the bed; opening a large suitcase blocked the closet. The desk was so narrow that my 14‑inch laptop overhung the edge, and the chair couldn’t slide fully under because it hit the bed frame. In the bathroom, the shower was a tub combo with a clingy curtain, and there was nowhere to put toiletries except a tiny glass shelf above the sink. I asked about a larger room in the same category and was told they’re all roughly similar in footprint. If you like spreading out, this setup is tight.",
        "source_4": "I picked this place for location and found it less straightforward than the map suggests. The hotel sits off a busy roundabout; crossing to the river walk means waiting out long light cycles. The nearest metro station was a 12–15 minute uphill walk for me (with a carry‑on), and buses back after 11 pm were hit‑or‑miss, so I was relying on taxis. Cab drivers frequently circled due to one‑way streets, and it took 25 minutes to get back from the Old Town on a Friday night even though it’s only a couple of kilometers. Daytime access to offices nearby is fine, but for sightseeing or late dinners, the location slowed me down.",
        "source_5": "My comments are strictly about service. Check-in at 3 pm had one agent working with a line of six; when it was my turn, the process felt rushed and I left without basics like breakfast hours or Wi‑Fi details. Housekeeping skipped replenishing toiletries on the second day, and I called twice for extra towels that arrived after 40 minutes. I asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation and got pointed to a brochure rack instead of a conversation. When it started raining, the front desk said the umbrellas were “finished for today” and suggested the gift shop; only after I pressed did a bellman find a small folding one with a bent rib. The place runs, but it didn’t feel particularly attentive.",
        "source_6": "Two nights for a family wedding gave me a broad view of the property. The room was clean and the mattress felt supportive, but elevators were jammed before 9 am—twice I waited through four full cars—and breakfast looked like organized chaos with tables turning slowly and staff darting around. The lounge in the evening was packed enough that we took our drinks back to the room. The area worked for daytime errands, yet getting back after the reception meant a long taxi detour due to the one‑way grid. Staff did help us store the wedding cake in a back fridge, which I appreciated, though overall the experience didn’t quite match the glossy photos that sold me on booking."
