        "source_1": "I’m only commenting on charging. With the stock USB‑C brick, my unit jumps from 14% to around 80% in roughly 27 minutes, and a quick 10‑minute top‑up before heading out adds close to 20%. Even when I’m using Maps and Spotify while plugged in, the percentage still climbs steadily. Overnight I don’t leave it plugged in; a 20‑minute plug while making breakfast is enough to get me through the day.",
        "source_2": "After two weeks, I like how the camera handles daylight, and the phone refills fast during a coffee break, but mobile data keeps dropping on me. On my commute, the signal will show bars yet nothing loads until I toggle airplane mode or do a full restart. Twice, calls went silent mid‑conversation and only reconnected after a reboot. Wi‑Fi is fine, but stepping out of the house to mobile data is a coin toss, which makes navigation and messaging unreliable when I actually need them.",
        "source_3": "Focusing solely on connectivity: I run dual SIM (work and personal), and it’s been solid. Speed tests downtown hover around 120–150 Mbps and in my parking garage I still get 20–30 Mbps, enough for YouTube Music. Handoffs between my home Wi‑Fi and mobile data are smooth; I walk out the door and podcasts continue without a stutter. I’ve never had to restart to get data back, even after long flights in airplane mode.",
        "source_4": "This is just about the camera. Indoors, faces look a bit waxy and fine textures (like sweater fibers) smear when you zoom in. In dim restaurants, the shutter seems to hesitate, so moving subjects turn out soft. Night mode brightens the scene but adds a watercolor look around lights, and the focus tends to hunt on close‑up shots of food.",
        "source_5": "As an everyday device, it’s been dependable for me: Slack, email, banking, and calls all day, plus an hour of streaming on the train. Maps keeps a GPS lock on my weekend hikes, and I haven’t seen random signal drops on my carrier. Even after a 30‑minute gaming session, the back feels only slightly warm and cools quickly. By 10 p.m. I’m usually at 35–40%, and a brief plug‑in before bed tops it off for the next morning.",
        "source_6": "Only talking thermals here. The top half of the phone warms up while scrolling news or Instagram, and the heat spot is most noticeable near the camera bump. It’s not scalding, but the warmth shows up even when I’m just reading with brightness around 50%. I’ve limited background apps and still notice it, especially if I leave it on a soft surface like a couch."
