        "source_1": "I bought the 32‑oz bag of Italian Roast to compare with the grocery store’s 32‑oz house dark. At two tablespoons per 12‑oz mug, I’m getting about 30 mugs from each bag. That puts this one at roughly fifty cents a cup versus thirty‑five for the store brand. Brewing on a basic Mr. Coffee with the same filtered water, I ran them side by side for a week and didn’t notice enough difference in my morning cup to justify the higher per‑cup cost. If you’re tracking cost per mug like I do, that extra fifteen cents adds up fast.",
        "source_2": "I like a bold cup but I can’t stand oily beans that smear up my burr grinder. These beans look matte, not shiny, and after a week of daily grinding there was barely any residue on the burrs. With a Hario V60 at a 1:16 ratio and a total brew time around three minutes, the flavor comes through strong without that slick mouthfeel. It works well in a drip machine too; no oil film on the carafe and the filter doesn’t collapse, which happens to me with greasier roasts.",
        "source_3": "We’ve tried a bunch from this brand—Breakfast Blend, French Roast, Guatemala—and the Italian Roast is the one my spouse keeps asking for. Our routine is one pot on weekdays and a French press on Saturdays, and this fits both. It costs a little more than the store bag, but I treat it like the weekend pastry we pick up from the bakery: a small upgrade we actually notice. If you’re curious about a darker cup without that oily sheen, give it a try; it’s become our “company’s coming” coffee alongside biscotti.",
        "source_4": "I tested the Italian Roast on a Breville Barista Express: 18 g in, aiming for 36 g out in about 30 seconds. The beans are quite dry, and I kept getting channeling and a pale crema even after trying a finer grind and a WDT tool. As straight espresso it ran a bit sharp, while as pour‑over at 1:15 it settled into something more balanced. If you’re shopping for beans specifically to pull syrupy shots with a thick crema, this roast behaves more like a drip or press candidate than an espresso star in my setup.",
        "source_5": "I went the subscription route and got two bags a month apart. Both arrived with the valve feeling loose and no roast date printed, which makes it hard to gauge freshness. When I opened the second bag, the aroma was faint, and I had to bump from one to one‑and‑a‑half scoops per 10‑oz mug to get the strength I expected. For a bag that’s priced above what I see at the supermarket, I’m looking for consistent punch and better packaging; I ended up canceling and going back to the local roaster where I can see roast dates on the bin."
