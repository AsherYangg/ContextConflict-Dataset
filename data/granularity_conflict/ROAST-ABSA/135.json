        "source_1": "I booked this place just so I could walk to the Fleet Center/TD Garden for a show. From the front door, it took me nine minutes at an easy pace, with well-lit sidewalks and plenty of people around after the event. I skipped rideshares entirely—walked back with the crowd, grabbed a slice from the pizza spot on Causeway, and was in my room before the arena traffic even cleared. In the morning I jogged to the waterfront; it was about twelve minutes to the Greenway and another few to the harbor.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the room comfort here. My queen bed on the sixth floor sloped toward the middle, so I kept drifting inward during the night. The wall AC clicked and rattled every fifteen minutes and blew directly across the pillows, which woke me up a few times. The blackout curtains had a thumb-wide gap where the rod didn’t meet the wall, and a streetlight shone straight through. Pillows were very tall and dense; I woke with a stiff neck. Even the bathroom fan had a high whine that never settled.",
        "source_3": "Service interactions stood out to me. Marcus at the front desk greeted us by name after checking ID and drew walking routes to the Garden on a paper map, marking coffee spots that open before 7. We asked for extra towels at 10:40 pm; housekeeping knocked seven minutes later and handed over towels plus a couple of spare toiletries without us prompting. After checkout the concierge tagged our bags, gave us a claim stub, and when we returned in the afternoon, they spotted us and brought the luggage out before we reached the desk.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression from a weekend with my husband: the check-in line stretched to the lobby windows and took about 25 minutes, and our room faced the street so the post-concert crowd noise from the Garden carried until close to midnight. Walls felt thin; we could hear a neighbor’s TV and phone alerts. Elevators were packed and stopped on nearly every floor, which turned quick trips into long ones. We did walk to Faneuil Hall and the arena without needing a car, but the stop-and-go nights left us dragging during the day.",
        "source_5": "I stayed three nights for sightseeing and a concert. Mobile check-in worked, keys were ready when I arrived, and the room was clean with steady hot water and a shower that kept its temperature. The mattress felt supportive after long days on foot, and I slept through without hallway noise. The front desk suggested a quieter back route along the Greenway to the Garden, which helped us avoid the bar crowds. Breakfast next door opened early enough for our itinerary. I’d book the same place again."
