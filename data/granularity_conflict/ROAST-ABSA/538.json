        "source_1": "I completed the photography course on Coursera over four weeks, and the way the instructor broke down aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and histograms finally got me out of full auto. The weekly projects forced me to shoot at golden hour, then again in low light, and the side-by-side comparisons showed why my earlier shots looked muddy. By the third week I was nailing indoor portraits without motion blur, and my night cityscapes actually kept detail in the highlights. The pacing let me practice between lectures, and I finished feeling ready to take on the follow-up part.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the platform: on the Android app, the Week 3 “Exposure in Practice” video froze at 2:14 every time and wouldn’t cache for offline use. Playback randomly dropped to 144p even on home Wi‑Fi, captions ran about two seconds behind the audio, and the quiz spinner sat there until I refreshed and lost my answers. My peer‑review upload failed twice with a vague “network error,” and I had to re-export three JPEGs because the first batch got corrupted during submission. I ended up switching to a laptop browser just to get the module to register as complete.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on the assignments and feedback system. The histogram challenge had me bracket shots from −2 to +2 EV, then compare blinkies in camera versus what Lightroom showed; a peer pointed out blown detail in the bride’s veil and suggested spot metering on the highlights. Another reviewer circled a tilted horizon line on my pier photo and recommended using the grid and a smaller aperture for edge-to-edge sharpness. I re-shot the set two days later and could see cleaner detail in the gulls’ feathers and a straighter skyline, which made the notes feel directly actionable.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the course felt uneven: the first three modules repeated basics like the rule of thirds and leading lines, then the final week jumped into Lightroom sliders without much context. The audio had a faint crackle in several lessons, and the auto-generated captions mistranscribed “aperture” as “capture” more than once. Peer reviews varied wildly—one was a thoughtful paragraph, the next was a single sentence with no examples—so the grade didn’t reflect the effort put into the project. I finished the certificate, but I’m still looking for more structured critique before shooting paid gigs.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing to community and instructor presence: I posted detailed questions about back‑button focus and AF‑C tracking in the Week 2 forum, including my EXIF data and screenshots, and didn’t see an instructor reply. Peers chimed in days later with mixed advice, some of it contradicting the lecture notes. The scheduled live Q&A was at 3 a.m. in my time zone, and the recording went up without timestamps, so finding the segment on metering modes took forever. The discussions felt quiet compared to other Coursera classes I’ve taken.",
        "source_6": "I took a big‑picture view after finishing. The course nudged me to shoot four times a week, and the before/after album in my cloud drive shows better control of exposure and less reliance on auto ISO. The examples using street scenes and portraits made it clear when to choose shutter priority versus manual, and my camera settings no longer feel like guesswork. Even with a couple of hiccups on the site, I wrapped up in three weekends and signed up for the next part to keep the momentum."
