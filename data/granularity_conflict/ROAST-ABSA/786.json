        "source_1": "I took the full five-week sequence and found it packed with current research tied to classroom practice. The videos reference studies on reading comprehension interventions and the assignments asked me to adapt a writing prompt for a student with dyslexia, which I tested with my after-school group. The worksheets on syllable types and morphological analysis were clear enough that I shared them with two colleagues in our literacy lab. I appreciated the sections on building inclusive routines—things like predictable lesson structures and explicit feedback—to lower anxiety during reading and writing tasks. After finishing, I enrolled my support staff so we could use the same templates across our classes.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the module covering psychological and neurological aspects, and it leaned heavily on terminology without enough classroom anchors. There were segments on phonological processing, working memory limits, and dorsal vs. ventral streams with fMRI screenshots, but the narration moved fast and the graphs weren’t annotated in a way a teacher could translate into lesson steps. The quiz for this unit mixed clinical definitions with instructional scenarios, and several items felt like trick questions. I paused multiple times to look up terms outside the course, which slowed me down and made my notes messy. A few concrete case studies—like week-by-week changes in decoding accuracy for a specific student—would have helped bridge the gap.",
        "source_3": "The part on the English language’s evolution and orthographic opacity was exactly what I needed as a literacy coach. The instructor walked through examples like “though, through, thought” and contrasted etymological layers from Old English, Norse, and French, linking irregular spellings to predictable morphological families. A timeline broke down sound shifts and how they map to grapheme choices, and the downloadable chart made it easier to explain why “sign” and “signal” share meaning but not all sounds. I used the assignment to build a word wall by roots and affixes rather than just initial letters, which finally helped one fourth grader stop guessing at “rough” and “bought.” Parents responded well when I could trace a word’s history rather than just telling their kids to memorize.",
        "source_4": "I only cared about practical multisensory lesson planning, and this course delivered a structure I could lift straight into my classroom. The demonstrations showed letter tiles, finger tapping for syllables, and “sky-writing” for kinesthetic reinforcement, but the key piece was how to stage tasks to respect working memory capacity: shorter directions, chunked decoding, and spaced retrieval cycles. The planning templates prompted me to limit new graphemes to two per session, include a quick oral rehearsal, and end with a cumulative review that doesn’t overload the learner. I used the checklist to redesign my 30-minute small-group block, and my students actually completed all components without freezing on multi-step instructions. The accommodations list also helped me write clearer notes for IEP meetings.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled mainly for the assessments and resources, but several course logistics tripped me up. The auto-graded quizzes had ambiguous phrasing where two answer choices seemed correct depending on context, and the discussion forum in weeks 2–3 was quiet, so I couldn’t verify interpretations. A couple of linked readings sat behind journal paywalls, and the video transcripts missed jargon like “orthographic mapping,” which made searching notes harder. The peer-review assignment on lesson design gave wildly different feedback—one reviewer asked for clinical references, another wanted only classroom vignettes—so aligning to a rubric took guesswork. I ended up emailing the TA to clarify grading criteria after my second attempt.",
        "source_6": "Looking at the course as a whole, I expected more classroom footage and less lecture-style citation. The time estimate said 10–12 hours, but with the dense research sections and extra reading, my tracker hit nearly 20 before week four. Content repeated across modules—working memory limits and phonological awareness reappeared with similar slides—while practical segments felt shorter. The final reflective piece asked for detailed implementation evidence but the rubric was vague, and I couldn’t tell how much emphasis to place on data vs narrative. I paused the course midway and moved to a different training, keeping only the checklists for later use."
