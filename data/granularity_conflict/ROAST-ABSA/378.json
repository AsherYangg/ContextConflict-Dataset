    "question": "Summarize the following evidence in 2-3 sentences.",

        "source_1": "I enrolled for one reason: I wanted the professor to unpack sentence mechanics step by step. Instead, the lectures skimmed. In week 2 on clauses, we got two short examples and then moved on without touching dangling modifiers or parallelism. When he said “don’t worry about the jargon,” it usually meant the explanation stopped right there. I kept pausing the 8–10 minute videos hoping for a deeper breakdown—why a revision works, not just that it works—and ended up hunting for outside readings to fill the gaps.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing purely on the assignments here. The 200‑word cap sounded like a neat constraint, but in practice it sliced the heart out of my responses. I write long-form analyses, and cutting them down turned into a trimming exercise rather than a thinking exercise. The rubric awarded points for staying under the limit, while nuance took a back seat. Peer reviews required three quick checkboxes and a short note; most comments I got were generic (“nice use of active voice”), which didn’t help me revise. I would have preferred fewer prompts with space to develop an argument and more substantive feedback guidelines.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, this course fit neatly into my week. The videos were short enough to watch over lunch, and his energy kept me from zoning out after work. I started using the “subject–verb spine” check he teaches and immediately cleaned up a cluttered cover letter and a team email. The discussion board wasn’t noisy, but I could usually get a peer response within a day. The assignment where we described the same scene in exactly five sentences made me tighten my phrasing in blog posts and even social captions. I finished feeling more deliberate about every line I put on the page.",
        "source_4": "I came in hoping to apply the lessons to scientific writing. Most examples are pulled from fiction and film, and the exercises often revolve around narrative hooks and sensory detail. When I submitted a draft of a lab protocol for peer review, the feedback asked for “voice” and “mood,” which isn’t what I need for a grant appendix. The templates don’t translate cleanly to methods sections or SOPs, and the weekly prompts lean toward personal storytelling. If you’re drafting essays or memoir pieces, the material lines up; for technical documents, I spent a lot of time adapting ideas that didn’t quite fit.",
        "source_5": "From a whole‑course perspective, the production is slick—clear audio, clean slides, accurate captions—but the delivery style wore me out. The pace is brisk with lots of asides, and I kept dropping playback to 0.75x to catch examples. The metaphors (“pack your sentence like a backpack”) are memorable, yet they sometimes replaced the rule I was trying to grasp. Live Q&A snippets felt too short to tackle the tougher questions that showed up on the forum. I got value, but I also felt like the style was tuned for first‑time writers; with a few years of editing under my belt, I wanted more depth and less showmanship."
