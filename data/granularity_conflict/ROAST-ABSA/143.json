        "source_1": "I booked the Cancellor Hotel for part of our July honeymoon. At check-in the front desk congratulated us and sent up a chilled half-bottle of champagne with a small gift bag and a handwritten card. Our room on the 9th floor was compact—we stacked one suitcase on the luggage rack and slid the other under the desk—but the sheets were crisp and the bathroom felt freshly scrubbed. The building shows its age with a brass elevator and creaky floors, yet the staff mapped a walking route to the ferry and arranged a late checkout without fuss. We grabbed breakfast at Sears next door twice; the pancakes came out fast before our tours.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on room size only: in a standard queen, two of us couldn’t open both carry-ons at the same time. Clearance around the bed was about a foot and a half, the closet was so shallow I had to hang shirts sideways, and the bathroom door skimmed the toilet lid when it swung. With a stroller, we had to park it folded under the window to move around.",
        "source_3": "I judge hotels by housekeeping, and my room missed the mark. There was a dust line along the headboard, a long hair in the shower, and a coffee ring on the nightstand from a prior guest. The grout around the sink had dark spots, and a musty odor lingered near the window unit. I called downstairs and someone came up to wipe things down while I stepped out, but the smell was still there when I returned.",
        "source_4": "My stay was just one night, and I’m focusing on service: Reagan at the front desk gave two dinner options with a printed map, sent up foam pillows within ten minutes of my call, and the bellman flagged a cab in the rain while keeping my garment bag dry. When my key demagnetized, they reissued it immediately and offered to escort me back up.",
        "source_5": "For a weekend trip I chose the Cancellor for location, but the overall experience wore on me. The room felt tight, the AC unit rattled at night, and I could hear the neighbor’s TV through the wall along with delivery trucks before sunrise. The staff held a package for me and were polite, yet after two nights I felt more boxed in than rested. Sears next door was handy for a quick oatmeal at 7 a.m., then I headed straight out.",
        "source_6": "If you care about the building’s age, here’s what I noticed: single-pane windows that let in some street sounds, a radiator along the wall, mosaic tile in the bathroom with a few chips, and doors that need a tug to latch. The lobby has dark wood paneling and a vintage mail chute, and the light switches and thermostat are old-school rather than digital."
