        "source_1": "I’m picky about screens, and this one won me over. Text in ebooks looks etched, with crisp edges even at small font sizes, and there’s no grainy haze on white backgrounds. Outdoors at midday, I can read maps at around half brightness without squinting. Colors in films lean natural rather than neon, and dark mode is uniform with minimal glow in the corners. I switched off the “vivid” toggle in settings and the color balance still looks accurate for photo viewing.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on battery only: my routine is light—two hours of Spotify on Bluetooth, about an hour of calls, and periodic messaging/email. I consistently see around 6–7 hours of screen-on time, and I usually plug in at night with 20–30% left. Standby drain is modest; I lose roughly 3–4% overnight with Wi‑Fi on. Fast charging isn’t the quickest I’ve tried, but going from 20% to full takes about 90 minutes with the included charger.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday device, it covers the basics for me. I juggle WhatsApp, Outlook, and the calendar throughout a workday, and I rarely keep more than a couple of apps open at once. The screen is easy on the eyes for reading documents, and the camera is fine for scanning receipts or snapping whiteboard notes. I don’t game or run heavy design apps, and in that kind of light workflow I don’t run into hiccups that get in the way. If your usage looks like email, calls, and simple office tasks, it does the job.",
        "source_4": "I bought it expecting a 6GB phone to feel effortless, but under load it doesn’t hold up. After about a month, switching between half a dozen apps (Slack, Chrome tabs, Drive, music) triggers stutters, and I’m forced to clear the recent apps just to get things moving. “App not responding” pop-ups show up a few times a day when I push it, and games are a non-starter—15–20 minutes of PUBG leads to frame drops and a hot back panel. Battery also dips fast under that kind of use; I’ve seen 18–20% disappear in half an hour of gaming. For heavier multitasking or mobile gaming, it’s more of a struggle than I expected.",
        "source_5": "Camera-only impressions: in daylight, shots of street scenes look clean with decent detail, but indoor photos under warm lighting show a bit of blur unless I hold perfectly still. The autofocus sometimes hunts when photographing moving kids, and the shutter has a slight delay that makes action shots tricky. Evening photos pick up noise in shadow areas, and textures can look smudged at 2x digital zoom. The front camera is fine for video calls, though it softens skin more than I’d like. It’s workable for everyday snapshots, with clear strengths outdoors and trade-offs indoors.",
        "source_6": "On usability, the multitasking behavior gets in the way of my workflow. I keep Teams, Outlook, Notes, and Chrome (8–10 tabs) open, and the phone often reloads apps when I switch, losing my place in documents. I see “not responding” messages several times a day, and the keyboard occasionally freezes for a second or two when replying quickly. To get through the afternoon, I end up clearing all apps two or three times, which reduces lag for a bit but breaks the flow. A minor update didn’t change this pattern, and using fewer concurrent apps helps—but that’s not how I work."
