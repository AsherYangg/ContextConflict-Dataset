        "source_1": "I enrolled to fix recurring bottlenecks in my team’s analytics workflow, and the modules stack in a way that lets you act after each lesson. After week two, I used the root-cause tree from lesson 3 to diagnose a nightly ingestion failure; we reduced errors by switching the retry policy exactly as shown in the demo. The checklists and “do-this-next” segments made implementation straightforward. The instructor speaks in a clipped, command-like cadence, which felt odd at first, but by the second module I barely noticed. The capstone ties the pieces together, and the office-hours recording gave me the last nudge to roll the plan out at work.",
        "source_2": "I want to focus only on the grading system, because that’s what tripped me up. The rubric took off points for missing a specific filename pattern even though the analysis was correct, and a 30-second late upload dropped the assignment into a lower band with no wiggle room. Peer reviews required exactly three cited sources; adding a fourth line in my notes got flagged as “off-rubric.” Multi-part quiz items gave zero credit if one sub-answer was off, and resubmissions locked for seven days, which slowed my progress.",
        "source_3": "My sticking point was the instructor’s delivery. The cadence felt drill-like, with sentences snapped off as commands, and the written feedback used a lot of imperative phrasing and all-caps section headers. The examples themselves made sense, but the tone kept pulling my attention away from the material. By week two I was muting the videos and reading transcripts just to get through the content.",
        "source_4": "From start to finish, the course ran predictably and the evaluation felt aligned with what was taught. The rubric matched the sample solutions word for word; when I followed the provided template, the checklist scores lined up exactly. Turnaround on grades was under 24 hours, and peer feedback came with timestamped comments pointing to the lecture moments that justified each note. I appealed one item, got a response the same day, and the updated score appeared immediately.",
        "source_5": "I signed up specifically for actionable steps. The section on mapping stakeholder pain points to measurable metrics came with a worksheet I used in our next sprint planning; plugging in the SMART table clarified which KPIs to track. The churn case study walked through cohort analysis in a way I could mirror—after applying the retention calculation, our dashboard exposed an onboarding gap we hadn’t noticed. The “do-now” exercises at the end of each lesson made it easy to carry changes into my next workday."
