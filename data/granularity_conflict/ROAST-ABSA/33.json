        "source_1": "I picked up the 96-count Double Black Diamond box thinking bulk would lower my coffee budget. After doing the math, it comes to about 58¢ per cup for me, while the dark roast store brand at the warehouse club is 41¢. Shipping pushed it higher, and the big carton hogs a whole shelf. I’ll finish the box, but I won’t buy this size again unless the price drops.",
        "source_2": "I enjoy dark roast, but Double Black Diamond hits my tongue like char. On the K-Elite, even at the 10 oz setting it drinks overly smoky and leaves an ashy aftertaste. I tried a splash of half-and-half and switching to 8 oz for a stronger brew, and the sharp edge still sticks around. One cup is enough; I switch to something smoother after.",
        "source_3": "I keep a 96-count of Double Black Diamond in the pantry and brew it on Saturday mornings. The pods run strong without tasting thin, and the caffeine kick gets me through chores without a second mug. My K-Classic has never clogged with these, and the boxes last me about six weeks. With Subscribe & Save, the per-cup cost stays reasonable compared to buying smaller sleeves at the grocery store.",
        "source_4": "I’m reviewing only the 96-count packaging for Double Black Diamond. The outer carton is narrow enough to slide into my cabinet, and the inner sleeves keep the pods from rattling around. I can refill my countertop carousel twice and stash the rest neatly, which cuts down on reordering trips. For a small kitchen, this layout works.",
        "source_5": "I’ve gone through half the Double Black Diamond case and the quality feels uneven. About one in eight pods brews noticeably weak, and two burst at the seal and dumped grounds into my cup. The roast can taste fine on a good pod, but the inconsistency makes my morning routine unpredictable. I reached out to the seller for a replacement, yet I’m shopping around for a more reliable dark roast."
