        "source_1": "As someone who cooks with fresh truffles at work, I was hoping for that deep, lingering aroma. My bottle (lot L2311, best before 10/2026) hits hard on first sniff but turns one-note and perfumy on warm tagliatelle, then fades fast—exactly how truffle “aroma” oils behave. I tilted the bottle repeatedly and saw fine dark dust but no distinct shavings. A teaspoon on scrambled eggs left a slightly sharp, chemical edge that my partner noticed immediately.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing purely on availability: I put this on Subscribe & Save and had three months in a row canceled for “supplier delay.” The listing keeps flipping between in stock and “temporarily unavailable,” and the price swings by nearly ten bucks week to week. One order shipped from a third-party seller in the UK and took 12 days to arrive; I ended up emailing Truffle Hunters directly just to keep my kitchen stocked.",
        "source_3": "I’ve gone through three bottles now and keep a spare in the pantry. A light drizzle—about half a teaspoon—over mushroom risotto or soft-scrambled eggs gives a savory, foresty lift, and thin slivers settle at the bottom that I swirl back into suspension before pouring. Both recent orders arrived in two days, shrink-sealed under the black cap and wrapped in air pillows, no leaks. It’s become my finishing touch on roasted chicken and even buttered toast, and the flavor has been consistent across batches L2403 and L2409.",
        "source_4": "I tested this side by side with another truffle oil on popcorn and roasted potatoes. This one comes across like a strong fragrance: a couple of drops scented the whole kitchen, and the aftertaste veered plastic/metallic. On potatoes it steamrolled the butter and salt, and when I tried it in a mushroom cream sauce, the sharpness stuck to the palate. I don’t see the distinct truffle shards others mention—just a few specks that could be anything.",
        "source_5": "Ordering was a breeze—Prime next-day delivery, bottle taped at the cap, no leaks—but the contents underwhelmed. In a two-serving risotto I had to pour nearly a tablespoon to notice the truffle at all, and what came through was faint, like old olive oil with a hint of something earthy. My bottle’s best-by was only six months out, which makes me think I got older stock; even on fried eggs, the aroma disappeared the moment the heat hit the plate."
