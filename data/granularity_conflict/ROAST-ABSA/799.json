        "source_1": "I booked Catalonia Aragon with breakfast included and made a point to eat in the dining room all three mornings. By 8:30 a.m., the scrambled eggs sat in a watery tray, bacon had gone rubbery, and several pastries were already dry at the edges. The coffee came from a push-button machine and tasted burnt unless I diluted it with hot water. Staff were friendly when asked, but refills on fresh fruit took a long time, so people hovered around the buffet waiting for the next bowl to come out.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about cleanliness, so I did a quick sweep of the room when I arrived. There were long hairs in the shower drain, dust along the headboard, and a couple of mystery crumbs under the desk chair. Housekeeping swapped towels and made the bed the next day but missed the sticky ring on the nightstand and didn’t vacuum the corners—dust bunnies were still there when I checked out. It wasn’t a disaster, just not the spotless setup I expected for a short city stay.",
        "source_3": "My strongest impression was the front desk team at Catalonia Aragon. My suitcase didn’t make it from Paris, and the night clerk (Marta) called the airline, logged the claim number, and arranged delivery straight to my room the next morning. She even lent me a phone charger and handed me a small kit with a toothbrush and razor without me asking. When the bag arrived at 6:10 a.m., they kept it at reception and phoned my room so I didn’t miss it before heading to a meeting.",
        "source_4": "For a long weekend in Barcelona, the hotel worked well as a base. Check-in took two minutes, the room had USB ports by the bed and a decent desk, and the shower kept steady pressure. The breakfast spread had fresh-squeezed orange juice, a tortilla, and sliced jamón that disappeared fast, so I learned to go down before 8 a.m. The Gothic Quarter wasn’t a quick walk—it took me around 30 minutes including one metro transfer—but the Clot station made it simple to reach most sights. Between the smooth service and a quiet night’s sleep on the fifth floor, I added a Sunday night to my reservation.",
        "source_5": "I left with mixed feelings after three nights. Street-facing room 214 let in traffic noise past midnight, the AC unit rattled when cycling, and the mattress felt rigid enough that my shoulders ached each morning. The decor looked tired—laminate peeling on the wardrobe edge and scuffs along the skirting boards under the window—so the sleek photos online didn’t really match what I saw. On the flip side, the morning buffet kept me going for hours; I built pan con tomate with ripe tomatoes and olive oil and grabbed churros and fruit before heading out. After trying two rooms (214 and then 306), the second was quieter but still had the same firm bed and fluorescent overhead lighting.",
        "source_6": "I picked Catalonia Aragon because of location, and it delivered exactly what I wanted. It’s two minutes to Clot for both the metro and the R2 train, so I went from the hotel to the airport in about half an hour without a taxi. I walked to Sagrada Família in roughly 12 minutes and reached El Born in 25 at an easy pace. With cafés and a supermarket on the same block, I never felt out of the way or cut off from the center."
