        "source_1": "I toss the two-bar Walkers shortbread into my laptop bag most mornings. The individual wrappers keep the bars from turning to crumbs, even after the subway ride and getting jostled around. Mine arrived in a small box inside a bubble mailer, and every bar was intact with clean, easy-tear seals. For anyone throwing snacks into a lunch bag, the packaging does the job.",
        "source_2": "I bought the twin packs for my kid’s lunch, but the price gave me pause once I did the math. It worked out to noticeably more per ounce than the store-brand shortbread at our local market. Even with the convenience of the two-bar wrap, my grocery budget stretches further with alternatives. I only pick these up when there’s a sale.",
        "source_3": "As a longtime shortbread fan, I expected deep butter flavor and a tender crumble, but these tasted flat to me. The texture leaned dry and a little chalky, with a floury finish that lingered. The batch was within date, so I don’t think it was staleness—just not the rich profile I associate with this style.",
        "source_4": "I keep a box of the two-bar Walkers in the pantry for tea breaks. The portion feels just right: two fingers with a mellow butter aroma that pairs well with Earl Grey, and it keeps me from plowing through half a tin. The wrappers are tidy for the office, and my shipments have shown up without crumbs. For an imported treat, the cost seems fair enough that I reorder every few weeks.",
        "source_5": "I ordered two boxes for a small office gathering, and the experience missed the mark. Several bars arrived cracked despite the individual wraps, and opening a few left crumbs all over the conference table. The sweetness overwhelmed the butter notes, and a faint cardboard smell put a couple of coworkers off. I finished the meeting with a plate of fruit instead and shelved the rest.",
        "source_6": "I’ve been suggesting these to family because the two-bar packs solve the portion-control issue nicely. They tuck into lunchboxes without making a mess, and the bars hold up in transit on road trips. When friends ask for a dependable tea snack, this is the brand I point them to."
