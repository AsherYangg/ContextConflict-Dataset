        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on the battery. On a typical day I unplug at 7 a.m., run two SIMs with 4G on, stream about an hour of YouTube, two hours of WhatsApp calls, and an hour of GPS, and by 10 p.m. I’m still around 30–35%. Screen-on time averages just over 5 hours for me. Overnight standby drops 2–3% with Wi‑Fi and notifications active. Using the bundled 18W charger, I go from 15% to full in roughly two hours. The phone stays cool while trickle charging and doesn’t spike in temperature during long calls.",
        "source_2": "I’m commenting strictly on memory and performance. My unit is 4 GB RAM with “memory expansion” turned on, and after installing banking, Instagram, and a couple of delivery apps, switching between Chrome and WhatsApp forces reloads almost every time. The keyboard sometimes appears a beat late when replying, and background music from Spotify pauses when the camera opens. A 50 MB app from the Play Store takes close to a minute to install, which feels like slow storage. Light games run okay at first but start stuttering after 15–20 minutes, especially when notifications come in.",
        "source_3": "Only talking about the display here. Indoors the 6.5-inch HD+ panel is fine for reading news in Devanagari, but out in midday sun I have to cup my hand over the screen to read a message. Auto-brightness reacts slowly when stepping outside, and there’s a noticeable color shift when I tilt the phone off-axis. The bezels are a bit thick, which makes the device feel larger than it needs to be. Watching cricket highlights is enjoyable in a dim room, but subtitles wash out in bright environments.",
        "source_4": "This is my overall take after two weeks. I grabbed it during a sale for 6,999 INR for my father, popped in two SIMs, and calls have been steady in our small town with VoLTE active on both lines. The speaker is loud enough for hands-free chats, the rear camera produces usable shots in daylight, and the included case plus pre-applied screen protector meant no extra spend on day one. He uses WhatsApp, YouTube, and FM radio daily; the interface is straightforward enough that he didn’t ask for setup help after the first evening. For the price paid, it covers the basics without fuss.",
        "source_5": "My overall experience as a primary phone user was mixed. Out of the box there were multiple preinstalled apps I didn’t ask for, and I keep seeing promotional prompts in the notification shade even after disabling a few toggles. Callers say my voice is a bit muffled outdoors, and the microphone catches wind easily. The fingerprint reader misses one out of three tries with slightly damp fingers, and I’ve had two random reboots while tethering over Wi‑Fi. After a week I moved my SIM back to my older device because the small annoyances added up for my use.",
        "source_6": "Focusing only on cost and what comes with it. I paid 6,499 INR during a weekend offer, and the box included a charger, cable, clear case, and a thin screen film already applied, so I didn’t need to buy accessories. Local service center quoted 1,200 INR for a replacement display and 700 INR for a battery swap, which helps plan future expenses. Data usage is modest and the phone handles basic apps, so I skipped a higher data plan and saved there too. For someone watching every rupee, predictable running costs and not having to buy extras made a difference."
