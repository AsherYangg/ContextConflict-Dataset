        "source_1": "I used the hotel for a one-night stopover before flying to Australia. Check-in at the tower section went quickly and the corridor and lobby looked freshly kept. The front desk printed my boarding pass and pointed me to a quiet room on 7. The room itself was compact and tidy, mattress felt supportive, and the temperature control held steady through the night. I didn’t unpack much—just a change of clothes—since the wardrobe was tight with the safe and extra pillows inside. I managed a quick shower in the sit-in tub and was out for a 6 a.m. taxi. For a short overnight, it covered what I needed without fuss.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on lighting: I read in bed most nights, and this room made that tough. After sunset, the two wall fixtures by the headboard cast a warm glow but barely reached the page. The ceiling light was diffused and there was no focused desk lamp. I tried reading a paperback with 11–12 point text and had to move right under the sconce to make out smaller lines. Ended up propping my phone’s flashlight behind the book and still felt eye strain. Mornings were fine with daylight; evenings felt like a cave.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on wardrobe space: Traveling with a checked suitcase and a carry-on for an Australian trip, I needed to hang a few shirts and store a coat. The wardrobe in my tower room was shallow, with the safe and extra bedding taking up the lower half. After hanging two shirts and the coat, there wasn’t room for much else, so one suitcase stayed on the floor, narrowing the path from the bed to the door. I kept rotating items on the single shelf and used the luggage rack as a pseudo-closet, which made the room feel cluttered even though I was only there two nights.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on staff: Everyone I dealt with was on the ball. The night clerk noticed my oversized roller bag and offered to tag it for quick storage while I grabbed dinner. Housekeeping greeted me in the hallway and swapped my thin hanger set for a thicker batch within five minutes of asking. In the morning, the front desk arranged a taxi for 5:45 a.m., printed a map to the nearest pharmacy, and double-checked my flight terminal without me prompting. Small things, but they smoothed the whole stopover.",
        "source_5": "Overall view after two nights: The tower room looked neat on entry, but the layout felt tight once both bags were inside. The sit-in bath made showering awkward—the bottom wasn’t flat, so I had to angle my feet to keep balance, and the shower curtain kept brushing my elbow. Even with both lights on, the room stayed dim, so I switched to my e-reader at max brightness to get through a chapter. Surfaces and linens were spotless, and the lobby had a warm, open feel, yet I left wishing the room had a bit more breathing space and a brighter setup for evenings."
