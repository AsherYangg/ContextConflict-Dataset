        "source_1": "We spent a week at the Grand Bahia Principe and I left grinning. We were handed passionfruit drinks at check-in, and Carla at the desk moved us to a building closer to the beach path without any fuss. The sand was fine and pale, and we walked the shoreline from the little pier down to the rocky point every evening. Juan at the lobby bar remembered my partner’s drink after the first night and even made a cinnamon-rum coffee off-menu. The whole trip felt so right that we met the on-site coordinator and penciled in an April ceremony on the beach.",
        "source_2": "I came mainly to park myself on the beach, so here’s just that part: by 10 a.m., nearly every lounger was “reserved” with towels, and a lot of the frames were wobbly or cracked. The seaweed line sat in the surf until close to noon most days, and the shaded spots disappeared fast unless you slipped the attendant a tip. Music from the pool bar speakers bled onto the sand, which made reading tough. The view is postcard-worthy, but the comfort level on the beach didn’t match the scenery.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the people: the staff made our stay easy in a dozen small ways. Rosa from housekeeping noticed my fiancé’s asthma inhaler and swapped the scented toiletries for unscented without us asking. The towel hut guy greeted us by name by day two. At dinner, servers remembered my dairy restriction and steered me away from hidden butter sauces. When our key card demagnetized, a security guard walked us back and waited until we were inside. It felt like everyone was quietly looking out for us.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the place wore us down. We arrived at noon and stood in the check-in line for over an hour; the wristbands came fast, but the room wasn’t ready until nearly 3. The resort is massive, and the cart shuttles rarely matched the map—twice we watched one cruise past the stop without slowing, so we ended up hoofing it in the heat. At 8 p.m., the main buffet felt like airport traffic: we circled for 15 minutes before finding a table, and some stations sat empty. The beach looks like a brochure, but the daily logistics drained our energy.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on beach facilities because that’s my hobby: up by 7:30 a.m. each day and never had trouble grabbing two loungers under the palms near the water sports hut. The crew was out early raking the shoreline, so the entry felt clean by breakfast. The rinse showers by the path had solid pressure, and the volleyball nets were set up and busy every afternoon. A lifeguard even flagged a jellyfish patch and redirected swimmers—felt organized.",
        "source_6": "My take is only about service interactions. Asked housekeeping for extra towels around 5 p.m.; none arrived until after 10, and that was after two calls. At the quiet pool bar, whoever shouted loudest got served first, even if you’d been waiting. Reported a broken safe in the morning; the front desk said “after lunch,” but no one showed that day. No one snapped at us, but I never felt like our requests were on anyone’s list."
