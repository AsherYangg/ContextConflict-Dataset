        "source_1": "I mainly care about how fast it tops up, and this thing is a sprinter. With the in-box charger, I’ve gone from 18% to 81% in roughly 17–18 minutes before heading out for meetings. The phone gets slightly warm near the top during that burst, but not to the point where I feel like I need to take it off the case. On days packed with calls and maps, I can still end the evening with around a quarter left, and a 10-minute plug while brushing my teeth puts me back in the safe zone.",
        "source_2": "I bought it expecting that “108MP” tag to translate into crisp detail, and that hasn’t been my experience. Daylight shots look fine until I crop in—brick walls and tree leaves smear together, and small text on signs turns fuzzy. Indoors, skin tones skew a bit flat and edges lose definition, and the dedicated high-res mode takes longer to capture and often adds noise. Night scenes in particular lack the bite I thought I’d get from the sensor size, so I keep missing the texture I see on my older camera.",
        "source_3": "The hardware finish is what caught my eye first: the back resists fingerprints and the frame has a subtle sheen that looks clean under office lights. It sits comfortably in my hand, with a gentle curve that keeps it from digging into my palm during long calls. The buttons have a crisp click, and the camera bump doesn’t snag on my pocket when I slide it in. I’ve had coworkers ask what model it is purely because the exterior looks so put together.",
        "source_4": "Performance has been steady for me. I bounce between Slack, Gmail, Spotify, and Chrome all day, and none of them reload when I jump back in. Asphalt and Call of Duty run smoothly for half-hour sessions without stutters, and notifications stay timely even with battery saver on. App installs and updates finish quickly, and the keyboard pops up instantly without lag. Even after a week of use and 100GB of storage filled, it hasn’t slowed down.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks as my daily driver, it checks most of the boxes I care about: the finish looks sharp, the hand feel is comfortable, charging is insanely quick for a mid‑day top‑up, and the interface stays responsive no matter what I throw at it. The camera isn’t living up to the big number on the box, but for casual snaps and social posts, it does the job. Between commuting, streaming, and a bit of gaming, I haven’t once felt stranded near an outlet.",
        "source_6": "As a travel phone, this hasn’t worked out the way I hoped. The speed is great and the fast charging saves me when I forget to plug in, but the photos just don’t hold detail—street scenes from my weekend trip look mushy when I crop, and evening shots lose texture. Since pictures are my main reason to upgrade, the rest of the strengths can’t make up for it for my use. I’m keeping it as a backup, but I’ll reach for another device when I need reliable image quality."
