        "source_1": "I took the course for a broad overview and got exactly that: we moved from linear regression to decision trees, SVMs, and clustering, with each module pairing short lectures, a quiz, and a small notebook-based task. The instructor kept circling back to bias–variance and evaluation metrics, which helped tie the weeks together. I finished over five weeks at about 6–7 hours per week, mostly relying on the notebooks and built-in hints; I barely opened the discussion board.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on workload: most of my time went into reading scikit-learn documentation and troubleshooting. In week 2, GridSearchCV parameter names didn’t match what the notebook implied, and I spent an evening figuring out pipelines and ColumnTransformer syntax. Week 3 took around 10–12 hours because I had version mismatches in the hosted environment, and a kernel kept restarting during cross-validation. Forum threads on these issues sat for days, so I pieced together answers from docs and StackOverflow.",
        "source_3": "From a relatability standpoint, it felt like a sampler. I didn’t know whether to dive into NLP, computer vision, or tabular modeling, and the course laid out a tasting plate—classification one week, regression another, then clustering. The short labs let me touch each area just enough to decide my path; I ended up enrolling in a follow-up deep dive on text models the course recommended at the end.",
        "source_4": "Commenting only on the course’s general approach: it skims across many algorithms without dwelling. We went KNN to Naive Bayes in the same afternoon, using toy datasets like iris and digits. Logistic regression assumptions and scaling were name-dropped but not unpacked, and labs arrived with most code scaffolded. I left with a list of model names and formulas, yet still hesitated about when a tree would beat a linear model on a real problem.",
        "source_5": "Overall experience: as a career switcher, I fit it around evenings at roughly 4–5 hours per week. The labs ran in the browser, so I didn’t install anything locally. Assignments asked me to tweak hyperparameters, compare confusion matrices, and write a short rationale for model choice, which kept me engaged. I didn’t need the forums; the transcripts and inline comments in the notebooks answered what I needed.",
        "source_6": "On relatability to real work: my goal was to build a recommender and forecast churn, but the lectures leaned into math steps and clean examples. By week 3 we were deep in gradient updates and eigenvectors, while the datasets stayed preprocessed. My day-to-day has missing values, leaky features, and messy categories, and I couldn’t see a concrete path from the course notebooks to those kinds of pipelines."
