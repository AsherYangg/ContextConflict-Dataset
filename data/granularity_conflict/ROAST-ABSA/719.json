        "source_1": "I did a two-night stay at the Triton for a quick city break. Check-in took less than five minutes, and I was upstairs by 3:10 pm. Our queen room was compact with bright, quirky décor and a rubber duck waiting by the sink. We walked to the Chinatown gate in under three minutes and hit Union Square for window shopping right after. The sink drained slowly the first evening but cleared up by morning, and the water pressure stayed steady enough for my early meetings. With everything we wanted within walking distance, it served as an easy base for a short visit.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on room upkeep: my room (412) had plumbing issues from the moment I turned the shower on. The temperature swung from warm to almost cold every couple of minutes, and the faucet sputtered brown water for a second at first run. The toilet tank kept refilling through the night, and the wall AC unit rattled loudly whenever it cycled. Maintenance came up and adjusted the float, which helped briefly, but the refilling noise returned around 2 am. I also noticed peeling wallpaper near the tub and a sticky bathroom door handle.",
        "source_3": "I relied entirely on the concierge for dining and got exactly the kind of local guidance I needed. Nick printed a little list for us—Taylor Street Coffee Shop for breakfast, Ryoko for late-night sushi, and Le Colonial for a dressier dinner—and he actually called Le Colonial and secured a 7:30 reservation. He marked the walking routes on a map, all within about ten minutes on foot, and even suggested splitting our order at Ryoko to try more rolls. We followed his plan both nights and never had to open an app.",
        "source_4": "My experience was centered on finding food nearby after a late arrival, and it didn’t go smoothly. I got in around 9:50 pm on a Sunday, and within a five-minute radius most kitchens were already closed. The concierge desk had a small line; by the time I reached the front, I was handed a generic sheet and told “most places are done by now.” The only sit-down option left was a noisy bar with a limited menu, so I ended up grabbing a microwave burrito from a corner shop. If you expect to eat late without a plan, the immediate area felt thin on choices.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on location: I landed at SFO, took BART to Powell, and rolled my carry-on to the hotel in about 12 minutes at an easy pace. From the front door, it’s a three-minute walk to the cable car turntable, four minutes to the edge of Chinatown, and I reached the Ferry Building by foot in roughly 25 minutes for a morning meeting. The 1 California bus is a short walk away, so getting to the Embarcadero and back required no rideshares. For sightseeing and downtown errands, I didn’t need a car at all.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on price and what you get: my advertised rate was $159 for a standard queen, but the total hit $219 after taxes and a daily amenity fee. The room footprint was tight—once my suitcase was open at the foot of the bed, there wasn’t much space left to move. The dresser had scuffs, and the bathroom showed its age with a wobbly towel rack and a handle you have to jiggle. At that out-the-door total, I expected sturdier finishes or at least a mini-fridge; next time I’ll price out the larger chains around Union Square for comparison."
