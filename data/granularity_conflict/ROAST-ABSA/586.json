        "source_1": "I submitted Assignment 2 on March 3 and the platform said it needed three peer reviews before the score would post. By April 20 I still had only one review, even after I did my part and reviewed ten other submissions. The discussion board made it pretty clear our cohort was tiny that month. I couldn’t unlock the next graded task without that score, so my plan to roll straight into the capstone stalled. After nine weeks of waiting I re-enrolled in a later session and decided to skip the capstone altogether because I don’t want another multi‑month hold up.",
        "source_2": "I took the course in June while working full time and wrapped it up in about four weeks. The lectures were organized, the examples built nicely from basics to small projects, and the weekly prompts kept me on track. Grading never slowed me down—each peer review landed within a day or two, and the capstone feedback appeared over a long weekend. It might have been luck with an active cohort, but the pacing from submission to score fit my schedule without any bottlenecks.",
        "source_3": "My main issue wasn’t the speed, it was consistency. Project 1 came back as 68/100 with comments saying I didn’t include references, even though I attached a PDF with all sources. Another reviewer marked me down for using JSON outputs when the rubric clearly allowed either CSV or JSON. I used the “request additional reviews” option and two new evaluations pushed it up to 92. Turnaround was roughly five days each time, but the swing in scores made me question how uniformly the rubric is being applied.",
        "source_4": "I audited first to get a feel for the material and didn’t submit the peer‑graded pieces. Over two weekends I worked through Modules 1–4, built the mini ETL in the lab, and followed along with the pandas groupby and merge exercises. The auto‑graded quizzes returned instant results, and the walkthroughs were detailed enough that I could replicate them at work on Monday. I can’t speak to the peer review timelines, but the content flow and practice tasks were substantial on their own.",
        "source_5": "My experience was mixed: Modules 1–3 came back fast—typically 48–72 hours from submission to score—so I expected the same for the capstone. Instead, the capstone sat at 2/3 reviews for nearly two months. I reviewed 25 classmates to try to nudge the queue, posted in the forum, and opened a support ticket. Eventually staff switched it to instructor review and the result appeared on day 68. That long gap made it hard to plan when to finish the specialization badge."
