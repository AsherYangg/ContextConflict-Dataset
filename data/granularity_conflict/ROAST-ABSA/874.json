        "source_1": "I took this course as a 47-year-old career changer and ended up reshaping how I study and solve problems. The mentors on the forum responded to my questions about week 2’s case study within a day, and one of them annotated my draft with concrete pointers on framing my argument. The readings were laid out in a logical sequence with summaries at the end of each module, and the downloadable notes had space for my own annotations. By the time I hit the final project, I felt prepared rather than guessing at expectations.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the teaching support here. The “ask a mentor” thread looked active, but replies to my posts arrived three to four days later and often just quoted the syllabus line about “review the rubric,” which I had already done. Two live Q&A sessions were canceled last minute, and when they did happen, the hosts spent most of the time repeating what was already on the slides rather than working through our sticking points.",
        "source_3": "I can’t speak to the instructors much because I didn’t use the office hours, but the study materials were carefully assembled. The workbook came with 30 practice tasks and model responses, and each chapter had a one-page checklist that made revision straightforward. Diagrams were crisp, the references linked out to open-access articles, and the module PDFs printed to A4 without cutting off tables or figures.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the course felt more like a self-paced reading list than a guided class. The forums were noisy, with the same unanswered questions resurfacing every week, and the peer-graded assignments bounced between very lenient and oddly harsh without clear rationale. The slide decks looked tidy, but when I tried to apply the methods to the capstone, I ended up seeking help outside the platform because I couldn’t get timely direction.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the materials: several PDFs looked like scans, with faint text and small fonts that were rough on a tablet. Captions on the videos mangled technical terms (“Bayes” became “bays”), and in week 4 the formula sheet had two symbols swapped, which sent me down the wrong path until I rewatched the segment. The charts embedded in the notes pixelated when zoomed, making some labels unreadable.",
        "source_6": "Strictly about the tutors: they showed up in threads with targeted examples instead of generic quotes, and one of them scheduled Saturday office hours to accommodate Europe/Asia time zones. When I struggled to structure my week 3 analysis, an instructor mapped my outline to the rubric line by line and suggested a real-world case from healthcare to make it more concrete. Their follow-up a few days later checked whether the changes worked, which nudged me to iterate instead of abandoning the draft."
