        "source_1": "I only want to talk about the room temperature. I was put in 417 on the fourth floor, back side facing the inner courtyard. There was no air conditioning in that section, and the wall thermostat did nothing. At 10 pm my travel thermometer read 27°C, the small desk fan from reception just pushed warm air around, and the window safety latch only let it crack open a few centimeters. I ended up lying on top of the sheets, sipping bottled water all night, and woke up with a dry throat.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on the bedroom setup: my superior king on the third floor felt freshly updated. The AC held steady at 20°C without a loud hum, the mattress had firm support with a soft topper, and the blackout shade took the room to pitch-dark by 10 pm. I couldn’t hear hallway chatter or elevator dings, and the floor-level window gave a cozy, studio vibe once the sheer was drawn.",
        "source_3": "I’m giving an overall take after a Friday–Sunday visit. Check-in took under five minutes, and the front desk printed a city map and circled tram 4 for me. The location worked great for sightseeing—riverfront in one direction, the old square in the other—and I never needed a taxi. Breakfast both days had ripe fruit, crusty bread, and eggs made on the spot, plus a barista-style coffee machine that didn’t queue up. My room had functioning AC and those low-sill windows everyone mentions; not an issue for me since the sheer curtain allowed daylight without losing privacy. I left feeling the stay ran smoothly from start to finish.",
        "source_4": "Only addressing breakfast: I ate there twice around 8:45 am. The scrambled eggs were watery, bacon sat limp in a tray that didn’t feel hot, and the croissants crumbled like they’d been out since early morning. The coffee machine sputtered and poured a half cup on the first try, and I waited about ten minutes for someone to clear a table so I could sit down. I ended up grabbing yogurt and leaving.",
        "source_5": "Here’s my whole stay in one go. I was assigned a fourth-floor room at the back on night one, and it felt like walking into a greenhouse after a sunny day. Staff explained that wing doesn’t have AC and offered a move. The new room had air conditioning, but the windows were at shin level facing the street, which made me keep the curtains closed to avoid eye contact with passersby. Between the first night’s heat and the second room’s cave-like feel with the curtains drawn, I spent evenings reading in the lobby. The metro was a short walk and made meetings easy, but the sleep setup overshadowed everything else.",
        "source_6": "Just commenting on location. From the front door to the nearest tram stop took two minutes, and the airport bus stop was around the corner by the square. I walked to the riverside in under ten minutes after dinner. There’s a grocery across the street for water and snacks, plus a late-night kebab place that stayed open past midnight. Getting to the museum district and the conference center was straightforward without rideshares."
