        "source_1": "I’m not reviewing the effects here, just the subscription logistics. I take 2 tablets a day per my cardiologist, and the 120-count bottle lasts me exactly 60 days. I prefer to buy two bottles at once so I’m covered for four months, but the auto-delivery menu only offers 2 or 6 months. At 2 months I get boxes piling up; at 6 months I run out for a few weeks unless I remember to place a manual order. I tried skipping every other shipment, but I forget and end up with a mismatch between refills and lab visits. A 4‑month option—or a custom interval—would solve this. Until then, the planning is more fiddly than it needs to be.",
        "source_2": "I started these after my annual physical flagged LDL at 171. I took 1 tablet with breakfast and 1 with dinner, every day, and kept my diet the same. Ten weeks later, my labs showed LDL at 118. HDL stayed basically the same (53 before, 52 after), and triglycerides were within my usual range. No sleep issues or stomach trouble as long as I took them with food. My cardiologist reviewed the report and told me to continue the same routine and retest in three months. For anyone curious, I did not change exercise beyond my normal three 30‑minute walks per week.",
        "source_3": "Overall take after four months: it does what I bought it for, but there are trade-offs. My LDL went from 145 to 125 by month three. HDL nudged down slightly (50 to 48), which I’m monitoring. The capsules are on the larger side; I swallow them with yogurt and that prevents any throat scratchiness. No weird aftertaste. Shipping hasn’t been a headache for me—I set the plan to 6 months and bump the next delivery date forward in the app when I open my last bottle, which takes about two taps. Cost-wise, buying during periodic discounts helps. I keep my dose at 2 per day; any more and I get mild heartburn.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the HDL impact only. I began at LDL 160 / HDL 62. After eight weeks on 2 per day, LDL improved to 124 but HDL dropped to 45, which my doctor flagged. We don’t want the “good” number sliding that far. I’m trialing 1 tablet at night plus adding more cycling sessions and omega‑3s from food, then rechecking labs in six weeks. If HDL doesn’t stabilize, I’ll likely stop and switch tactics. I had no muscle aches or headaches, so tolerability wasn’t the issue here—just the HDL shift. Sharing this in case someone else is laser‑focused on that particular marker.",
        "source_5": "A note on what happens if you stop briefly. I ran out during a nine‑day work trip and missed every dose. I expected a big rebound, but my follow-up labs a week after returning showed LDL at 122 versus 120 before the trip, HDL 51 versus 52—basically unchanged for me. Maybe the effect lingers, or maybe my routine didn’t swing enough in that short window. Either way, a short pause didn’t move my numbers much. I still set a calendar reminder and keep a tiny pill case in my backpack now, but I’m less anxious if I forget for a couple of days."
