        "source_1": "I started keeping AriZona Peach Iced Tea Stix in my wallet when eating out. Most places give free water, so I stir in one stick and skip the $3–$4 soda or tea. Over a month of lunches, that switch shaved a noticeable chunk off my tab. The packets are light and discreet, and the math is simple: a stick costs me less than ordering a drink.",
        "source_2": "I was after a peach flavor that felt like brewed tea with a hint of fruit. Instead, the first sip came across like peach candy with a lingering sweetener twang that sticks to the tongue. I tried it again with extra ice to dull it, but the aftertaste hung around through the entire meal. My family picked up on the same note and asked what artificial flavor I used.",
        "source_3": "I keep a box in my desk at work and another in the glove compartment. The peach comes across as a gentle flavor, more like flavored tea than soda, and it blends cleanly in cold tap water after a few stirs. When eating at casual spots, I order water and make my own glass right at the table; servers haven’t minded as long as I’m not making a mess. For someone watching sugar, these help me avoid the usual fountain drinks without feeling like I’m missing out.",
        "source_4": "I bought the pack of six boxes thinking it would stretch over road trips, but the sticks are small and I often need two to flavor a 20‑oz bottle. Once I did that math, each bottle ended up costing close to what the gas station charges for ready‑made tea. For home use, brewing a pitcher with tea bags is cheaper by a mile. The convenience is there, but the value per serving didn’t match my expectations.",
        "source_5": "I’m picky about texture, so I tested a stick in room‑temperature water and in ice water. In both cases, some crystals floated around for a minute and a light sediment settled at the bottom unless I kept swirling. Using a shaker bottle solved it, but at a restaurant with a straw, I was chasing undissolved bits between sips. The flavor was fine once mixed, yet the effort felt fussy compared to dropping in a tea bag.",
        "source_6": "I tried these on a weeklong trip, using them at diners and airports. By day three, the peach note started to feel perfumey, and the sweetener left a sticky mouthfeel that made plain water more appealing. A couple of packets leaked powder into my purse, and since I needed doubles for larger cups, I went through boxes faster than planned. After factoring in the extra sticks and the flavor fatigue, I went back to ordering iced tea by the glass."
