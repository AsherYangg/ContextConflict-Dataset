        "source_1": "I buy these mainly for texture, and Bar Harbor nails it. The fillets slide out in solid planks, not ragged shreds. I mashed one with a fork into diced celery and a little mayo for sandwich filling and the pieces stayed meaty instead of turning to paste. I also warmed a few chunks in a skillet before folding into a potato hash; they kept their shape and forked cleanly with no mush or stringy bits.",
        "source_2": "My first can was a hassle: the pull tab snapped, and when I switched to a manual opener, oil crept around the rim and onto the counter. The smoky aroma took over the kitchen for a while. On crackers the fish itself had a gentle, clean finish and a firm bite, but the lingering smell had me cracking windows and running the fan. Even in the recycling bin the next day, the can still carried a whiff, so this won’t be a weeknight regular for me despite how nicely it eats.",
        "source_3": "Took a couple tins on a weekend hike and saved one for Sunday brunch. The fillets lift out tidy, and the seasoning doesn’t shout, which made them great on toasted English muffins with soft-scrambled eggs and a squeeze of lemon. On the trail I split a can with oatcakes and coffee and felt set for miles. The label notes they’re imported from Canada, and the smoke level played well in a chopped salad later without taking it over.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on taste: the smoke reads as a whisper and the salt sits low. In kedgeree with onions and rice it faded into the background, and alongside eggs I found myself adding extra salt and a squeeze of lemon to wake it up. If you’re after a bolder can that stands up on its own, this one stays on the shy side.",
        "source_5": "For quick lunches I keep a stash of tins, but this one feels spendy for the amount. My can had two slender fillets, one with a strip of skin, and I needed nearly the whole tin to top a single bowl of dill-and-potato salad. The fish is mild and firm, easy to flake over greens, yet between the portion size and the premium price, I’ll treat it as an occasional upgrade rather than something to stock by the case."
