        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in May and the hotel did a lot of the basics right. Check-in took under five minutes even though I arrived at 7 pm, and the receptionist handed me a city map with a few dinner suggestions circled. My sixth-floor room faced the tram line, but the windows kept it quiet enough to sleep. I walked to the cathedral in about eight minutes and the river in twelve. Housekeeping swapped towels daily and restocked the tea without me asking. The only part I didn’t gravitate toward was the lobby bar—low lights, soft music, and a pretty subdued crowd after 9 pm—so I mostly grabbed a nightcap elsewhere.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on location only: if you’re depending on public transit and walking, it’s less convenient than the website implies. With a carry-on and backpack, it took me 25 minutes to walk from the main station, mostly uphill. During my stay, the nearest metro stop was closed for renovation, and the replacement bus ran every 20–30 minutes late at night. Coming back from the riverside area after 11 pm meant a €16–€20 taxi each time. Fine if you’re taking cabs, not great if you planned on hopping trains.",
        "source_3": "Just about service: I arrived at 9:10 pm to find a short line at the desk, two agents chatting behind the counter, and one terminal in use. No greeting while we waited, and when it was finally my turn, the process felt rushed. I requested an extra blanket and a firm pillow; the blanket showed up after an hour and the pillow never did. When I asked about late checkout, I got a one-word answer and no alternatives like luggage storage or a day-use rate. It set the tone for the rest of my interactions there.",
        "source_4": "Only about room size: my corner king had more space than I expected. Two medium suitcases could stay open on the floor without blocking the path, and there was still room to roll out a yoga mat near the window. The built-in bench along the wall worked for overflow storage, and the wardrobe’s shelves were deep enough for a week’s worth of folded clothes. The bathroom had a walk-in shower with a wide drying area, so nothing felt cramped.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the lobby bar: Thursday night was buzzing. A local trio played from 8 to 10, the bartender offered a small tasting of regional gins, and we ended up sharing a high-top with a couple visiting from Berlin. Service was quick—drinks landed in under five minutes—and the place stayed lively until just after midnight without getting unbearably loud. It felt more like a neighborhood hangout than a hotel bar.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after a two-night business trip: the central address looked promising on the map, but the stay wore me down. My room had a faint musty smell when I opened the door, dust on the lampshades, and a shower that swung from lukewarm to hot at random. I could hear the neighbor’s TV until close to midnight, and the elevators were slow enough that I started timing them—over three minutes on two occasions. I tried the lobby bar once, waited ten minutes without anyone making eye contact, and left. Checkout the next morning added another fifteen minutes to the schedule because only one station was open."
