        "source_1": "I’ve been brewing this bag for two weeks and it’s become my morning and after-dinner routine. On a V60, 20 g to 320 g water at about 200°F, medium-fine on a Baratza Encore (setting 14), I get a cup that glides—no bite on the tongue and no stomach burn, which I usually get from darker supermarket blends. I even served it with tiramisu and the coffee accented the dessert instead of shouting over it. The buzz is steady enough that I can type emails after breakfast without shaky hands.",
        "source_2": "Taste-only take: in a Bonavita drip with a paper filter, 18 g to 300 g water at 195°F. I tried a longer 45-second bloom and a slower pour, but I kept getting a sharp, lemony edge and a bitterness that hangs on the finish. I ended up adding a splash of half-and-half to take the edge off. With a slice of cheesecake, the cup overwhelmed the dessert—felt like the coffee was the only thing I could taste.",
        "source_3": "My gripe is the grind fineness straight from the bag. In a basic Mr. Coffee basket, the bed turns to sludge and the paper filter creeps up the sides; I’ve had two messy overflows. In a French press, there’s a lot of silt at the bottom that sneaks into the last sips. I had to drop the dose to about 1.5 tablespoons per 6 ounces and stir very gently to avoid choking the flow. I’ll reserve judgment on flavor—the flow issues were the main headache.",
        "source_4": "As a daily driver, it’s a bit fussy for me. Using the same recipe on a Kalita 185 (22 g to 350 g at 202°F), I get one cup that’s silky and the next with a bitter tail, even when I keep my pour pattern consistent. That kind of swing isn’t ideal on busy mornings. When I served it with pancakes and maple syrup, my partner said the roast stuck out and clashed with the sweetness, so we switched to a milder bag for brunch.",
        "source_5": "Caffeine-wise, this hits harder than I expected. One 10-ounce mug at 8 a.m. had me tapping my foot through a 9:30 meeting and feeling wired past lunch. I’m usually fine with medium roasts, but here I cut back to a smaller scoop and still noticed a buzzing in my hands. Flavor was fine either way, but I have to treat it like an after-lunch cup or I’m wide-eyed into the evening."
