        "source_1": "I did a one-night stopover before a Pearl Harbor tour and ended up enjoying the stay more than expected. Checked into a high-floor room (21st) and opened the curtains to a sweep of ocean and city lights. The Expedia desk—Stacey and Agnes—sorted my tour tickets on the spot and even arranged an airport shuttle after 9 pm. The location made it easy to walk to the beach and grab dinner without fuss. They put out an early-bird complimentary breakfast that fit my tour schedule: coffee, yogurt, fruit, and pastries at dawn, so I could eat and make the pickup without scrambling.",
        "source_2": "I booked this place for the location and found it to be a mixed bag. It’s central, but that block stays loud late—buses, sirens, and bar crowds until around midnight, then delivery trucks before sunrise. The beach isn’t right downstairs; it took me 10–12 minutes weaving through shops and crosswalks to reach a swimmable stretch. Rideshare pickup was tricky because the curb is busy and drivers circle. If you’re hauling luggage or traveling with kids, the constant street noise and congestion around the entrance might be more of a trade-off than the map suggests.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing only on the view. I paid for an “ocean view” and from my mid-level floor I had a sliver of blue between two towers, with most of the sightline being rooftops and AC units. A construction crane blocked the sunset, and the balcony glass had a salt film that made photos look hazy even after I wiped it with a towel. The balcony was narrow, so sitting outside felt cramped. On Friday night I could hear fireworks but couldn’t actually see them because other buildings were in the way.",
        "source_4": "Just want to call out the service at the Expedia desk. I showed up around 7 pm hoping for a last-minute Pearl Harbor reservation, and Stacey and Agnes found timed-entry tickets for the next morning, printed everything, and booked a shuttle that matched my pickup. They gave me a simple checklist—leave the lobby by 5:20, bring ID, where to meet the driver—and a map to the nearest bus stop for backup. No upsell pressure, just clear answers and a calm attitude while the lobby was busy.",
        "source_5": "Only commenting on the breakfast. The “complimentary” offering is really a grab-and-go for tour departures: a small window around 5:30–6:30 am with coffee, juice, a banana, a mini muffin or pastry, and single-serve yogurt. No hot items, no seating, and by 6:10 a lot of the popular items were gone. When I came at 7:00 on a non-tour day, there was nothing set out, and the front desk pointed me to a paid café downstairs. If you’re expecting a sit-down spread, plan to buy breakfast elsewhere.",
        "source_6": "My two-night stay left me mixed overall. Check-in was quick, but the room that was billed as “new decor” felt inconsistent—fresh flooring paired with a dated vanity, a lamp with a wobbly switch, and an AC unit that rattled at low speed. Elevators took a while during peak hours. My “city view” faced an alley, so I kept the curtains shut most of the time. The address works for buses and convenience stores, though traffic noise seeped through the balcony door at night. The early-bird breakfast didn’t help since I wasn’t on a tour, and I passed on the activity desk pitch for add-ons. I’d probably choose a different spot next time."
