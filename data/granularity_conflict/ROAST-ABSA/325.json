        "source_1": "I keep a box of these sticks in my desk and another in the pantry. One packet in a 20 oz bottle gives a crisp, light finish without that syrupy feel. On weekends I split a bottle of sweetened white tea with blueberry, top it off with water and one stick, and the combo turns out bright and refreshing while still feeling lighter than soda. I’ve gone through two boxes already and plan to keep them in my rotation.",
        "source_2": "I bought these strictly for calorie control. Each stick shows 0 calories and 0 sugar, so swapping one for my usual 140–160 calorie bottled tea saves me roughly a hundred-plus calories per drink. I use two sticks a day during work, which nets me about a thousand calories shaved off per week without changing my meals. It’s been an easy replacement that doesn’t mess with my macro tracking.",
        "source_3": "Flavor-only note: mixed as directed (one stick to 16–20 oz water), the taste comes across sharp and lingers on my tongue for a while. I can smooth it out by either using 28–32 oz of water or blending it with a small pour of sweetened blueberry white tea, which softens the edges. Straight from the packet, though, it leaves a faint artificial echo that I notice for 20–30 minutes.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, this ended up being more effort than I wanted. If I follow the packet instructions, it turns out overly sweet; if I dilute enough to avoid that, the taste becomes thin and papery. I can get an okay result by mixing half-and-half with a sweetened blueberry white tea, but that defeats the quick “pour-and-go” idea I was after. After finishing the box, I’m going back to plain water with lemon and won’t be ordering more.",
        "source_5": "Single-aspect: mixability. The powder disappears fast even in ice-cold water, and I don’t get grit at the bottom of my bottle. It rinses clean without a film, and I haven’t seen any staining on my clear shaker. For quick gym refills, I can just dump, swirl twice, and start sipping.",
        "source_6": "Another angle on prep: I’ve hit several clumpy sticks in my box where the powder was caked and wouldn’t break up. I ended up cutting the packet open and mashing it with a spoon, and even then there were undissolved specks collecting at the bottom and a ring around the bottle. Maybe it was humidity during shipping, but it made on-the-go mixing a hassle."
