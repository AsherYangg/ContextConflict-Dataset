        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in early May and the location made getting around easy—Gran Via Metro is essentially at the doorstep, and I walked to Puerta del Sol and the Royal Palace in under 20 minutes. My room (601) had a small balcony facing Gran Via, just enough space to stand with a coffee and watch the flow of people; you can see straight down the boulevard. The mini-bar had water, juices, and a couple of beers included, and reception offered a welcome glass of cava when I checked in. Breakfast ran 7:00–10:30 with churros, Spanish tortilla, cold cuts, and a station making eggs to order. Staff said hello in the hallways and one front desk agent helped print my boarding pass. I booked after reading a lot of feedback and it matched what I expected, so I’d pick this place again.",
        "source_2": "I chose this place purely for location, so I’m sticking to that: being right on Gran Via and next to the Metro makes transit simple, but the street scene stays loud late. From my second-floor room, I could hear bus brakes and the occasional siren even with the window closed, and around 1 a.m. on a Tuesday there were still performers and crowds below. The upside is the subway entrance directly outside—Line 5 had me across town in minutes—and I didn’t need a cab for most sights.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on breakfast only: I went down around 8:45 a.m. both days. The buffet layout looked extensive, but trays of scrambled eggs and bacon sat empty for 10–15 minutes at a time, and the two coffee machines built up lines of six to eight people. Near 10 a.m., several items weren’t replenished. Labels were mostly in Spanish with tiny print, so I had to ask about allergens. I ended up with toast, yogurt, and fruit because the hot items weren’t ready when I was.",
        "source_4": "Service snapshot from my stay: Check-in at 2:30 p.m. was busy; the receptionist slid the registration form across without much explanation and I only learned breakfast hours and Wi‑Fi details after asking. I was given a drink voucher but no directions on where to redeem it. Later that night, a different front desk agent marked out a tapas route on a map and called a bar to check the wait, and housekeeping greeted me each morning in the corridor.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the “free mini-bar”: mine held two waters, one cola, one orange soda, and a small bag of chips. A price list tucked behind the door said spirits and most snacks were chargeable, with only soft drinks included. It wasn’t restocked after the first night; when I phoned down, they said refills are on request and delivered some bottles the next morning. The glass of cava is served at reception during specific hours—I arrived at 9 p.m. and had to come back the next day to get it.",
        "source_6": "About the room and balcony design: I booked a “double with balcony” but arrived late and was given an interior room facing a light well for the first night; they moved me the next day when a balcony room opened. The balcony itself was very narrow—standing room only—and from the fifth floor the view was mostly rooftops with a slice of Gran Via between buildings. With the door open you catch traffic noise; when shut, the seal and blackout curtains did a good job blocking sound and light."
