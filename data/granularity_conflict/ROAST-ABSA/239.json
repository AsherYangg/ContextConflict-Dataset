        "source_1": "I stayed for a long weekend in September. Check-in was quick. I booked a superior king on the 9th floor; the corner room had windows on two sides, a small sofa, and a wide desk, so my partner and I could spread out without bumping into suitcases. We went to the breakfast buffet twice; it ran about $26 per person with coffee and had an omelet station, smoked fish, fresh fruit, and pastries. It wasn’t cheap, but we left full and didn’t need lunch. The location made planning easy—rideshares arrived in under three minutes, and we walked five minutes to the waterfront. There’s a well-known seafood place next door; we slipped in at the bar for oysters and chowder after 9 pm and it hit the spot.",
        "source_2": "My take is only about the breakfast. I was down at 7:10 am both mornings and the hot items missed the mark: scrambled eggs were runny, bacon sat in a puddle of grease, and the pancakes were lukewarm. The coffee urn near the pastry station poured bitter, almost burnt-tasting cups; the server said the machine had been temperamental all week. Day two I grabbed a banana and headed to the café across the street instead.",
        "source_3": "We were a family of four, and the breakfast bill surprised me: $112 for the buffet with tip, and that was without any specialty drinks. The kids were charged the same as adults even though one only picked at a croissant. Fresh-squeezed juice and cappuccinos were extra, and there wasn’t a made-to-order option included unless you paid more. After that morning, we bought yogurt and fruit from the market around the corner.",
        "source_4": "I booked a “deluxe king” expecting plenty of room to work. The square footage on the website said roughly 320, but the layout made it feel tight: the platform bed stuck out inches from the mattress, the loveseat blocked part of the closet, and I could only open my carry-on on the floor by the door, which then wouldn’t swing fully. The desk was tucked under the TV, so my chair knocked into the luggage rack each time I pushed back.",
        "source_5": "The address sounds central, but our room faced the main avenue and it was nonstop noise—sirens and scooters until after midnight. There’s roadwork across the street, and the jackhammer started before 8 am. To get to the subway, you cross a multi-lane intersection without a proper crosswalk on one corner. The famous seafood restaurant next door drew long lines; on Saturday we waited 75 minutes on the sidewalk, and by the time we sat down we were too tired to enjoy a full meal.",
        "source_6": "Two-night business stay, room 512 near the elevators. The hallway chatter carried right through the door, and the ventilation kicked on with a rattle every half hour. The breakfast buffet looked plentiful, but by the time we sat, the hot dishes were already going tepid, and the check for one person came to $29 with tax. The location made rideshares easy, but traffic at the curb backed up so much in the evening that drop-offs took ten minutes. Between the noise, the breakfast cost-to-quality ratio, and the crowded lobby, I’ll try a different hotel on my next trip."
