        "source_1": "I only bought the box for the aroma. The second I tear open the wrapper, the kitchen fills with toasted coconut and warm chocolate, like a bakery just pulled macaroons from the oven. I’ve started keeping one in my desk drawer because the scent takes over my whole cubicle in the best way. Even after I finish the bar, the empty wrapper still smells like coconut for hours.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on flavor: the coconut note comes across as a little artificial to me, more like sunscreen than toasted flakes, and it hangs around after I’m done. The chocolate chips taste waxy and don’t melt on the tongue, so the sweetness sits there without much depth. I tried a second bar on a different day to be sure, and it had the same flat finish.",
        "source_3": "As an overall snack, these work for my weekday mornings. I grab one with coffee before the school drop-off and it tides me over until noon without getting sticky in the car. The bars survived a hike in my backpack without crumbling, and the portion feels right for 140–160 calories. I paid $5.49 at Whole Foods, which is a touch higher than store brands, but the consistency across the box was reliable.",
        "source_4": "Taking the product as a whole, the box I got had several broken bars and a lot of loose crumbs at the bottom. The chips had partially melted and reset into hard clumps, and the bar itself felt dry, so it shed all over my keyboard when I tried to eat one at work. The sweetness builds fast, and by the third bite I needed water. My kids tried them once and asked for something else, so the rest of the box sat untouched.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on texture: the bar is mostly chewy with occasional crunch from the chocolate chips, and the coconut flakes add a pleasant tug without stringy bits. It doesn’t collapse when I press it, and I can break it into clean halves for my toddler without raining crumbs everywhere. The surface is lightly glossy but not greasy, so it doesn’t leave residue on my fingers.",
        "source_6": "As an overall impression, the coconut character dominates everything else. My spouse walked into the pantry and asked if I’d opened tanning oil, and the scent lingered long after I closed the box. The flavor leans heavily into coconut, crowding out the chocolate chip side of things, so if you were expecting the classic chocolate chip profile, this isn’t it for us. I finished the box, but I’ll reach for the regular chocolate chip version next time."
