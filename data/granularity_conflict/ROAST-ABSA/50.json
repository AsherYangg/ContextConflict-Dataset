        "source_1": "I finished the course last week and felt the weekly flow made it easy to keep up. The professors kept sessions lively with quick polls and on‑screen sketches that clarified the theory. The English captions kept pace even during the guest interview in week 3; I watched on my phone during a commute and later on a laptop without sync hiccups. Quizzes tracked closely with the end‑of‑video summaries, and the review screens pointed me back to the exact timestamp I needed. By the capstone prompt, the structure had me writing tighter analyses of journal excerpts.",
        "source_2": "I’m weighing in only on the translation. Several subtitles read like word‑for‑word carryovers: “acte de langage” showed up as “act of language” instead of “speech act,” and “agrégation” was rendered as “aggregation” rather than the teaching exam. I also saw “rédaction” turned into “redaction” (as in censoring) when the slide clearly meant “writing.” Whole sentences were kept in French order, so modifiers landed in strange places and changed the meaning. I opened a support ticket in week 2, but the corrections didn’t roll out until after I had already taken the quiz that used the same terms.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing just on the quizzes. Each item had a single, clearly defensible answer, and the stems avoided double negatives or fuzzy quantifiers. After submission, the feedback pane linked to the slide number and gave a short rationale for each distractor. Questions shuffled, but the pool stayed consistent across attempts, and the 20‑minute window for 10 items left time to double‑check. The final assessment used short scenarios that mirrored the lecture examples almost verbatim.",
        "source_4": "I’m commenting only on the test questions. In week 2, there was a stem that read “Which statement is not unlikely…,” which forces a double mental flip. Another question said “select one,” but two choices could both work depending on how you define “corpus” earlier in the module. The timer was set to 8 minutes for 12 items, which pushed guessing rather than reasoning. Review mode didn’t point back to the relevant lecture or reading, so it was hard to figure out what I missed.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled for the teaching team and wasn’t disappointed there. Professor L. drew concept maps live on a tablet and uploaded annotated PDFs right after each session. Dr. M. answered my forum post about modality within half a day and linked to two open‑access papers plus a timestamped clip. They also ran a Sunday AMA before the midterm and stayed late to dissect a tricky example. That level of presence made a big difference in how I followed the material.",
        "source_6": "Overall, the content was right up my alley, but the language layer got in the way. Several slides remained in French while the English captions read like machine output—“faux amis” even appeared as “false friendly” in one quiz bank. Without the bit of academic French I picked up in college, I wouldn’t have known that “rédaction scientifique” meant scientific writing when it popped up in week 4. Some quiz items reused those untranslated phrases, and wording didn’t match how terms were introduced in the videos. I ended up combing forum threads just to decode what the questions were asking."
