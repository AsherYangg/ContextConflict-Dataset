        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on battery endurance. Over the last two weeks with two SIMs active (Jio + Airtel), auto brightness around 60% and 120 Hz enabled, the 5080 mAh cell has been lasting me from 7 a.m. to about 11 p.m. with 25–35% left. Typical day: 1 hour of calls, 2 hours of Instagram/Reddit, 90 minutes YouTube, 30 minutes Maps navigation, some photos and Gmail. Screen-on time shows between 7.5 and 9 hours depending on the day. Overnight standby drop is usually 1–2%. I don’t play heavy games, but I do a lot of messaging, and I’ve never had to hunt for a charger before dinner.",
        "source_2": "Strictly about charging time: I measured three full cycles using the in-box 33W brick, charging from 10% to 100% with the screen off, no case, airplane mode on, room temperature ~27°C. Timers came out to 1h18m, 1h16m, and 1h21m. The first 50% fills quickly, but the last 20% slows down a lot, and the battery readout hovered at 98–99% for about 7–8 minutes. The phone gets warm around the camera area mid-charge. If I plug in at 20% before stepping out, I don’t get a full top-up in under an hour.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the cameras only. Daylight shots at 1x look clean on my monitor; brick patterns on a building across the street are clearly visible, and leaves don’t turn into mush unless I push beyond 2x. Indoor restaurant photos are decent if I tap to expose faces; switching to the 48/64 MP mode brings more detail but takes a second longer to process. The “oil painting” effect shows up mostly in dim light when I leave AI and beauty filters on; turning those off reduces smearing. Selfies are fine for video calls, and 1080p video has workable stabilization for walking pace. Sharing via WhatsApp compresses files, which might be why some people think everything looks smeared.",
        "source_4": "Overall take after three months of daily use: I bought it on 03 Oct 22 from Amazon at 22,999 and expected more polish. The battery percentage slides faster than I’m comfortable with during light tasks; while typing this review I watched it drop by 2% in about 10 minutes on Wi‑Fi. The rear camera struggles with indoor textures—my cat’s fur and wall paint both look waxy unless I step outside. Charging from 15% to full took me around 1h15m repeatedly. Performance feels dated when switching between Maps, Chrome with 10 tabs, and Spotify; there’s a half-second hitch that reminds me of older phones. To be fair, the fingerprint reader unlocks quickly and the touch layer is smooth for scrolling, but as a package I don’t feel I got my money’s worth.",
        "source_5": "Holistic impression after a month: Picked it up during a sale for 19,999 as a replacement for my older Note. Setup was straightforward, and after removing a few preinstalled apps, the phone runs my routine—Slack, Outlook, Meet calls, and light BGMI—without hiccups. The battery comfortably covers a full workday with about 6–7 hours of screen time, and a quick top-up at lunch gets me through late meetings. Outdoors photos are perfectly shareable; portraits of my daughter in the park came out sharp with natural colors, and the front camera is fine for Instagram stories. Fingerprint unlock is near instant, and the touch response feels snappy when flicking through long PDFs. For under 25k, it’s been a reliable daily driver.",
        "source_6": "Single-aspect take: touch responsiveness. I type a lot and play a rhythm game that punishes missed taps. The touch layer here tracks fast swipes and micro-adjustments accurately; no ghost touches so far. I ran a multi-touch test and got 10 points recognized, and the 120 Hz panel paired with what feels like high touch sampling makes scrolling through spreadsheets and trimming video clips in CapCut feel precise. Even with a tempered glass applied, edge gestures register cleanly."
