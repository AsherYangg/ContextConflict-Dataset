        "source_1": "I keep these around because my household has both celiac and a soy allergy, and this is one of the few chocolate options I can toss into pancakes, trail mix, and muffins without double-checking every recipe. The chips taste chocolaty enough for the kids’ Saturday waffles, and the bars work for s’mores without anyone asking for a different brand. I’ve taken them to school events where outside snacks have to be free from the usual allergens, and they get a green light from the nurse every time. The price per bag is higher than the store-brand chips, but I’d rather pay for fewer ingredients I have to worry about. Shelf life has been solid too; an open bag in a mason jar stayed fresh through two weeks of lunchbox duty.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on flavor: the chips lean very sweet on my palate, with a light cocoa note but not much of that deep, roasty character I get from 60% bars. There’s a soft, almost creamy finish that lingers, and I pick up a hint of vanilla that dominates in simple cookies. When I tasted a square of the bar side-by-side with a darker competitor, the difference in intensity was obvious. If you prefer a bold, bittersweet profile, this skews mild.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about melt behavior: in chocolate chip cookies baked at 350°F for 11 minutes, the chips held their shape like little buttons and didn’t create those gooey pockets I expected. For ganache, I had to chop them finely and use a hotter-than-usual cream; otherwise they resisted melting and turned slightly grainy. Microwave melting took multiple 30-second bursts with lots of stirring, and even then the flow wasn’t as smooth as typical couverture. They work better as mix-ins than as a fluid coating.",
        "source_4": "Only commenting on packaging: the resealable zipper on two recent 9-oz bags detached from the pouch after a couple of openings, so I ended up using a clip to keep air out. One bag had a weak side seam that split when I tried to squeeze the air out, which led to some bloom showing up a week later. The printing is clear and easy to read, but I wish the bag were thicker or the zipper sturdier. For pantry storage, I’ve started transferring the contents to a jar on day one.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the biggest hurdle for me is cost and availability. My local grocery stores rotate these in and out, and when they’re not on the shelf the online price can swing by a couple of dollars per bag. I tried a subscription, but deliveries slipped twice and I had to scramble during a bake sale week. Between the smaller bag size and the price per ounce, I go through them too quickly for weekly baking projects. I still grab them for special batches, but they haven’t replaced my regular chips.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on allergen safety: my spouse reacts to trace soy, and we’ve had no issues after multiple batches of cookies and a pan of brownies. The bag lists the “free from” panel prominently, and their website links to information about dedicated facilities, which I confirmed by email before serving them at a school event. The product tested fine for us across three different lot codes, which gives me confidence for potlucks where labels get lost."
