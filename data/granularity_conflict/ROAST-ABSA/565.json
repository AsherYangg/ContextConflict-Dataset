        "source_1": "I noticed they tweaked the formula after the 8-pack disappeared. The 12-pack bars lean strongly apricot now—almost jammy—with a syrupy finish. In the old version, the almond stood out and balanced the fruit. With the current batch, I can only eat half a bar without reaching for tea to cut the sweetness, and the almond bits feel fewer and smaller.",
        "source_2": "I’m only tracking the subscription price. My last three deliveries were $17.49, $16.14, and $18.02 for a 12-pack, which puts each bar at roughly $1.35–$1.50. My local grocery posts $2.29 per bar, and the co-op occasionally runs $1.99. When a 20% coupon appears, Amazon dips to $14.39 total. For me, the subscription stays under what I see in stores even after tax.",
        "source_3": "I’ve bought these for school lunches for two years. Since the switch to the 12-pack, the bars feel denser and stickier, and the flavor tilts sweeter than before. My kitchen scale shows 37–38g per bar compared to the older boxes at about 40g. Two of the last ten wrappers had a tacky residue. The kids still ask for the fruit & nut ones first, so these mostly end up in my bag. The subscription saved money at first, then jumped by about $3 over two months, so I paused it while checking local sales.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing on texture only: the current apricot-heavy mix makes the bar chew more like a fruit leather with scattered nut bits. It smears on the palate, and I get little strands that lodge between molars. Refrigerating for an hour firms them up and reduces stickiness; in a warm car, they slump and leave sheen on the wrapper.",
        "source_5": "As a weekday snack, the almond & apricot hits a balance for me—bright fruit with a toasted nut backdrop. The kids still reach for the fruit & nut first, but nobody complains when these go in the lunch boxes. Subscribe & Save keeps the per-bar cost well below what the supermarket charges, and deliveries have been on schedule for six months. I do miss the less-sweet version from the old 8-pack, but the current recipe pairs nicely with coffee.",
        "source_6": "Strictly about portion and macros: the latest label lists 11g sugars per bar versus the 9g on my last 8-pack, and the weight reads 38g. Calorie count nudged up to 180 from the 170 I noted before. The bar footprint looks thinner but wider, which changes how it fits in my kid’s snack container. This is the kind of change I track because we plan snacks around sugar grams."
