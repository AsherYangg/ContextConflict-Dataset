        "source_1": "I go through a bag every couple of weeks and keep it at my desk for a mid-morning bite. The nuts have a crisp snap, the dried fruit is pliable instead of leathery, and the yogurt pieces taste creamy without coating my mouth in wax. I sprinkle a handful over plain Greek yogurt and it turns into a satisfying breakfast. My last shipment landed during a 95°F week in Sacramento and, to my surprise, nothing fused together or melted into a lump; the pieces were still loose and easy to mix.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on just the nuts: mine were more soft than crisp. The almonds had that papery skin still on and a flat, slightly oily taste, and a few cashews were bendy rather than firm. It also felt peanut-heavy compared to the photo on the listing. I toasted a batch in a pan to try to revive the texture, which helped a bit, but out of the bag they didn’t have the fresh crunch I was hoping for.",
        "source_3": "On price only: Subscribe & Save took 15% off my second delivery, plus there was a one-time coupon, so I paid $9.38 for the 16 oz bag (about 59 cents per ounce). That beat my local grocery by a wide margin. Setting the cadence to every six weeks fit my pace, and the discount stuck when I moved the delivery date forward by a week.",
        "source_4": "I bought this for the “simple ingredients” angle, but the back panel lists more than just nuts, fruit, and yogurt. Mine reads sugar, palm kernel oil, yogurt powder (milk), whey, soy lecithin, tapioca dextrin, natural flavor, and mixed tocopherols for freshness. I had to look up what tocopherols and dextrin are. The nutrition line also shows 9 g added sugar per 1/3 cup, which caught me off guard for something I planned to toss on oatmeal.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: the bag I received in late July arrived warm, and the yogurt bits had clumped into white pebbles that I had to whack against the counter to break apart. The dried cranberries were tough around the edges, and a lot of the mix stuck to my molars. After a couple of handfuls, I moved it to the freezer in hopes the texture would improve when cold.",
        "source_6": "Another angle on pricing: my first subscribe order was $10.99, but the next cycle jumped to $13.49 even with the discount, and the bag weighed 14 oz instead of 16 oz. The app showed the discount applied, yet the base price had climbed, so the per-ounce cost went up. I paused the schedule to avoid the fluctuation, which kind of defeats the whole “set it and forget it” idea."
