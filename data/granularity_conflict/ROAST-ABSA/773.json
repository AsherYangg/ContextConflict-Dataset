        "source_1": "I keep a multipack of Pop Chips Garlic Parmesan at my desk for the afternoon slump. The puffs have a clean snap when I bite in, and they don’t leave my fingers greasy, so I can keep typing. I actually get more of the Parmesan than the garlic in my bags, which works well with a cup of tomato soup. A single bag has enough in it to feel like a snack without feeling weighed down afterward.",
        "source_2": "Only commenting on the texture here: I bought a case last week, and two of the bags were oddly soft. They looked puffed, but the bite was quiet and a little spongy, almost like the crunch had leaked out during shipping. The expiration date was months out, so it wasn’t old stock. I opened a Cheddar bag from the same box and that one cracked loudly, so the Garlic Parmesan batch seemed inconsistent on crispness.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on flavor balance: the garlic hits first and then keeps going, while the Parmesan hangs in the background. After a handful, I noticed a lingering garlicky aftertaste that stuck around through a Zoom call, and my partner commented on the smell across the room. I tried shaking the bag to move the seasoning around, but most of the dust had collected at the bottom and made the last few chips extra intense. If you’re looking for a clear Parmesan note, it’s faint compared to the garlic.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the bag I opened during a movie night wasn’t a good match for me. The chips were very thin and built up a salty, artificial-tasting film on my tongue, and I grabbed a big glass of water after a few minutes. The garlic flavor kept layering with each bite and edged into a bitter, metallic aftertaste. I ended up setting the bowl aside and didn’t finish the bag.",
        "source_5": "I’m tracking calories right now, so I bought these for a lighter swap with sandwiches. The label shows around 120 calories per ounce, and the portion size made it easy to log without pulling out a scale. They don’t feel oily and worked when I wanted something crunchy, but the sodium is noticeable, so I pair them with seltzer and keep the rest of the meal simple. On nights when I get the munchies, a small bowl satisfies the need to chew without wrecking my totals."
