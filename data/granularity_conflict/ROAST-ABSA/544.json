        "source_1": "I moved to this phone for the extra RAM and storage, and it’s been solid for everyday tasks. I’ve got around 40 apps installed, and switching between banking, email, and Instagram is smooth with no reloads. The camera does well outside—street signs and leaves are sharp—while indoor shots can look a bit flat unless I tap to focus. Using the stock charger, I consistently hit 50% in about 17 minutes and can get from 20% to 70% during a coffee break. I don’t play games, so I can’t judge graphics-heavy performance, but calls, video chats, and documents are handled without drama.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on the camera because that’s what matters most to me. Daylight photos come out clean and natural, with fast focus on moving subjects like kids at the park. After sunset, it struggles: bright shop signs blow out, faces soften, and night mode requires a 3–4 second hold with noticeable grain. Portrait edge detection clips curly hair and glasses frames more often than I’d like. It’s fine for casual snaps, but I pack a compact camera for evening walks.",
        "source_3": "My use case is performance, not gaming. With 12GB RAM, I can keep Slack, Sheets, two browsers, and Maps all open and jump between them without the apps restarting. Copying a 2GB video internally takes under a minute, and exporting spreadsheets is snappy. I did try a 15-minute Genshin session out of curiosity: frame rates dipped during heavy scenes and the top-left of the back warmed up. For office work and multitasking, it behaves predictably.",
        "source_4": "I care about charging behavior, so I tracked it for a week. With the bundled brick and cable, it goes from 5% to 55% in about 18 minutes; 50% consistently lands around 16–18. Past 80%, the speed tapers and a full charge is roughly 50–55 minutes. If I scroll socials while charging, it slows noticeably, but with the screen off it stays on pace and the phone doesn’t get hot. This makes short midday top-ups practical.",
        "source_5": "Looking at the whole experience, it’s a mixed bag for me. The camera app sometimes takes a beat to open from the lock screen, and video stabilization introduces a jitter when I’m walking. Charging up to halfway is fast, yet by late afternoon I’m often under 30% and reaching for the cable again, which wasn’t my routine on my last phone. The interface includes promotional tiles in the theme store and file manager that I keep dismissing. Storage is ample, but system updates consume space without a clear breakdown.",
        "source_6": "I bought this mainly for RAM and storage, so that’s my focus. On the 12GB/256GB model, Lightroom, Maps, Spotify, Notes, and two browsers stay resident and rarely reload; edits in Lightroom remain intact when I switch away. Over a weekend trip I shot about 40GB of 4K footage and still had lots of headroom for podcasts and offline maps. The one annoyance is background management—my podcast app sometimes gets killed when I launch the camera or start a video call, interrupting playback. For media hoarding and multitasking, the capacity and speed are the reasons I picked it."
