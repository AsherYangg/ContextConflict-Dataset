        "source_1": "I took Zac and David’s mountains course over five weekends, usually knocking out one module on Sunday mornings. The short video lessons fit nicely between errands, and the weekly quizzes nudged me to revisit the trickier sections on glaciation and avalanche safety. The case study on the Rockies helped me plan a spring trip to Banff—now I can actually name the features I’m looking at. If they ever offer a follow-up centered on BC and Alberta, I’d jump in since those regional snippets were the parts I kept rewatching.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the format: the course is chopped into a lot of micro-lectures, sometimes three minutes long, with readings and a quiz wedged between them. I found myself clicking next-next-next far more than settling into a groove, and the embedded questions often repeated the same facts I had just heard. The “reflection” prompts felt like a checkbox exercise, and the interactive map tool didn’t load reliably on my iPad—desktop was fine, but I commute with a tablet, so it kept breaking my rhythm.",
        "source_3": "I’m commenting strictly on the instructors. Zac and David are personable and their field clips—like the segment in Jasper standing beside a talus slope—make the concepts stick. That said, they occasionally lean into inside jokes, and I sometimes wished they’d pause to label diagrams longer before cutting to the next shot. On the discussion boards, Zac replied to my terminology question about cirques within a day, which helped me adjust my notes for the subsequent module.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, my biggest hurdle wasn’t the material—it was the Coursera platform. The mobile app on Android kept buffering at 720p even when my connection was solid, captions drifted out of sync by a couple seconds, and two modules showed as incomplete after I finished the quizzes. I had to clear the cache and relaunch multiple times to get progress to register. The content itself was organized enough to follow, but the tech hiccups stretched a four-week plan into six.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the depth of the geology explanations: the glacier dynamics section introduced mass balance qualitatively but didn’t carry through with basic equations or sample calculations. I would have liked a simple walkthrough—like plugging numbers into an accumulation–ablation example—before moving on. Likewise, the Canada-specific parts skimmed the BC/AB ranges at a high level; naming a few formations without tying them to specific stratigraphic columns left me hunting for external references.",
        "source_6": "For an overall judgment, this felt tailored to newcomers to earth science. Terms like orogeny, moraine, and horn were explained with clear visuals, the pacing was gentle, and the quizzes prioritized recognition over derivations. I came in having done a semester of geoscience, so I cruised through most of it and only slowed down on the avalanche module’s decision frameworks. I’d recommend it to friends who are curious about mountain landscapes, but those looking for rigorous modeling or advanced field methods might want something more technical."
