        "source_1": "I’m usually wary of Starbucks because so many of their blends lean smoky, but this vanilla bag tasted different to me. On a V60 (15 g to 240 g, 96°C water, ~2:30 drawdown, Encore at 14), the cup came out clean with toasted sugar and light cocoa, none of that campfire edge. If they roasted more of their beans to this level, I’d buy them more often.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the vanilla flavor: the first mug is great with a splash of milk, but by the second cup the vanilla hangs around on my palate and starts to feel heavy. At the office, brewed in a 12‑cup drip machine, the aftertaste builds through the morning and I end up switching to an unflavored bean after lunch to reset my taste buds.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I keep this in my weekend rotation. A 1:16 ratio in a Chemex gives a smooth pot that my family finishes with pancakes and fruit, and guests comment on the bakery‑like aroma. I marked it 4/5 because I like to save a perfect score for the rare blends that stop me in my tracks, but this one earns a regular spot on the shelf.",
        "source_4": "I’m a vanilla‑everything person, and this hits the spot without needing syrups. In a flat white (double shot pulled over a coarse grind moka pot concentrate; yes, unconventional), the vanilla holds up against milk and stays fragrant to the last sip. I’ve run through two bags already and clicked five stars without second‑guessing.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on roast level: my bag skewed darker than expected. Even with a coarse French press grind (Encore at 28) and a 4‑minute steep, there’s a charred edge that steps on the vanilla. Cold brew (1:5 concentrate, 18 hours) toned it down, but hot cups still read smoky to me. Could be batch variation or my kettle, but it reminded me why I often reach for lighter seasonal roasts instead."
