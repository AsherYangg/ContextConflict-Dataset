        "source_1": "I grew up in Kingston and this can took me straight back to Sunday breakfast. I rinsed the pieces gently, then folded them into sautéed onions, thyme, and flaked saltfish. The petals stayed mostly intact, with that soft, buttery feel and a pale yellow color that looked just right on the plate. No tinny note, and the brine smelled clean. One can stretched to two generous servings with fried dumplings and plantains, and I ended up ordering more because it scratched that homesick itch perfectly.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on texture: the pieces in my can were extremely delicate—so delicate that even a gentle stir turned them into a paste within minutes. I tried chilling them first and using a silicone spatula, but most of the “petals” still collapsed. Flavor aside, I was specifically looking for firmer chunks that could hold their shape for a nicer presentation with codfish, and this batch didn’t deliver on that single requirement.",
        "source_3": "I bought a 6‑pack for a family brunch and ran into headaches that overshadowed the meal. Two cans arrived with deep dents near the rim; one had a compromised seal and went straight into the trash. Of the remaining cans, a couple were filled with lots of tiny fragments instead of full petals, and the expiration date was only four months out. Between the shipping issues, short shelf life, and the price per ounce, it didn’t feel like a pantry staple I could rely on, even though the taste was fine once cooked.",
        "source_4": "Judging purely on flavor, this is spot on. After a quick rinse to cut the brine, the ackee picked up thyme, scallion, and a touch of Scotch bonnet beautifully. There was a gentle, buttery richness without bitterness or a metallic edge, and it didn’t fight the saltfish. I served it over white rice for lunch and scraped the pan clean. On taste alone, I’d keep a couple of cans in the cupboard.",
        "source_5": "I’m rating my experience mainly on convenience and portioning. The pull tab on one can snapped off, so I had to grab the opener; draining was tricky because the soft pieces tried to slip through the strainer. Cleanup was quick, but one can was barely enough for my appetite, so for a family of four we needed three cans with sides. If you want a fast breakfast before work, it’s doable, but you’ll need multiple cans and a gentle hand to keep it from turning to a soft scramble."
