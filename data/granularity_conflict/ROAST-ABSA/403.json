        "source_1": "I booked a “city view” king for a midweek stay and got Room 317. The window looked straight onto a service alley with HVAC units and a construction crane, so the skyline was mostly blocked. The double-pane glass had a foggy layer between the panes, which made the lights even hazier at night. I tried for a higher floor, but the front desk said they were fully committed. The rooftop terrace would have helped, but a private event kept it closed the one evening I had free.",
        "source_2": "We did an anniversary weekend and leaned into the old-school vibe. The lobby bar mixed classic martinis in coupe glasses, the soundtrack stayed on the crooner side, and our corner room on the 12th floor framed the skyline like a postcard once the sun went down. The room had a curved sofa, terrazzo floors, and a moody color palette that worked well for a couple’s trip. It’s a little removed from downtown, but with a rental car we were at Bishop Arts in under 10 minutes and back in time for a late-night nightcap.",
        "source_3": "I came specifically for the mid-century look and left wishing they’d gone for fewer props and more substance. The “wood” paneling near the elevators was lifting at the seams, the chrome trim on the nightstand had pitting, and the neon accents hummed audibly in the hallway. In my room, the velvet headboard had visible dust lines where the pillows stop, and the framed art looked like low-res prints. The dark paint in the corridors made it hard to read the room numbers, so I kept overshooting my door.",
        "source_4": "As a solo business traveler without a car, the location was a hurdle. The nearest coffee shop was a 15–20 minute walk along a busy road with patchy sidewalks, rideshare prices spiked during the morning rush, and the onsite cafe didn’t open early enough for my 7 a.m. calls. My room had no proper desk—just a low coffee table—so I balanced my laptop on a suitcase. After dark the area felt quiet and the path lighting was sparse, so I ended up eating in the hotel rather than wandering out.",
        "source_5": "I chose this place for a proposal night and ran into a few surprises. The walls carried sound from the next room’s bachelor group, the bed frame squeaked every time we shifted, and the neon from the exterior sign slipped around the blackout curtains. The lobby bar’s playlist thumped until about 1 a.m., which bled up faintly to our floor. Housekeeping did a sweet petal turn-down, but there was an old champagne cork left on the balcony, which broke the mood when we stepped outside.",
        "source_6": "I’m a sucker for a good skyline, and the 17th-floor king delivered. Floor-to-ceiling glass faced downtown with an unobstructed line to Reunion Tower; I watched a summer storm roll in and then the lights flicker back across the buildings. The rooftop terrace became my photo spot at sunset, and even from the bed I could pick out landmarks. The shades lifted by button in the morning, which made sunrise a slow, cinematic reveal."
