        "source_1": "I picked up a whole case because my local market keeps running out, and these have turned into my desk snack around 3 p.m. The salt-free cakes have a toasty, almost caramel-like note to me—oddly reminiscent of Cracker Jacks when I eat them plain with black coffee. Most days I spread a thin layer of almond butter and a drizzle of honey, but even straight out of the sleeve they scratch that craving to munch like popcorn. One pack lives in my backpack, one in the pantry, and I rotate them so the open sleeve doesn’t sit longer than a week. For anyone wondering, they’re light enough that two cakes feel like a snack, and a case gets me through about a month.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on texture only: I’m all about the crunch, and these are consistently snappy. When I press on the center, they don’t compress like foam; they break cleanly with a crisp edge and minimal squeak. I clip the bag with a binder clip after opening, and the cakes keep their bite for 3–4 days without getting chewy. I’ve tried other brands that go soft by day two; this batch (date code ending in 324) held up just fine. I eat them plain before runs to test the structure, and they don’t crumble all over the car.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on shipping/packaging only: My case arrived with two outer corners of the box dented, and the air pillows didn’t fill the empty space. Three sleeves had the top two cakes shattered into crumbs, and a couple stacks were slanted like they took a hit. It still tastes the same, but I bought whole cakes to stack avocado and tomato; balancing slices on fragments is a mess. I ended up pouring the broken ones into a bowl like cereal with yogurt to avoid wasting them. If they add tighter packing or a divider between sleeves, it would save a lot of crumble.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on flavor only: I grabbed the salt-free version first and expected a richer taste from the brown rice, but on its own it’s pretty muted. I tried topping with hummus, smoked salmon, even a sprinkle of everything seasoning, and that’s when it wakes up. Plain, it leans more like plain puffed rice than anything resembling caramel—no sweetness that I can detect. If you like snacks that stand on their own right out of the bag, this isn’t that for me; it’s more of a blank canvas that needs a savory or sweet layer.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture take: I rotate these with the Lundberg Buttery Caramel cakes for the family. The kids reach for the caramel ones on movie night, while I keep the salt-free for breakfast with peanut butter and banana. I set up a monthly Subscribe & Save, and every delivery so far has been on time with sleeves stacked straight and unbroken, which surprised me given how fragile these can be. Price per cake shakes out okay when buying the 12-pack, and my co-op usually has them in stock if I run out early. Between the eco-farmed label, the no-salt base, and the flexible topping options, it’s become a pantry regular even though the flavor by itself is pretty understated."
