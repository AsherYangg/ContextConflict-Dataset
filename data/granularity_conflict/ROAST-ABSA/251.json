        "source_1": "I stayed three nights and felt looked after from the moment I walked in. Farooq greeted me by name, brought a pot of mint tea while I checked in, and later had the front desk print my museum timed-entry tickets. The room on the fifth floor opened to a quiet courtyard, the bathroom tile and glass looked freshly polished, and turn-down came with little butter cookies. From the door, it took me about ten minutes on foot to reach the river, and the staff mapped a route that avoided the busiest intersections.",
        "source_2": "I’m weighing in only on location. The hotel sits on a narrow one-way street that taxis kept missing; two drivers circled the block before finding the entrance. Nighttime noise from nearby bars carried up to my second-floor window, and delivery trucks started clattering at dawn. Getting to my meetings near La Défense took two metro transfers and about 35 minutes each way, so the spot worked for sightseeing but not for my schedule.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on service: check-in at 2:00 p.m. turned into a 3:40 p.m. wait with no updates unless I asked. My request for extra pillows was acknowledged twice but never delivered, and a scheduled 6:30 a.m. wake-up call didn’t come through. Farooq was warm when present and offered espresso while I waited, but the rest of the team seemed stretched; calls to the desk rang a long time before anyone picked up.",
        "source_4": "Only commenting on cleanliness. The bathroom grout by the shower showed dark patches, and I found a long hair on the sink on arrival. Dust lined the top of the headboard and the minibar shelf, and one of the robes had faint makeup smudges on the collar. Housekeeping corrected most of it after I flagged it, but it took until the next afternoon.",
        "source_5": "My overall take after a weekend stay: the building has ornate mirrors and velvet chairs in the lobby, but the room itself felt tight—two carry-ons had to go under the desk to clear the walkway. The elevator comfortably fits two people without bags, and our “courtyard” view looked onto a brick wall a few feet away. Breakfast downstairs ran 26€ per person for a small buffet, so we ended up at the café across the street. On the plus side, the bed linens were comfortable and the walk to the Louvre was easy, though street noise persisted even with the windows shut."
