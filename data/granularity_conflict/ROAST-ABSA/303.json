        "source_1": "I’m zooming in on the bar only: I sat at the lobby counter around 11:30 p.m. on a Thursday and again at 10 p.m. Friday. The bartender, Marcus, asked what I usually drink and steered me from my usual bourbon to a rye old fashioned, explaining the bitters they use. He checked in without hovering, kept my water filled, and made a no-sugar mocktail for my partner without rolling his eyes. When a loud group arrived, he de-escalated with a calm tone and moved them to a high-top. No profanity, no attitude, and the tab was correct down to the cent.",
        "source_2": "My experience was strictly about rates and how the manager handled a price I found online. I showed the front desk a Hotels.com listing that was $28 less per night than what I’d booked, and the manager, Sofia, pulled it up on her screen, verified the dates, and adjusted my rate on the spot. She also removed a $20 per night destination fee because it wasn’t listed on the OTA page. The reprinted folio matched exactly, and the whole thing took five minutes right after check-in at 3:10 p.m. I didn’t have to call anyone else or argue about fine print.",
        "source_3": "For an overall take: after a Broadway show we stopped at the lobby bar just after midnight, and the bartender told us they were “done pouring” and followed with profanity when I asked for a simple vodka soda. My wife was stunned, so we walked to the front desk to talk it through; the manager’s response was that we should have ordered earlier if drinks were so important. Another couple in our group showed a cheaper OTA rate, and the manager declined to match it, saying “book it next time if you want that price.” Our room itself was fine, but that late-night exchange colored the rest of the stay. We checked out early the next morning rather than extend a second night.",
        "source_4": "Big-picture perspective: three-night visit for a conference, and things ran smoothly from the start. Check-in took under three minutes, my key worked the first time, and the king room on the 14th floor faced a courtyard so I slept without traffic noise. Housekeeping refreshed towels daily without moving my toiletries, and the iron actually worked, which saved me before a 9 a.m. session. The bar was quiet when I stopped by at 11:45 p.m.; the bartender offered hot tea and lemon when I said I’d had enough alcohol for the night. Subway access was straightforward, and I never felt adrift trying to get to meetings around Times Square.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on location: the property sits about half a block from Times Square, so I could grab the N/Q/R/W at 49th or walk five minutes to the 1/2/3 at 42nd. Coffee runs were easy—Joe & The Juice and a deli across the street opened by 6 a.m.—but the sidewalk felt packed most of the day. Street noise spiked around midnight, especially on Saturday, so light sleepers might want earplugs or a room facing the interior. Walking to Bryant Park took about 12 minutes, and the theater district is basically around the corner. If you’re here for shows and subways, the placement makes getting around simple.",
        "source_6": "On booking strategy alone: I called the hotel directly on a Tuesday afternoon and asked about any midweek promotions, and the reservations agent quoted a “fall special” that beat Expedia and Hotels.com by $35 per night. She emailed a confirmation with the lower rate and taxes itemized, so I had it in writing. At check-in the amount matched exactly, and there was no push to switch to a higher category or add fees I didn’t agree to. If you’re flexible on dates, phoning in midweek seemed to unlock a better deal than the big sites."
