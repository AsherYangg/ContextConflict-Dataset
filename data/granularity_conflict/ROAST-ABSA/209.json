        "source_1": "I bought these pods for my office Keurig and they’ve turned into an easy afternoon warmer. On the 6 oz strong setting, the cup gives off a baked-apple scent with a hint of cinnamon. It doesn’t have the cloudy heft of the jugs I bring home from farm stands, but it scratches the itch for something apple without loading up on sugar. After a week I’d gone through a sleeve and kept a box at my desk.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing strictly on taste here: the apple comes across like candy, and the sweetener leaves a metallic edge that hangs around long after the cup is empty. I’m fine with diet sodas and stevia in coffee, but this reads perfumey to me and the finish turns sharp enough that I reached for water to rinse it away.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on sweetness only: it lands in a comfortable spot for me. First sip is crisp apple, then a gentle spice, and the sweetener feels clean—no throat burn, no waxy film. I brew at 8 oz and splash a bit of cold water to sip it right away; it reminds me of the clear ciders at fall festivals, just lighter and easier to drink after dinner.",
        "source_4": "Judging the whole experience, it didn’t work out in my kitchen. I ran four pods through two machines (a K-Slim and a Mini), tried 6, 8, and 10 oz, and even tossed in a cinnamon stick. Every cup looked pale and tasted thin, and two friends set their mugs down after a single sip during game night. I ended up bringing the rest to the office communal stash.",
        "source_5": "This is all about prep for me. At 10 oz the cup turns watery; at 5–6 oz the apple shows up and a squeeze of lemon helps keep the sweetness in check. If you’re picturing the dense, tart stuff you get at a Vermont roadside stand, you’ll be caught off guard. Treated more like a flavored tea than a true cider, it behaves much better."
