        "source_1": "I keep a box of OSTRIM sticks in my desk and another in the car for hikes. The peppered beef-ostrich blend has a clean snap and a lean, meaty chew that keeps me satisfied until dinner. They don’t leave grease on my hands, and the wrappers hold up in a backpack without bursting. Macros fit my cutting phase—lots of protein per stick with barely any fat—so I can grab two after a lunchtime walk and stay on track.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on flavor/texture: the stick I opened was dry around the edges and a bit rubbery in the middle, like it never decided what it wanted to be. The seasoning leaned heavily into liquid smoke, and there was a gamey aftertaste that lingered for an hour. I tried chilling the next one to see if it improved the bite, but it still crumbled near the tip and tugged at my teeth. My partner took one bite and pushed the rest back to me.",
        "source_3": "I buy OSTRIM for the numbers, not the experience. My dietitian has me hitting 25–30g protein per snack, and two sticks get me there with minimal fat and almost no sugar. I eat them in the gym parking lot post-lift because they don’t spike my glucose the way bars do. I can log them in MyFitnessPal in seconds and move on; taste is secondary for me, and these fit the plan.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, these didn’t agree with me. Twice after an afternoon stick I felt cramping during my run, and the sodium had me draining my water bottle before mile two. Two wrappers in the last pack had tiny tears, and those sticks were tough and chalky compared to the others. I’m finishing the box on road trips where timing is flexible, but I’m not reaching for them before workouts anymore.",
        "source_5": "Single-aspect—smell in shared spaces: I cracked open an OSTRIM at my cubicle and immediately got side-eye from two coworkers. The aroma spreads fast and has that pet-treat vibe if you’re not used to it. I now eat them outside or in the car with the windows down, because the scent hangs around longer than I expected. Great for portability, but not something I can open during a meeting without complaints."
