        "source_1": "I came in as a spreadsheet-first analyst and by week 3 I was rewriting my daily workflow in pandas. The lectures on groupby-agg and tidy reshaping let me replace two clunky SQL exports, and the forum code reviews pushed me to stop peeking at the test set. The p-hacking readings plus the debate thread on multiple comparisons changed how I document hypotheses; I started preregistering my A/B test metrics and keeping a holdout untouched. I wrapped up the capstone with a cleaner pipeline (runtime down from 12 minutes to about 50 seconds) and have been checking the course page daily for the next module to open.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the p-hacking materials: the reading list leaned on older blog posts and one classic paper, but there wasn’t a notebook where we could intentionally overfit and then fix it. Discussions went in circles over the definition of p-hacking instead of walking through sequential testing or alpha spending, and I didn’t see instructor feedback when threads got stuck. An exercise that forces us to run 20 comparisons and then apply corrections (Bonferroni, BH) would have made the warnings concrete.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on syntax and pandas patterns: the distinction between .loc and .iloc finally clicked after the instructor drew side-by-side index diagrams. The vectorization section showed why my for-loops were dragging; refactoring a 1,200-line ETL script with chaining and assign() cut it to 420 lines and shaved deployment time to under a minute. The apply-vs-map examples with real sales data (missing months, ragged indices) matched the kind of mess I see at work, so I could mirror the steps without guessing.",
        "source_4": "Speaking about the overall experience, the videos felt uneven—some weeks jumped from EDA to modeling with steps skipped, and captions had mismatches that made me rewind. Two assignments referenced datasets that were moved, so I spent more time hunting links than analyzing. Office hours listed on the syllabus were canceled twice. The bright spot was the case study on p-hacking, which made me rethink how I select metrics, but by the end I paused the specialization to revisit basics elsewhere.",
        "source_5": "Only about scheduling: I finished the core material in May and the course page has said “next module coming soon” ever since. Support replies were polite but nonspecific, and the announcement thread hasn’t been updated in three months. I kept my subscription for two extra billing cycles in case the new module dropped, but after the latest delay I set a reminder to check back later rather than keep paying without fresh content."
