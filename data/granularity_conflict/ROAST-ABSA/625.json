        "source_1": "I’m on the current WW plan and bought the 11.3 oz box from this listing. I scanned the barcode in the app and it came up as 4 points for two cookies. When I double-checked by entering the nutrition manually (about 60 calories, 3g sat fat, 3g sugar per cookie), it landed in the same range. I’ve seen older plan screenshots floating around, but on my plan it isn’t anywhere close to 1 point for 3–4 cookies.",
        "source_2": "I purchased the “Original Shortbread Fingers” specifically to check the label after reading comments about additives. My box lists exactly four ingredients: wheat flour, butter, sugar, salt. The allergen notice says milk and wheat, and “may contain traces of tree nuts.” No emulsifiers, no flavorings, no leavening agents printed on mine. Batch code was stamped on the top flap, and the country of origin printed as Scotland. If someone saw extra ingredients, they may have had a different variant.",
        "source_3": "I’ve gone through two boxes in the last month and here’s the overall experience: the sleeves keep most pieces intact, though I usually find a couple broken ones per tray. The texture is sandy and dissolves fast, and with a black tea I’m satisfied after two pieces. The panel shows 3 cookies at 180 calories in my box, which makes the serving feel small for a snack. Price on my order history was $5.49, and the shelf life date gave me just under six months.",
        "source_4": "I tried the mixed pack with lemon and chocolate chip alongside the plain. The lemon sleeves list “natural lemon flavor” and citric acid, and the chocolate chip sleeves include cocoa parts plus soy lecithin in the chips. The plain shortbread sleeves are just flour, butter, sugar, salt. If someone is talking about “additives,” I suspect they’re looking at the flavored sleeves rather than the plain.",
        "source_5": "My box wasn’t a great batch overall: a waxy film on the surface and a faint vanilla-like note that didn’t fit shortbread. After tasting, I checked the fine print on the side panel and mine had “natural flavor” added, which surprised me because the front said “original.” The cookies felt dense and a bit floury, and I ended up crushing them for a cheesecake base rather than serving them with coffee.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on packaging only: the plastic tray has shallow wells and the sleeves shift during transit. Out of 24 cookies, 9 arrived broken into two or three pieces, with a layer of crumbs at the bottom of each sleeve. The shipping box had minimal padding and the inner retail box wasn’t snug, so everything rattled. Freshness seemed fine—no stale smell—but presentation was rough if you’re trying to plate them for guests."
