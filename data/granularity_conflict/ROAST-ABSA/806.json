        "source_1": "I signed up mainly to get the hang of Python’s quirks, and the syntax sections didn’t quite clear the fog for me. The lecture on slicing showed simple examples like s[2:5], but never clarified how negative steps interact with boundaries, so I ended up trial-and-erroring in the REPL. Comprehensions were introduced with a single-line filter, but nesting and multiple for-clauses were skipped. Even indentation caused hiccups—my editor auto-inserted tabs and the course assumed spaces without showing how to configure that. I could write a small script by week two, but when I tried reading someone’s open-source code with chained comprehensions, I still had to keep the docs open.",
        "source_2": "Coming in with 18 years in Java/C++, I used this Coursera course to get practical with Python. The walkthroughs had me coding alongside the videos—reading text files, splitting lines, counting occurrences, then stepping into HTTP requests and JSON parsing. I set up Anaconda and replicated the demos in VS Code, and by the third week I had a script that pulled Jira items and summarized them to a CSV. The instructor’s humor made the sessions feel like office hours; once or twice a bit ran long and I skipped ahead, but by the end I was shipping little utilities at work.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on organization: the modules are stacked in a clear staircase—variables → loops → lists/dicts → files → networking. Each week followed the same rhythm: brief lectures, ungraded practice, then a graded task that tied the week’s pieces together. The checklists at the start of each lesson helped me see what was coming, and the recaps at the end made pausing and resuming straightforward. I took a break for ten days and re-entered at the next module without feeling lost.",
        "source_4": "I was hoping for deeper material on idiomatic patterns, but the early weeks lingered on basics like numeric types and simple conditionals. When I tried to solve assignments using itertools and more compact constructs, the auto-grader flagged “unexpected output,” even though my results matched on sample inputs. The discussion forum had answers from years ago that no longer matched the current prompts, and the certificate flow nudged me toward a subscription before I was sure the later sections would accelerate. I bowed out after the strings unit and moved to a cookbook-style resource.",
        "source_5": "On the instructor specifically: the lectures blend live coding with stories and jokes. The locker analogy for dictionaries finally made key lookups stick for me, but there were moments when a joke stretched a five-minute segment into ten and I found myself scrubbing to the next code block. His tone is approachable, and he answers “why” as much as “how,” but on days when I was sneaking lessons between meetings, I wished the tangents were trimmed so I could fit a whole topic into a single break."
