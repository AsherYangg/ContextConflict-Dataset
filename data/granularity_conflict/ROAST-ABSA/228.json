        "source_1": "I bought the iPhone 15 two months ago mainly for performance, and it’s been smooth under heavy use. My weekday routine is Slack + Outlook + Zoom calls while Spotify streams over Bluetooth, and I jump into Google Maps for a 90‑minute commute without any stutter. I keep around 35 Safari tabs open, and app switching is instant even with YouTube and Reddit in the background. I’ve only force-closed an app once (a game update glitch), but I’ve never had to reboot for a freeze. Uptime has hit 16 days with no slowdown.",
        "source_2": "I cared most about the price because I was upgrading from a three‑year‑old phone on a budget. With Apple’s trade‑in and a carrier rebate, my out‑of‑pocket dropped to what I’d normally pay for a midrange device, and the monthly installment felt manageable. Nine months in, the resale quotes I’m getting are high enough that I won’t lose much if I switch next year. I don’t feel like I overspent considering the support and update timeline. For my use, the cost has worked out better than previous Android flagships I’ve owned.",
        "source_3": "In my third week, the phone started locking up during routine tasks. The first time it happened, I was checking my banking app and the screen stopped responding; even the swipe gestures wouldn’t register, and I had to do a force restart. It repeated twice more that week—once while switching between the camera and Messages, and once on a call where the proximity wake wouldn’t bring the screen back. I restored the phone and updated to the latest iOS, but the freeze came back the next morning when opening Mail. Apple ran diagnostics and said the hardware was fine, but the inconsistency has made me keep a backup phone nearby.",
        "source_4": "I’m focused on app reliability because I use the phone for work check-ins. Bank logins with Face ID, airline boarding passes in Wallet, and Microsoft Authenticator codes all open instantly, even when I’m hopping between them in a rush. The app switcher never hesitates and keyboards don’t lag, which is critical when I’m approving expenses and replying to Slack threads. After 10–12 days of uptime, I still haven’t encountered a spinner or unresponsive screen. It’s been dependable for this specific workflow.",
        "source_5": "After a month, the device started to feel unpredictable as a daily driver. Swiping between home screens sometimes pauses for a second, and I’ve had two instances where the screen wouldn’t register taps until a hard reboot. The hiccups tend to show up when I’m juggling Maps, Music, and Instagram, which is exactly when I need it to be responsive. Considering the purchase price, that behavior stings. I’ve told a couple of friends to hold off until a software update sorts this out."
