        "source_1": "I stayed two nights for a conference and the place still has that fresh, newly finished feel—clean lines, unscuffed hall carpet, and fixtures that actually work the way they’re supposed to. Check-in took maybe three minutes, and the person at the desk rerouted my airport shuttle when my flight got delayed. The bed was supportive, pillows came in different densities, and the blackout shade plus a solid door seal made the room quiet enough that I slept straight through. I noticed there isn’t a pool, but I wasn’t planning to swim anyway, so it didn’t change my stay.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on one thing: there’s no pool. I was traveling with two kids in the middle of August, and our routine is an hour of swimming before bedtime to burn energy. The front desk kindly pointed us to a public pool about five blocks away, but hauling towels and dealing with evening crowds wasn’t the low-key wind-down we were hoping for. If pool time is part of your family plan, this setup makes evenings more complicated.",
        "source_3": "All I cared about on this trip was sleep, and the bed delivered. The mattress felt medium-firm with enough give at the shoulders, the pillows included two soft and two firmer ones, and the sheets were smooth without that scratchy detergent film. AC held the room at 69°F without cycling loudly, and I didn’t hear hallway chatter. I woke up without neck or back stiffness, which is rare for me on the road.",
        "source_4": "The desk staff absolutely carried my stay. I arrived at 11:45 a.m., and they tagged my bag, then texted at 1:38 p.m. when the room was ready. They pulled up a neighborhood map, circled a late-night ramen spot for me, and printed a five-page contract without rolling their eyes at my last-minute ask. When I called down for a late checkout, they granted 1 p.m. without making me jump through hoops. Being greeted by name the second evening was a nice touch.",
        "source_5": "The building looks new and the room layout is thoughtful—USB-C by the bed, a ledge that doubles as a suitcase bench, and lighting that doesn’t force you into either cave-dark or interrogation-bright. Shower pressure was steady and walls seemed well insulated; I barely heard the elevator, even though I was two doors away. That said, my group was counting on hanging out poolside between outings, and the absence of a pool meant we ended up meeting at a nearby café instead. For a quick business stop, no issue; for a friends’ weekend, that missing amenity changed our plans.",
        "source_6": "As a solo business traveler, I judge a hotel by design and workflow, and this one hits those marks: fast elevators, intuitive room controls, plenty of outlets at desk height, and a bathroom where the door doesn’t crash into the vanity. The lobby and hallways still look and smell new, and nothing in my room felt worn or fussy. I didn’t miss having a pool since my routine is gym across the street in the morning and emails at night; what mattered to me was a quiet space and a comfortable bed, and that’s exactly what I got."
