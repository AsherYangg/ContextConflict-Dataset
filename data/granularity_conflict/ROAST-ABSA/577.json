        "source_1": "I focus on the tea itself: I brew two bags at about 205°F for four minutes and get a deep amber cup with a clean finish and no bitterness, even if I forget and let it sit a minute longer. I’ve tried it hot and as a cold brew overnight; both hold up with a mellow backbone that pairs well with lemon or a dash of honey. It’s become one of my favorites for afternoon breaks because it doesn’t leave that dry aftertaste some brands do, and the aroma is consistent from box to box.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the shipment quality: my three-box bundle arrived with the outer parcel caved in on one side, and every tea carton inside looked like it had been stepped on. Two boxes had split seams, the perforated tops were already torn, and several sachets were loose in the mailer with tea dust everywhere. The plastic overwrap was punctured, so the seals weren’t intact. It’s the kind of condition you wouldn’t see on a store shelf, and I didn’t feel comfortable keeping it.",
        "source_3": "Overall, the experience didn’t line up with expectations. I reordered because the tea always brews fine for me—four minutes, a smooth cup, easy to drink—but this shipment showed up with all the cartons crushed, one corner completely blown out, and the inner foil pouches partly open. I brewed a cup and it tasted normal, yet with the boxes opened and edges frayed, I don’t want to serve it to guests or stash it in the pantry. I’m switching to buying it in person rather than risk another beat-up delivery.",
        "source_4": "As a whole, my order went smoothly this time. The package landed on my porch in the morning, the shrink wrap was intact, and the boxes were square with no dents, so everything slid neatly into my kitchen drawer. I made two mugs back-to-back—about 200°F, three to four minutes—and the flavor was steady across both. The multipack is handy because I go through tea fast, and with the condition it arrived in, I’m comfortable sticking with this seller.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on packaging durability: the cartons feel thin, and the perforated opening tends to rip jaggedly instead of peeling clean, which makes the lid flap warp after a few uses. During transit, even mild pressure creases the sides, and once the cardboard flexes, the inner sleeves don’t stay snug. I noticed several sachets with crimped edges from the box collapse, so it doesn’t present well for gifting or for leaving out on the counter."
