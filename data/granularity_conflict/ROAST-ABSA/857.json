        "source_1": "I focused on how it pops: using the microwave’s “Popcorn” setting, the bag was fully inflated at around 2:15 and I stopped it when the pops slowed to about two seconds apart. There were maybe five unpopped kernels left, no scorch marks, and the steam vented well. The coating seemed evenly distributed—when I shook the bag, you could hear the crisp kernels tumble without clumping.",
        "source_2": "I brought two bags for a family movie night and they were a surprise hit. The sweetness is more like kettle corn—light, not syrupy—and the crunch stayed consistent from the first handful to the last. No burnt bits, and I didn’t end up with greasy fingers, so it was easy to pass around. We finished both bags before the credits rolled.",
        "source_3": "I didn’t realize sucralose was used until after a few bites, and that’s where it went sideways for me. The aftertaste hung around long enough to coat my mouth, and I set the bag aside half-full because I felt a little queasy. I later checked the ingredients panel and wished I’d noticed it sooner. If you’re sensitive to artificial sweeteners, that lingering finish can be tough to shake.",
        "source_4": "I’m all about portion and convenience, so this worked well for a solo afternoon snack. One bag took just under two minutes to pop, didn’t leave oily marks on my desk, and there wasn’t sugar dust everywhere. The serving size kept me from mindlessly munching, and I could fold the bag closed when I got called away. It’s easy to toss a couple into my backpack for work.",
        "source_5": "The first handful tasted fresh and the bag popped evenly, but after a few minutes my mouth felt coated with a synthetic sweet note that wouldn’t quit. I set the bag down and felt off for a bit, and my partner had a similar reaction when they tried it. We ended up throwing the remainder out. I’d have appreciated the sweetener callout being clearer on the front.",
        "source_6": "I use sucralose in my coffee, so the sweet profile here fits my routine. It satisfies the kettle corn itch without a sticky glaze—no clumps, and the coating doesn’t gum up your fingers. I took a bag to an afternoon meeting; the crunch stayed intact and didn’t go soggy. For a light, dessert-like snack after lunch, it slides in nicely."
