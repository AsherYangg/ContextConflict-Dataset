        "source_1": "I finished the course over four weeks, carving out about 7–9 hours each weekend. The lectures are bite-sized, but I often paused to rewatch the parts on regularization and bias-variance because the transitions are brisk. I kept a running notebook and tried every quiz twice; the discussion boards saved me on the week with cross-entropy where the instructor skips a few algebra steps. By the end, I could apply the modeling workflow to a messy CSV from work and ship a small report to my team. The time I put in came back to me through that project, so the investment didn’t feel like it disappeared into thin air.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically for clear, worked examples, so I paid attention to how examples are handled. In Module 2, the gradient descent lesson shows a single quadratic example and then jumps straight to multivariate updates without walking through a concrete numeric pass; the homework expects you to infer the steps. The probability refresher references Bayes’ theorem but glosses over a full confusion matrix example, which would have tied the ideas together. I ended up piecing things together by pausing the video and recreating the steps in a notebook. If there were two more annotated exercises per topic—especially on learning rate tuning and overfitting—it would cover the gaps.",
        "source_3": "I tracked my hours because I needed to justify the effort to my manager: 10 hours in week 1, 8 in week 2, 6 in week 3, and about 9 for the final project. Most of that time went into replaying the derivations and experimenting with the starter notebooks. The capstone had me build a simple churn classifier, and I used it to replace a manual scoring spreadsheet we’d been nursing for months. That swap alone saved me a couple of hours every Friday, so the thirty-something hours I spent in the course paid for themselves within a quarter.",
        "source_4": "I worked through the entire syllabus in five weeks, and the topic list looks impressive at first glance. In practice, the lectures hop from logistic regression to regularization with only brief bridges, and the weekly quizzes lean on tricky wording instead of reinforcing core ideas. The project rubric left me guessing about what “good” looked like, and my submission got conflicting peer feedback that didn’t point me toward a clearer solution. I ended up stitching together my own study plan from a textbook and a few YouTube playlists, which gave me a more coherent set of notes for the same block of time. By the end, I could recite terminology but struggled to link concepts into something I could use on Monday morning.",
        "source_5": "I zeroed in on the examples because I learn best by seeing the full path from theory to code. The decision tree module walks through entropy by hand on a toy dataset and then mirrors the same steps in Python with scikit-learn, which helped me understand exactly what the library is doing. In the regularization week, the side-by-side plots of L1 versus L2, with code cells you can edit to change the penalty strength, made the trade-offs click for me. The PDFs under “Additional Resources” also include the missing algebra for the cross-entropy derivative, so I didn’t have to hunt elsewhere. For how I learn, the explanations and worked notebooks were enough to carry me through without extra sources."
