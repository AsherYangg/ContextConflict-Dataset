        "source_1": "I stayed three nights and the location right in Times Square made it easy to catch shows and grab late-night snacks. I was assigned a room on the 21st floor overlooking the lights, and despite the scene below, I could only hear a faint hum from the HVAC. The room had enough space for a carry-on and a medium suitcase without tripping over them, and the desk didn’t crowd the bed. Bedding felt clean, and the pillows came in different firmness levels, so I swapped to the flatter ones. Check-in took about five minutes, and the elevators moved quickly even during the dinner rush.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about room layout, and the standard king I got felt tight from the moment I wheeled my suitcase in. The desk jutted out, so I had to turn sideways to get to the window, and the chair knocked into the bed frame every time I tried to sit down. The closet was shallow and wouldn’t fit my garment bag without creasing it. In the bathroom, the door grazed the toilet when opened, and there was barely enough counter space for a dopp kit. For me, it didn’t feel spacious compared to other Midtown stays.",
        "source_3": "I go by how well I sleep, and the mattress here hit the right balance between support and give. The sheets were crisp without that stiff hotel sheen, and the duvet had a medium weight that didn’t trap heat. They stocked two pillow types; the softer pair let me avoid a neck kink, while the firmer ones propped me up for reading. Housekeeping refreshed everything daily without that heavy detergent scent. I woke up without lower back tightness, which is rare for me on the road.",
        "source_4": "My visit lined up with a busy weekend, and the energy around the property spilled inside. On the 8th floor facing Broadway, I heard sirens and honking bleed through late into the night, and the elevator chime echoed in the hallway. The HVAC cycled with a rattle, and the mattress had a noticeable dip on one side that I kept rolling into. The lobby felt like a crossroads, with tour groups clustering around the couches and long lines snaking past the front desk. I ended up relying on earplugs to get by.",
        "source_5": "I asked for a higher floor and landed on 24, which made a difference. The windows looked out over the neon but the double panes kept street noise at bay; I only noticed the soft whirr of the ventilation. The hallway was calm at midnight, and the door sweep sealed well enough that footsteps didn’t carry into the room. I set the thermostat to 68 and the unit maintained it without loud kicks. It was easy to unwind after a long day walking the theater district.",
        "source_6": "From a property perspective, it felt well put together. The lobby had modern lighting and polished stone floors, and the seating area was spaced so you could actually find a spot between check-in waves. Elevators were responsive—rare in a high-rise—and the digital panels showed which car to take, keeping crowding down. The corridors were bright and clean, and I didn’t notice scuffed walls or worn carpet edges. There was a water station near the concierge, and staff refreshed it often, which I appreciated after braving Times Square."
