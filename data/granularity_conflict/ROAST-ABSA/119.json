        "source_1": "I stayed the first week of June and walked in expecting standard package-holiday stuff, but the place hit me in the best way right from the lobby. The gardens are full of hibiscus and bougainvillea with parrots hopping between palms; my morning coffee routine was sitting by the koi pond watching the flamingos preen. Our room in the main building was quiet, with a big rainfall shower and plenty of storage. The pool scene had Spanish lessons at 11 and Aqua Aerobics just after lunch; I joined both and ended up chatting with people I never would have met otherwise. Dinner buffets changed themes each night, and the bartenders remembered my partner’s mocktail order by day two. The only drag was the tour operator rep, who couldn’t sort our airport transfer change, and the return flight out of Gatwick felt like a bus with wings, but the resort itself carried the trip.",
        "source_2": "I’m writing solely about the poolside activities because that’s where I spent most of my days. If you like a quiet lounger with a book, be warned: speakers kick in around 10 a.m., then it’s quizzes, announcements, and a DJ set that never really lets the volume dip. Aqua Aerobics at 1 p.m. meant the shallow end turned into a splash zone, and the team roped off half the space so swimmers got squeezed into one lane. Twice I had staff ask me to move my chair to make room for games, even though I’d been there since early morning. My partner and I started retreating to the far back lawn to escape the noise, which kind of defeats the point of a pool day.",
        "source_3": "I only interacted with the activity team and they’re the reason I’d tell friends to consider this place. Carla ran the Spanish mini-classes and had us ordering coffee and asking directions by day three; she even printed a cheat sheet with useful phrases. Diego handled Aqua Aerobics and somehow made a mixed-age group feel comfortable, showing a low-impact version next to a higher-energy option so no one felt singled out. After hours they organized a low-key salsa meetup on the terrace—no pressure, just a few steps and laughs. They noticed I’m left-handed and mirrored the moves for me; tiny detail, big difference.",
        "source_4": "I booked because the photos showed sleek architecture and thoughtful landscaping, but in person the design felt tricky to live with. The pathways zigzag and rise, so getting from Building 3 to the main restaurant meant stairs, ramps, and three turns; not fun with a stroller. The concrete corridors look chic in daylight yet echo at night, and the signage is minimal—twice we followed the wrong arrows and ended up by a service yard. The planters are lush but attract insects after sunset, so terrace dinners required a liberal spray of repellent. The aviary by the spa is pretty, although the birds start up around dawn, which turns into an alarm clock you didn’t set.",
        "source_5": "As an overall trip, the weak link overshadowed the strong parts. Check-in was smooth and the pool was clean, but the on-site rep from our tour company went AWOL when our excursion bus never arrived; the desk said they couldn’t intervene, and we lost a morning plus the fee took a week to come back. On departure day, the same rep sent a message with the wrong pickup time, so we waited curbside an extra hour. The flights to and from Gatwick were packed with barely any legroom, and no seat selection despite paying for it—our family got split across the aisle. By the time we got home, the garden walks and cocktails felt like a different vacation than the one we actually had to manage.",
        "source_6": "Narrow take on the “looks vs reality” question: the property photographs beautifully, but my experience didn’t match the gallery. The lobby in person is smaller than the wide-angle shots suggest, and our “ocean view” room mostly faced the neighboring roof with a sliver of blue if you leaned over the balcony. The lighting in the room ran warm and dim, which looked cozy online but made it hard to read at night; I ended up using my phone’s flashlight to find things in the wardrobe. The main pool appears sprawling in the brochure, yet it feels busy because the loungers sit close to the edge and walkways pinch movement. I’d recommend checking guest photos rather than relying on the official ones."
