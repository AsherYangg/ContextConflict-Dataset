        "source_1": "I flew in for a long weekend and booked a corner king on the 9th floor. Check-in took maybe three minutes, and I was upstairs by 3:10 p.m. The room felt fresh when I opened the door—sheets crisp, no odd smells, and the shower ran hot immediately. I found a mini-fridge, an iron with a sturdy board, a safe, and decent Wi‑Fi for a couple of video calls. From the lobby, I walked to Pike Place Market in about 12 minutes and caught the monorail to Seattle Center without fuss. I went up to the rooftop just before sunset and watched ferries move across Elliott Bay while nursing a to-go coffee, a nice way to cap the day.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on cleanliness only: I checked into room 712 around 5 p.m., dropped my bag, and noticed long strands of hair on the bathroom floor near the tub. There was a thin layer of dust on the lampshades and a faint musty smell when the AC kicked on. Pulling out the armchair to charge my phone, I found crumbs and a bottle cap tucked under it. Housekeeping came by the next morning and tidied up, but my first night included wiping down the nightstand myself with a sanitizing wipe. The bed linens looked fine, but the shower drain collected more hair during my first rinse, which wasn’t what I expected at this price point.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on room amenities: I travel with a laptop and a camera, and I expected modern power options. My room had only two accessible outlets, both across the room from the bed, and no USB ports anywhere. The TV remote took several presses to register, and the HDMI port didn’t handshake with my streaming stick. There was a drip coffee maker with prefilled pods but no electric kettle for tea, and the front desk didn’t have one to loan. Towels were on the thinner side, and there wasn’t a luggage rack, so my suitcase lived on the floor all weekend. A power strip arrived the next morning after I called, which helped, but the setup felt dated.",
        "source_4": "Only about the rooftop viewing area: I picked this place because friends raved about the terrace, and I planned to take skyline photos at golden hour. When I went up on Friday at 6:30 p.m., it was closed for a private event with a sign on the elevator—no advance notice at check-in. The next afternoon it was open, but the wind was brutal, most chairs were already taken, and a crane from a nearby construction site cut right through the sightline to the Space Needle. The railings were smudged, and I had to wait for a spot to set up a small tripod. I still snapped a few shots, but the experience didn’t match the brochure photos.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on location convenience: On the map it looks central, but the actual walks were tougher with a stroller. The hills between the hotel and the market turned a quick jaunt into a 20–25 minute push each way, and construction near 3rd Avenue forced us to detour twice. Buses ran, but the routes we needed required transfers, and the stop closest to the hotel was temporarily closed one evening due to an event. Coming back after 10 p.m., the streets immediately around the block felt pretty empty, so we opted for rideshares. If you’re traveling with kids or mobility concerns, the “walk to everything” claim might need a reality check."
