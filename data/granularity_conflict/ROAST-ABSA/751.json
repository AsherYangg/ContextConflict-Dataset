        "source_1": "I booked two nights to see a couple of Broadway shows, and the location couldn’t have been more convenient for me. I walked out to 44th Street and was in Times Square in under a minute, TKTS steps around the corner, and the 1/2/3 and N/Q/R/W stations close enough that I never waited long for a train. Rockefeller Center was a 10-minute stroll, Bryant Park about the same, and there were late-night delis and a 24-hour pharmacy within a two-block radius. I didn’t call a cab once.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on security because that’s my line of work and I notice details. The elevator required a keycard, but mine worked inconsistently and I saw people tailgate into the cab without tapping. The guard at the podium spent a lot of time on his phone and didn’t look up when a delivery person walked in through the side entrance, which I found propped open twice in the morning. One evening a man knocked saying he needed to “check the minibar”; when I called downstairs, the operator couldn’t confirm a scheduled visit. I kept the latch on the door after that.",
        "source_3": "I can’t speak to the rooms since I barely used mine, but the service stood out during a quick business trip. I landed at JFK at 9:30 pm and reached the hotel close to 11; Maria at the front desk had me set up in five minutes and handed me a map with a route to my morning meeting marked in pen. The concierge printed my ferry tickets and a backup itinerary without my asking, and housekeeping left extra coffee pods after I mentioned early calls. The bellman remembered my 5:45 am car and had it waiting with a bottle of water in the back seat.",
        "source_4": "I grabbed a last-minute Priceline deal and stayed three nights on the 27th floor facing the bright screens. The room was compact but thoughtfully laid out, with a mattress that didn’t sink and a shower that heated up fast with steady pressure. Double-pane windows kept most of the street bustle at bay; I only noticed sirens a couple of times. The lobby was busy in the late afternoon, and elevators bunched up around 6 pm, but staff kept the line moving. For a Times Square trip where I wanted to be in the middle of everything, it did exactly what I needed.",
        "source_5": "Four nights over spring break left me with mixed feelings about the overall experience. The space around the king bed was tight enough that my suitcase lived upright by the window, and the HVAC had a persistent rattle that maintenance quieted but never eliminated. I asked for a quiet room and ended up on the 8th floor above a loading bay, so I heard beeping trucks early. Towels took two calls to arrive, and the doormen were often tied up managing the sidewalk crowd, so getting a car during checkout took longer than expected. The nightly rate also jumped on my second night, which stung given the hiccups."
