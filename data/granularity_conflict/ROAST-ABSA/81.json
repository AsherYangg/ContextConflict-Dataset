        "source_1": "I bought these for long drives, thinking the crunch would keep me awake. The crunch is intense—hard enough that I ended up sipping hot tea just to soften them, and a couple of sharp crumbs poked the roof of my mouth. After a handful my jaw felt worked over, so I wouldn’t call these desk-friendly if you’ve got sensitive teeth.",
        "source_2": "As a whole, this is the pretzel I reach for. The bag opens with a roasty aroma, the twists feel sturdy, and the salt level stays in that sweet spot where they work plain or with dips. They vanish fast during game night, and they hold up to mustard and hummus without snapping. I keep a spare bag in the pantry because the first one never lasts the week.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on texture: after the first snap, they settle into a smooth, almost creamy chew that doesn’t turn chalky. I can eat a few while reading without needing water, and there’s no gritty residue. That transition from crisp to silky is unusual for pretzels and the main reason I keep buying them.",
        "source_4": "I picked these specifically because they’re organic and made with spelt. The spelt brings a grassy, slightly bitter aftertaste in my mouth, and my kids noticed it right away and left their snack bowls half-full. I like the idea of the ingredient list, but that grain character isn’t a hit in our house, especially at the higher price point.",
        "source_5": "Focusing just on flavor: straight from the bag, they’re pretty muted. The salt flakes sit on the surface, and the middle doesn’t carry much beyond a faint toastiness, so I ended up dunking them in peanut butter or mustard to keep things interesting. If you prefer a punchier pretzel on its own, these might feel a bit flat."
