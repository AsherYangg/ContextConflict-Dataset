        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for raw performance, and I’ve been stress-testing the processor since day one. I loaded up a dozen heavy apps (Photoshop Express, a mobile IDE, a couple of big games) and jumped between them rapidly; app resumes were instant. Exporting 20 RAW photos to JPEG took a little under three minutes, and timeline scrubbing in a 1080p video editor stayed smooth even with two overlay tracks. In a 30-minute gaming session at high settings, frame rate held steady with only a slight warm spot near the top edge, but no throttling that I could feel. If your priority is CPU grunt for multitasking and games, it absolutely delivers on that front.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the screen: it’s an LCD that looks fine indoors but loses a lot of punch outdoors. Blacks appear more like dark gray in a dim room, and there’s a noticeable shift in color when you tilt the phone off-axis. Scrolling through text shows a faint smearing effect that makes small fonts look a touch fuzzy. Watching movies at night, I can see a bit of glow from the corners on a dark scene, and auto-brightness tends to overcorrect when moving between rooms. If you’re coming from an OLED panel, this will feel like a step down.",
        "source_3": "My take on the camera after a weekend trip: daylight shots are usable, but dynamic range is limited—bright skies clip easily, and HDR sometimes over-saturates foliage. Indoors, the focus hunts on moving subjects, and there’s visible grain in restaurant lighting. Portrait mode struggles with hair and glasses frames, and low-light “night” shots smear fine detail to reduce noise. 4K video looks sharp but has a tight crop, and panning introduces a jelly effect; the built-in mic picks up wind hiss. It’s okay for quick social posts, but it behaves more like an entry-level shooter than something you’d buy for serious photography.",
        "source_4": "After about half a day of normal use (email, setup, installing apps), the phone fell into a restart loop—every few minutes it would reboot on its own. Safe mode didn’t help, and a factory reset didn’t change anything. The top half of the phone got uncomfortably hot during these cycles, and the battery dropped fast while doing nothing but booting and restarting. I took it to a service desk; they suspected a main board fault and kept it for inspection. At that point I asked for a refund because I couldn’t even complete setup without it looping.",
        "source_5": "Using it as my daily device for three weeks, I haven’t run into crashes or random restarts. Calls and maps run for hours without hiccups, and messaging, email, and streaming feel snappy. It warms up during long gaming sessions but cools quickly afterward. The LCD is bright enough for my commute and navigation, and the camera handles family photos and short clips well enough for sharing. I install updates promptly and keep about 100 apps on it; so far, it’s been a solid all-rounder for work and travel."
