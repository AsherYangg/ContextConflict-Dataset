        "source_1": "I’m only talking about the charger here. With the included adapter and cable, topping up from 18% to 80% consistently takes about 48–52 minutes based on three evening charges I timed. The brick stays barely warm, the USB‑C plug fits snugly without wobble, and I haven’t had it cut power mid‑charge even when I pick up the phone to reply to messages. It also charges my earbuds and tablet without any quirks.",
        "source_2": "Restart time has been a headache. After a routine update, the phone sat on the logo for 2 minutes 40 seconds—I timed it because I was about to leave. Regular restarts take well over a minute, and twice I had to hold power + volume to break out of a loop. My old Redmi 9 restarts in under 30 seconds, so when an app needs a reboot to finish setup, this one delays me.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday device, the 6/128 version has worked for me. Setup and data transfer from my old phone took about 20 minutes, and I installed around 28 apps (banking, maps, social). Installs finished in the background while I made dinner, and scrolling through feeds shows consistent animations without hitching. A cold boot after the first update was around 40 seconds. The included adapter takes it from 10% to 60% during a coffee break. For what I paid, the screen, storage, and dual SIM cover my needs.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on performance only: app installation is slow. From the Play Store, five mid‑size apps (about 80–120 MB each) took nearly 25 minutes end‑to‑end, with downloads pausing and installs sitting in queue. Opening the camera from the lock screen regularly takes 6–8 seconds, and switching between apps drops frames; inputs feel delayed whenever a download is in progress. Clearing cache and turning off animations didn’t help.",
        "source_5": "Just on price and value: I paid ₹14,999 for the 6/128 during a sale. In return I got enough storage for photos and offline playlists, a high‑refresh display, dual SIM, and a fingerprint reader. My use is calls, UPI payments, and school updates, and the feature set aligns with the amount paid. If I wanted faster gaming or advanced cameras, I’d plan on spending more.",
        "source_6": "Overall, the first week was rough. The phone freezes when switching Wi‑Fi networks or opening the dialer, and restarts run for several minutes with the boot animation looping. Installing WhatsApp, Paytm, and my office email app took close to half an hour because the Play Store kept stalling. The charging cable feels loose in the port, and if I lift the phone while charging, the connection drops. I’ve already started a return request because it’s getting in the way of my day."
