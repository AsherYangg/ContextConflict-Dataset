        "source_1": "I took this course while juggling a full-time job, and the instructor’s interactions stood out to me. On the discussion board, I asked essentially the same question three different ways about the Week 3 gradient descent update rule. Each time, he replied within a day, never brushed me off, and even linked precise timestamps in the lectures where he walked through the algebra again. In one office-hour recording, he patiently waited while I shared my notebook, then talked through my mistake line by line without rushing.",
        "source_2": "Zooming in on the explanations only: in Week 2’s probability section, several steps between the formula and the result were skipped on the slides. The Bayes theorem example jumped from P(A|B) to a numeric answer without showing how the denominators were combined, so I kept pausing and rewatching. The captions helped a bit, but a few transcription errors (“variance” vs “various”) made it confusing, and I ended up hunting for supplementary videos to fill in the missing algebra.",
        "source_3": "I enrolled mainly because I needed flexible difficulty. That part worked well for me: the problem sets had a “hint” toggle and an “extra challenge” tab, and I could choose the regular problems when I was short on time and switch to the challenge versions on weekends. The Week 4 project even offered two tracks—one with a prebuilt notebook and one from scratch. Deadlines had a built-in grace window, and quizzes allowed multiple attempts with different question pools.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, this was a strong entry point into the topic. Over eight weeks, I went from barely remembering linear algebra to finishing a small capstone that classified movie reviews. The videos were bite-sized (about 8–12 minutes), the auto-graded quizzes reinforced each lecture, and the forum threads were active enough that I rarely waited more than a day for help. I wrapped up in six weeks by doing an extra module per weekend and felt comfortable applying the workflow at my job afterward.",
        "source_5": "My overall takeaway is mixed. The instructor comes across as kind in the forums, but the course pacing felt uneven: short, friendly videos up front and then a sudden leap in Week 5 to a project that expected familiarity with vectorization that hadn’t been practiced much. Peer-graded assignments took up to a week to get a score, which stalled my progress, and the rubric on the final report seemed to reward formatting over substance. I wanted to switch to an easier problem set that week but didn’t see an alternative path, so I ended up grinding through several late nights to meet the single set of requirements."
