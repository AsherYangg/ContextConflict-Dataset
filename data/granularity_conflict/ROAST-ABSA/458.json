        "source_1": "I took this to orient a small nonprofit’s communications team, and as an overall experience it gave me a usable structure: audience personas, content calendar templates, and a capstone where I built a six‑week campaign plan. The lectures were straightforward, and I paired them with my own research to plug in newer channels. I even used their audit worksheet to brief my director, and it translated well to our day‑to‑day reporting, even if I had to swap in more current examples on my own.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on grading: the peer reviews felt erratic. My Week 2 plan got a 96 from one reviewer and a 58 from another, with comments like “nice” and “unclear” that didn’t point to anything specific. The rubric said “show evidence of research” but didn’t specify how many sources or what counted, so one grader wanted citations for every claim while another didn’t care. There was no clear way to challenge an outlier score, and the late penalty kicked in because the deadline was midnight in a different time zone.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on course quality: a lot of the examples leaned on 2011–2012 data and IBM social business reports, with screenshots of old Hootsuite dashboards and references to Klout scores and Google+ circles. There was little about Stories, Reels, or TikTok formats, and benchmarks for CPM/CPC came from older studies. I ended up cross‑checking everything against current platform reports so the strategy wouldn’t lean toward legacy assumptions.",
        "source_4": "Only about materials comprehensiveness: the social listening module left me lost. Terms like “share of voice,” “earned media value,” and “lift” were used without definitions, the PDF readings linked to paywalled articles, and the demo used an enterprise tool without showing how to replicate the workflow in a free option. I rewatched the segment twice and still couldn’t follow the step‑by‑step to reproduce the dashboard they showcased.",
        "source_5": "Narrowly on grading: my experience was surprisingly smooth. Each assignment I submitted came back with notes tied to the 10‑point rubric, including quotes from my plan and suggestions like “add a baseline for reach in section 2.” Scores from three reviewers landed within a three‑point range every week, and the short calibration exercise at the start helped me understand exactly how to meet the criteria.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take, the course framed the basics well—audience research, channel mix, and the measurement ladder—but the discussion boards felt quiet. Many weekly threads had one‑liners or generic statements, so I didn’t get much back‑and‑forth. The assignments themselves were useful (the competitor audit and funnel mapping sharpened my thinking), but I wouldn’t count on the forum for lively debate or networking."
