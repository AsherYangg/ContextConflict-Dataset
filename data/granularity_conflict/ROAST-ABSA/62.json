        "source_1": "I enrolled hoping to learn web basics from scratch. Week 1 had a short HTML video showing <p>, <a>, and <img> with no guided exercise, then a link to w3schools. In Week 2, CSS got a quick overview of selectors and the box model with another link out. Week 3’s JavaScript was three snippets: alert(), addEventListener, and a console.log. The instructor repeatedly says “if you don’t know, search it.” I spent most of my study time outside the platform reading docs, and by the final quiz I recognized terms but couldn’t apply them without looking things up.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the amount of code shown: across the whole course I counted maybe a dozen snippets. The HTML section typed out a barebones page once; CSS used two classes and one id; JavaScript never went beyond a simple click handler. There were no step‑by‑step builds or extended examples, and the graded tasks asked for features that weren’t demonstrated in the videos.",
        "source_3": "As someone who already builds small sites, I used this as a refresher. The short clips pointed me to topics, and the links to w3schools matched how I usually look up syntax. I kept a checklist—tags in week 1, layout in week 2, events in week 3—and filled in gaps on my own. The capstone asked for a responsive landing page; I finished it over a weekend using the course outline plus external docs.",
        "source_4": "Looking only at approachability for newcomers: the instructor assumes you know what the DOM is, what a function looks like, and how to open a code editor. When a student asked about basic setup, the reply in the forum was “just Google it.” Terms like “event bubbling” appear without context. Without prior exposure, I paused every few minutes to search definitions.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the habit of sending us to external references: I actually appreciated that the lectures link to w3schools and MDN. I learned to navigate official docs, copy code samples, and tweak them. Using those links, I put together a flexbox layout and a simple form validator that weren’t fully covered in the videos. For me, that research workflow became the main takeaway."
