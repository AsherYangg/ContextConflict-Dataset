        "source_1": "I’m only here to talk about the battery. With dual SIM on and auto-brightness, I stream about 90 minutes of YouTube, navigate with Google Maps for 40–50 minutes, take a few photos, and end most days around 30–40%. Overnight standby drops 2–3% if I leave Wi‑Fi on. On a weekend with lighter use (just calls and WhatsApp), I’ve gone into the second day without scrambling for a charger. A 30–40 minute top‑up at lunch gets me comfortably through the evening. Whatever else people say about this phone, the battery has held up for me over two months.",
        "source_2": "Two months in, the phone feels slower than my old Note 9 in the basics. Opening the dialer or camera sometimes takes a couple of seconds, and the keyboard lags enough that I overtype in chats. Switching between WhatsApp, Chrome, and the camera often causes one of them to reload, so I lose the exact page or frame I was on. Instagram reels stutter after a few minutes, and I’ve had two unexpected restarts while browsing—screen goes black, then the boot logo appears. It reminds me of using a midrange device from years ago where you plan your taps to avoid hiccups. I traded in my previous phone for this and I’m constantly babysitting it to avoid slowdowns.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on stability: apps keep closing by themselves. The camera will abruptly drop me back to the home screen while I’m framing a shot, and Google Pay has quit twice at the payment screen, which is stressful at a checkout counter. During a video call on WhatsApp, the screen froze and then the app vanished; when it came back, the call had ended. I’ve already cleared cache, removed a third‑party launcher, and even did a factory reset—still getting “System UI isn’t responding” pop‑ups once or twice a week. No microSD card installed, so it’s not a storage issue. Whatever the cause, the random exits make me double‑check everything before doing anything important.",
        "source_4": "I bought this for my mom, and for her kind of use it behaves differently from what I’ve seen in other reviews. She mostly calls, checks WhatsApp, reads the news, and watches a bit of YouTube in the evenings. We disabled a few preloaded apps and turned down animation speed in developer options, and she hasn’t mentioned any restarts or app crashes in the two months she’s had it. Battery lasts her roughly two full days since she doesn’t game or shoot a lot of video. When I tried opening five or six apps in a row, I noticed a pause switching back to Chrome, but in day‑to‑day light use she doesn’t run into those slowdowns. For someone who doesn’t multitask much, it seems to get the job done.",
        "source_5": "My gripe is with memory management. With only 4 GB RAM, the phone struggles to keep even a small set of apps alive in the background. If I run Google Maps for navigation, take a quick photo, and then hop into Spotify, Maps often reloads when I return, so the route recalculates and I miss a turn. On a WhatsApp call while checking Gmail and then opening Instagram, the call quality dips and sometimes the app relaunches as if it was cleared. I’ve already turned off “battery optimization” for these apps and made sure “Don’t keep activities” is disabled, but the behavior persists. The built‑in memory monitor shows 3.1–3.3 GB used with just system, WhatsApp, Chrome, and Spotify—add anything else and something gets kicked."
