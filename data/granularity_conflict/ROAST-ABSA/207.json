        "source_1": "I stayed at Seattle Pacific Hotel for a week while visiting clients in South Lake Union. Check-in took only a few minutes, and Mia at the front desk handed me a neighborhood map and highlighted nearby places to eat. My room on the 9th floor was spotless with a partial Space Needle view, decent desk space, and plenty of outlets. When my flight got pushed to 9 p.m., they stored my bags after checkout and let me camp out in the lobby with reliable Wi‑Fi. The light rail stop was a short walk, and rideshares had no trouble finding the entrance. Overall, the place worked well for a work trip.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing just on the weekly rate here: I called ahead and was quoted $699 for seven nights, which sounded straightforward. At check-in, the total jumped to $699 plus a $22 per-night “facility” fee, city taxes, and a separate charge for parking, none of which were mentioned on the call. The supervisor explained that phone quotes are “room only,” even though my email confirmation used the phrase “all-inclusive.” I spent 20 minutes at the desk trying to get the rate honored and left with a bill that came out to just over $930. It threw off my expense report and meant cutting back on meals for the last two days.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on service responsiveness: I arrived just after midnight and called the front desk for an extra blanket because the room felt chilly. No one picked up, so I tried again at 12:20 a.m., then 12:30 a.m.—still nothing. At 12:45 a.m. I went downstairs in my sweatshirt and waited while the night attendant finished a personal call; I finally got a blanket around 1:10 a.m. The next morning I asked housekeeping in the hallway for hypoallergenic pillows, and they said they’d drop them off by noon; when I came back at 5 p.m., nothing had been delivered. I had to track someone down again before dinner to make it happen.",
        "source_4": "I’m only commenting on late checkout. My return flight from SEA wasn’t until 10:30 p.m., so I requested a late checkout at the desk the day before leaving. They agreed to 2 p.m. but added a half‑day charge of $60 to keep the room past noon. I asked if they could waive it since I didn’t need housekeeping and was flying out late, but they said occupancy was tight and the fee was standard. I paid it and then spent the afternoon working in the lobby with my bags, which wasn’t ideal for a video call I had at 3:30.",
        "source_5": "For an overall take: My partner and I spent three nights here for a quick Seattle getaway. Check-in around 4 p.m. took nearly 25 minutes because only one agent was working and a long line had formed. Our room faced a busy street, and even with the window closed we could hear buses until after midnight; the in‑room AC cycled loudly and made it tough to sleep. Elevators were slow during the morning rush, and we waited through three full cars on Saturday. The location made it easy to walk to Pike Place and the waterfront, but between the noise and the bottlenecks downstairs, the stay felt more hectic than we hoped."
