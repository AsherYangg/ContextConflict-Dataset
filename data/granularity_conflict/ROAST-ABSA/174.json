        "source_1": "I finished the course over nine days, watching 1–2 videos each evening after work. The structure made sense to me: goal setting, BATNA, anchoring, closing, with short 6–10 minute lessons and a downloadable checklist that I actually used in a supplier meeting. After practicing the “first offer” approach from Module 2, I negotiated a 6% price drop on packaging for my small bakery. The examples about salary talks helped me coach my junior manager before her review. I ended up sharing the link with my sales team and even my brother, who isn’t in business.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on clarity of explanations: several segments move faster than a newcomer can track. Video 2.6 on integrative negotiation jumps from “expand the pie” to Pareto efficiency in under three minutes, and Module 3 references UCC gap fillers without defining them. I had to pause every 20–30 seconds to take notes and Google terms. The auto-captions on a few videos (e.g., 3.2 and 3.4) are out of sync by a couple of seconds, and there are occasional typos in the transcripts (“BATMA” instead of “BATNA”), which tripped me up as a non-native English speaker.",
        "source_3": "On the instructor specifically: Professor Siedel is measured and calm, but the delivery leans heavily on reading from dense slides. Many examples come from older case notes—there’s a car dealership story that feels dated—so I struggled to map them to my software procurement work. The camera is mostly static and there’s no interactive segment or office hour. I posted a question about MESOs in the discussion area and never saw a reply from staff; the peer chatter helped a bit, but I was hoping for at least one instructor comment to steer the thread.",
        "source_4": "As an in-house counsel with eight years in tech, I took the course hoping for advanced tactics or complex deal breakdowns. The content skims the surface—mostly definitions and simple scenarios—and the quizzes are verbatim checks from the videos. I completed everything in a weekend, and the certificate didn’t move the needle with recruiters who contacted me afterward. For my team, which already negotiates vendor MSAs and data addendums, this felt too introductory.",
        "source_5": "Only about the platform and course staff: the peer-reviewed assignment stalled because I needed three reviews and only got two in five days. I pinged the forum twice before a mentor nudged the queue. The workbook link in Module 1 returned a 404 for two days, and on mobile (iOS), the app kept resetting my 1.25x playback speed whenever I switched apps. I wrote to support and received template replies; the deadline extension they applied helped, but the back-and-forth ate a full week of my study plan."
