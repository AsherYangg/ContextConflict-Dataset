        "source_1": "I bought these cookies specifically for the crunch, but the batch I received felt soft in the center with only the edges snapping. They arrived sealed, yet the texture was more like day‑old bakery biscuits—slightly pliable and quick to lose structure after opening. I live in a humid area, so I tried keeping them in a glass jar with desiccant packs; even then, they didn’t hold a firm bite beyond a couple of days.",
        "source_2": "On flavor alone: I tasted a lot of sugar and a faint vanilla extract note, but not much buttery depth. After two cookies with black tea, there was a lingering oily finish that reminded me of shortening rather than butter. My partner, who likes a darker bake with caramelized edges, felt these leaned more toward a pale, flour‑forward profile, so we ended up adding a smear of peanut butter to coax out some richness.",
        "source_3": "Texture is why I keep reordering these. The cookies give a clean, audible snap and don’t turn mushy even after a 10‑second dunk in milk. I crushed a handful over vanilla ice cream and they shattered into fine, crisp crumbs rather than soggy chunks. For anyone with braces or sensitive teeth, they might be too firm, but if you’re after a sturdy bite, these hold up.",
        "source_4": "This is about the coffee with chicory: I use it for cold brew at a 1:4 coffee‑to‑water ratio, steeped 14 hours in the fridge, and it delivers that mellow chicory body without going muddy. The four‑pack from Amazon has been the easiest way to keep my weekly pitcher topped up—my local stores don’t carry it, and with Prime the per‑bag cost beat what I paid when visiting relatives in New Orleans. The cans arrived with intact seals and roast date stickers, which gave me more confidence in freshness compared to the random single bags I used to find online.",
        "source_5": "I tracked the coffee with chicory pricing across three weeks and the Amazon four‑pack fluctuated enough that I ended up paying more per pound than at an international market 20 minutes away. After taxes and a small shipping surcharge (no Prime on that order), the math worked out to roughly $9 per pound, while the brick‑and‑mortar store had it at $7.49 with a loyalty card. Two cans came with minor dents, and although the grounds tasted fine, I wouldn’t call the online bundle a money saver if you’ve got local options.",
        "source_6": "I brought a sleeve of the cookies to the office and they disappeared by lunch, but a coworker with dental work struggled with how rigid they are. When I packed snack boxes for my kids, I swapped these out for softer sandwich cookies because the crunch was a bit unforgiving. If you’re buying for older relatives or anyone who prefers a gentle bite, I’d pick something less firm."
