        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on breakfast here. I went up to the 6th floor at 9:30 and found the buffet picked over: the scrambled eggs were lukewarm, the bread basket had mostly heels left, and the fruit bowl was down to melon rinds. The coffee machine had a small queue, and staff began clearing trays around 9:50 even though it’s advertised until 10. The view is pleasant but mostly rooftops; the window seats were taken, and the remaining tables were crammed close together. For 17–18€ per person, I expected refills to come out faster.",
        "source_2": "Only talking about location: despite the Ku’damm address, it’s a 7–8 minute walk to Uhlandstraße U-Bahn and about 10–12 minutes to the S-Bahn at Savignyplatz. Buses (like the 109 and X10) are close, but reaching Museum Island or anything in the East took me 25–35 minutes with a transfer. After 9 p.m. the stretch around the hotel was pretty quiet, and most shops were a bit further toward the busier section of the boulevard. You won’t find trams here, which limits the quick hop-on options.",
        "source_3": "Overall take from a winter weekend: check-in was smooth, and the front desk spoke clear English and sold me a Berlin WelcomeCard on the spot. The room felt thoughtfully arranged with plenty of space to unpack, double glazing kept street noise out, and the marble bathroom had a deep tub that turned a cold February evening into a soak-and-read session. Breakfast on the 6th floor covered everything I wanted—cold cuts, muesli, eggs—and I liked lingering by the window with coffee while it snowed. With the U- and S-Bahn within easy reach, I crisscrossed the city without hassle and felt the rate I paid was fair for the area. I’d book the same place on my next Berlin trip.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on price: the room-only rate looked enticing at 79€ per night, but once I added breakfast (18€), Wi‑Fi for two days (10€), and the city tax, my total landed close to what properties 50–100 meters further along Ku’damm were charging for packages that included extras. Even the minibar water was 4€. It didn’t feel like the bargain the address suggests.",
        "source_5": "My overall experience over three nights: the first room I was given faced a courtyard and felt tight, with a narrow tub and a hairline crack in one corner of the marble surround. Housekeeping missed a dusty patch on the desk and the heater clicked loudly when cycling. Requests were handled, but slowly—an extra pillow took a little over an hour and a follow-up call. The hotel’s printed directions to the nearest U-Bahn weren’t clear, so my first trip out involved a detour. After this stay, I’d pick a different base next time."
