        "source_1": "I finished this MOOC last week to get up to speed on the current wave of digital change. The weekly path made sense to me: we started with data-network effects, moved to platform ecosystems with cases like Uber and Shopify, then wrapped with AI governance and regulation. The capstone had me map my company’s value chain and propose a pilot around an internal API. The checklist for opportunity sizing and the short “playbook” PDFs were easy to reuse with my team, and I appreciated how the instructor tied each idea to concrete examples rather than leaving it abstract.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on organization: Week 2’s quiz asked about “jobs-to-be-done” before the term was introduced (it only shows up in Week 3), and the assignment rubric referenced a “prototype canvas” that wasn’t linked anywhere in the Week 2 materials. A couple of readings in Week 1 pointed to outdated articles, and the sequence between “platform strategy” and “marketplaces” felt reversed—examples in the latter depended on definitions from the former.",
        "source_3": "Only about content depth: the “AI in practice” section relied on analogies (restaurant menus for recommender systems, traffic lights for reinforcement learning) without digging into even a simple metric like precision/recall. The blockchain lesson focused on headlines from 2018 and didn’t compare permissioned vs public chains. I kept looking for a worked example or a small dataset exercise to anchor the concepts, but it stayed at slide-level summaries.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the innovation toolkit: the course’s “user guide” materials were practical—I downloaded the idea scorecard, ran a two-hour ideation session at work, and used their stakeholder map template to prep for a director review. The prompts in the “project yourself” section nudged me to articulate a before/after state and measurable outcomes, and the sample pitch deck made it straightforward to translate notes into a five-slide proposal.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: I’d point newcomers here first. I’ve worked as a product manager for five years, and the first two modules were mostly a refresher, but the capstone forced me to quantify ROI and identify adoption risks in a way I hadn’t done in a while. Peer reviews were hit-or-miss—some detailed, some one-liners—and the discussion forum was quiet during my cohort. Even so, I walked away with a vocabulary my non-technical stakeholders understood and a plan I could present.",
        "source_6": "Only about captions/transcripts: the auto-captions repeatedly turned “edge computing” into “etch computing” and missed “API gateway” in three different lectures. Diagrams referenced in the transcript appeared as “[image]” with no alt text, and the downloadable SRT files didn’t include slide numbers. Playback speed options worked fine, but the mobile app crashed twice during 25+ minute videos when I switched networks."
