        "source_1": "I tested this by sprinkling it over a slice of whole‑wheat toast with raspberry jam. The jam rehydrated the powder just enough, and the bite tasted so much like my usual peanut butter and jelly that my partner couldn’t tell the swap. In smoothies, I blend one frozen banana, a cup of almond milk, a spoon of cocoa powder, and two tablespoons of this, and the peanut note reads clearly without the heavy feel I get from regular PB.",
        "source_2": "When I try to make a spread by mixing it with water, the consistency turns thin and a bit grainy. On toast it stays dry unless I really soak it, and in a chicken wrap it formed little clumps that wouldn’t smooth out with a fork. In my blender, it left a dusty layer around the top unless I let it run for a full minute, and compared to a fat‑based nut butter it doesn’t hold ingredients together—things keep falling out of the wrap.",
        "source_3": "I swapped this in for my weekday breakfasts to keep the meal under 350 calories: English muffin, fruit spread, and two spoonfuls of powder. Paired with jam, the peanut character comes through fine, but on plain toast it reads more “nutty dust” than a proper spread. I also used it in a Thai‑style marinade with lime, soy, and chili; it dissolved, but the sauce needed extra coconut milk to carry the mouthfeel that peanut butter usually provides. In cookies, it gave a light peanut aroma, though the texture baked up drier than my usual recipe even with added oil.",
        "source_4": "From the nutrition panel, a serving is low enough that I expected a longer stretch between meals, yet I found myself hungry again in about two hours, whereas regular peanut butter keeps me steady closer to four. To feel topped off, I ended up doubling the scoops or adding yogurt or banana to my smoothie, which nudged the total calories back up. The sodium listed is higher than my standard jar of natural PB, and the protein is there but not quite at the level I get with a peanut butter sandwich, so it didn’t anchor lunch the same way.",
        "source_5": "I keep a jar at the office because it’s easier to store than a tub of peanut butter—no oil separation, and it doesn’t leak—but the fine powder kicks up dust when I scoop, so I’ve started measuring inside a large mug to contain it. The lid seals well enough for commuting, and it stirs into oatmeal quickly, though I need extra liquid to avoid a chalky spot at the bottom. Price‑wise, my last purchase worked out to about twenty cents per tablespoon, which beats premium nut butters but not the budget store brand; for Thai wraps, lime and a touch of honey help it behave more like a sauce.",
        "source_6": "Flavor‑wise, it doesn’t read exactly like the jar I keep at home: the roast comes across lighter, with a faint sweetness and a mild aftertaste that reminds me of malt. On a tortilla with shredded carrots, cilantro, sriracha, and lime, the peanut note got lost and I ended up adding a teaspoon of regular PB to get the aroma I wanted. Smelling the jar, the peanut scent is subtle, and my kids noticed the switch right away when I tried it in their PB&J."
