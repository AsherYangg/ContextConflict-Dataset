        "source_1": "I’ve tracked the battery with AccuBattery for a month. With two SIMs active, about 2 hours of YouTube, an hour of Maps, and messages throughout the day, I get roughly 4–5 hours of screen-on time and need to plug in by early evening. Overnight standby drops 8–10%. On a weekend when I limited myself to calls and SMS only, it limped into the second evening at around 15%, nowhere near a multi‑day stretch without charging.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the interface: after the March OTA, animations feel tight and consistent. Swiping between home screens is fluid, the app switcher pops up immediately, and switching between Chrome, Gmail, and Photos doesn’t hitch. Subway Surfers and Alto’s Odyssey run steadily, and I can tab out and back in without reloads. Fingerprint unlock lands me on the home screen in under a second most times.",
        "source_3": "I picked this up for ₹6,799 as a spare. Two years in, it still boots reliably, handles WhatsApp calls with my parents, and sits in the glove box for weeks without attention. When I rotate it in, it manages basic tasks—texts, banking OTPs, Google Maps—without drama. The camera is simple and the speaker is on the quieter side, which is fine for a backup role.",
        "source_4": "This has been my only phone for 18 months. Two email accounts syncing, UPI payments at shops, and an hour of browsing on the train every day. Calls are clear and 4G holds steady on my commute. I do notice an occasional pause when loading a heavy app, but it hasn’t pushed me to carry a second device. No repairs so far, and the casing hasn’t loosened.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on battery: with light use (calls, SMS, a few photos, Bluetooth off), I average 2 to 2.5 days per charge. During a festival week when I used it almost exclusively for calls, I charged on Sunday night and didn’t need the cable again until Thursday evening—five days of standby with brief daily call sessions.",
        "source_6": "Interface-only impressions: even after a factory reset, the launcher hesitates—swiping up to view all apps takes a beat, and the dialer opens after a 3–4 second pause. Typing in Telegram, the keyboard occasionally drops characters unless I slow down. Temple Run is fine for the first few minutes and then starts to stutter, with frame drops whenever notifications arrive. I switched to a lightweight launcher just to keep home screen transitions from hitching."
