        "source_1": "I bought a single unit here and then checked my receipts: $3.82 at Kroger, and Walmart in my town has it for a few cents less. The Amazon listing showed $5.49 for the same UPC and size, and after tax it rang up to $5.96 at my door. Same brand, same ounces, just a bigger hit to the wallet for the convenience of delivery.",
        "source_2": "I keep this as a pantry staple and order it with my monthly household bundle. The seal was tight, flavor was exactly what I expect from this brand, and all three units arrived in a box with air pillows so nothing was dented. Subscribe & Save knocked the price down a bit for me (around $4.10 per unit last cycle), and it showed up the day before a dinner party, which saved me a late-night store run.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on packaging: my shipment came double-boxed with each item in its own sleeve, no leaks or tears, and the lot code matched across all units. Expiration dates were 10–11 months out, which works for long-term storage. Labels were clean and legible, and the ounces matched the product page.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on price, I got a better deal here by stacking a coupon with Subscribe & Save. I ordered the 6-pack, and after the 15% subscription discount and a clipped coupon, my per-unit cost dropped to $3.58. That’s actually under the $3.82 I saw at Kroger last week, and I didn’t have to spend gas or time driving across town.",
        "source_5": "I scanned the barcode on arrival and compared it to the one on the jar from Kroger—identical UPC, identical net weight. Amazon charged me $6.29 before tax for a single, while Kroger’s shelf tag was $3.82 and Walmart had it on rollback for $3.68. It feels like you’re paying a premium here for the same exact thing.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take: the product tastes the same as the store-bought version and fits the recipe I use each week, but the online price jumps around. One day it’s $4.99, a few days later it’s $6.19, and then it dips during a promo. Meanwhile, my local Kroger has been steady at $3.82 and Walmart hovers a bit under four dollars. The swings make it hard to plan a recurring order."
