        "source_1": "I finished this course while working a 9–6 job, and the weekly rhythm fit into my evenings without much reshuffling. The videos were bite‑sized, the quizzes mirrored what was shown, and the programming assignments were doable with the code shown on screen. I mostly stuck to the platform materials and didn’t feel the need to hunt for extra problem sets, which made the whole thing feel manageable over five weeks.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on workload: the practice exercises on the platform weren’t enough for me to retain the material. I had to build small R scripts on my own—like re‑implementing a simple cross‑validation loop and rewriting dplyr pipelines from scratch—just to make the concepts stick. Between pausing lectures to take notes and doing off‑platform drills, I was spending 12–15 hours a week, well beyond the listed estimate.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on faculty comprehensiveness: Jeff’s walkthroughs of topics like tidy data, reproducible reports with R Markdown, and the bias–variance idea were unusually step‑by‑step. He would show a messy dataset, reshape it with tidyr, explain why each verb was chosen, and then knit the result so you saw inputs and outputs side by side. That pacing made the syntax and the “why” behind it click for me.",
        "source_4": "Also on faculty comprehensiveness but from a different angle: I often felt lost when the lecture moved from a simple example to a more complex one without bridging steps. For instance, the switch from a basic linear model to regularized regression referenced terms like lambda selection and cross‑validation folds without defining them first. I ended up pausing every few minutes to search for definitions and read blog posts to fill in the gaps.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: the subject matter is exciting, but the course felt uneven week to week. One assignment asked for a full data cleaning pipeline with functions not yet introduced, while another barely went beyond copying code from the slides. Discussion forums helped occasionally, but peer feedback varied a lot, and I bowed out after the third week because I wasn’t building confidence despite hours of note‑taking.",
        "source_6": "Sticking to a single aspect—teaching style: Jeff’s delivery kept my attention during longer sessions. He used concrete case studies (e.g., turning a health survey into a tidy table, then plotting outcomes) and narrated his thought process while coding, including small mistakes and quick fixes. That transparency made it easier to follow along without rewatching segments."
