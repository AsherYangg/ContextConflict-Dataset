        "source_1": "I signed up during a busy semester and kept up because Dr. Ng’s energy made the lectures feel like coaching sessions rather than slides. The way he walked through gradient descent—starting with intuition, then showing the curve flattening as alpha changes—made me look forward to the next video. I started watching him at 1.25x every morning before work and could recall his whiteboard sketches when doing the Week 1 quiz.",
        "source_2": "I tried to take the course primarily on the Coursera app during my train commute, and the logistics kept tripping me up. Downloads stalled around 99%, playback lost my place between devices, and the Week 2 quiz wouldn’t submit in Chrome until I cleared cookies. The autograder for the cost function exercise rejected my solution because I used a different variable name than in the template, even though the math was correct. Dr. Ng’s explanations were clear enough, but I spent more time wrestling with the platform and grading scripts than practicing the concepts.",
        "source_3": "I focused on the section about vectorization and felt lost when the lecture jumped from the scalar cost to J = (1/2m) * (Xθ − y)ᵀ(Xθ − y). The indices vanished, shapes were implied rather than shown, and “m by n” dimensions were mentioned without a slow, line-by-line mapping. I kept pausing every few seconds to check if θ was a column or row and why the transpose appeared there. A fully worked small example with explicit i and j would have helped me connect the dots.",
        "source_4": "I treated the course like a two-week boot camp: two lectures at lunch, an exercise after dinner. By the end of Week 2, I had a notebook full of derivations and a tiny logistic regression classifier working on a churn sample from my job. The weekly rhythm—short videos, a quiz that mirrored the explanations, then a coding task—fit neatly into my schedule, and I never felt behind.",
        "source_5": "As a non-native English speaker, I relied on captions, and they made the math sections harder than they needed to be. “Lambda” showed up as “llama” in multiple spots, minus signs disappeared in a couple of equations, and the Spanish subtitles drifted by about 5–10 seconds in Week 3. I ended up switching to 0.75x speed and cross-referencing the PDF transcripts just to keep track of symbols.",
        "source_6": "Taking a step back, the lectures kept me interested, but the programming flow didn’t translate to my day-to-day tools. The exercises lean on Octave/MATLAB with a lot of TODO blocks, so I never had to set up data loading or evaluation from scratch. The optional project sat in peer review for four days, delaying my goal to finish before a work deadline. After completing the course, I could discuss bias–variance trade-offs confidently, but I still had to find separate material to build an end-to-end pipeline in Python."
