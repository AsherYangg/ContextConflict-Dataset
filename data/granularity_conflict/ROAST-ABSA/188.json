        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for photos. Over the weekend, I shot my niece’s indoor birthday party under warm lights, and the pictures kept skin tones natural without odd smearing. Night shots of the cake candles kept the background visible without blowing out the flames. I printed a couple 12x18s and the detail held up, especially on faces and hair. For travel, the quick shutter and reliable focus let me catch street shots without blur.",
        "source_2": "Battery life has been the sticking point for me as a heavy user. Typical day: 1.5 hours of gaming (CoD Mobile), 2–3 hours of YouTube on 5G, Slack/Teams all morning, and Google Maps for a 45‑minute commute. Starting at 7 a.m., I’m scrambling for a charger by mid‑afternoon; it dips to around 15% by 3–4 p.m. even with auto‑brightness. My screen‑on time averages about 5 hours, so I carry a power bank to get through the evening.",
        "source_3": "I picked it for the A15 Bionic and it delivers on speed. Apps pop open instantly, the camera launches without delay, and I can jump between email, a dozen browser tabs, and photo edits without reloads. Genshin Impact at 60 fps on medium settings stays steady for an hour, and exporting a 5‑minute 4K clip took under 8 minutes. It stays comfortable to hold unless I’m charging and gaming at the same time.",
        "source_4": "My experience with the A15 in games hasn’t matched the hype. PUBG Mobile runs fine at first, but after 20 minutes the frame rate dips and the phone warms near the top. If I start a 4K video recording, then switch to Maps and Messages, the keyboard hesitates and app switching stutters for a few seconds. It feels quick after a reboot, but sustained loads seem to throttle sooner than I expected.",
        "source_5": "I’m a light‑to‑medium user—mostly messaging, photos, Spotify, and podcasts. After two weeks, I finish most days with 35–45% left, around 6–7 hours of screen time on Wi‑Fi with brightness near 50%. The camera handles kids running around the house without motion blur, and the chip chews through casual games. For my routine, I plug it in overnight and never think about battery during the day.",
        "source_6": "Overall, the camera is great and the chip never feels weak, but the day‑to‑day has been rough for my workload. Between Outlook, constant hotspotting, an hour of gaming, and 5G navigation, the battery dips fast; by early evening I’m on low power every day. The phone also heats up during longer gaming sessions, which makes me dial down graphics. For heavier use, I’ve had to plan on a mid‑day top‑up just to make it home."
