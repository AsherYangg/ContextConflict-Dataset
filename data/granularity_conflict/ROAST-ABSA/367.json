        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in April and picked this place mainly for the convenience. I stepped off the train at Central Station, crossed the street, and was checking in within five minutes; the tram stop is right outside too. My room was compact but tidy, with crisp sheets and a bathroom that looked freshly scrubbed. Breakfast was part of my rate, and I never had to think about city tax at checkout—it was already rolled into the total I prepaid. The front desk handed me a bundle of city maps, and there was a little booklet in the room with a self-guided walk; I joined the walking tour they recommended and it helped me get my bearings around the old town. For what I paid—about 110€ a night—it felt like a fair deal.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing strictly on cleanliness because that’s what matters most to me. In my 4th-floor room, the headboard had a layer of dust, and there were two long hairs in the shower drain when I arrived. The glass shower door had water spots and a bit of soap film that hadn’t been wiped down. The carpet by the desk showed a faint coffee stain, and the trash can liner hadn’t been replaced. Housekeeping did come the next afternoon, but the drain area still didn’t look fully cleared. If you’re particular about spotless bathrooms, this might be an issue.",
        "source_3": "If you’re debating location, here’s my take after two nights facing the station. Getting around is effortless—you walk out and the trams and trains are right there, and it’s maybe 15 minutes on foot to the old city. The flip side is noise: tram bells, platform announcements, and late-night chatter carried up even with the window shut. The glazing seemed older, and I could still make out the station clock chime early in the morning. I managed with earplugs, but if you’re a light sleeper, ask for an interior room. Convenience is undeniable; uninterrupted sleep was harder.",
        "source_4": "I booked because the listing said breakfast and taxes were included, but my bill told a different story. At checkout, they added a city tax of 3.20€ per night that I hadn’t expected, and the breakfast room staff explained that the hot items (eggs and sausages) had a 7€ surcharge—only the continental spread counted as included. The front desk said this was policy, but it wasn’t spelled out on my confirmation email. I felt like I had to keep asking what was covered and what wasn’t, which isn’t how I want to start the day. The actual food I ate was fine; the confusion over what I was paying for wasn’t.",
        "source_5": "Service was uneven during my stay. The first person I met at the front desk processed my check-in quickly but barely looked up, and when I asked about early access to the room, I got a clipped “after 3 pm” with no offer to store my bag. Later that evening, a different staffer spent ten minutes circling a walking route on a map and showed me exactly which tram lines to take to the museum quarter; he even printed my boarding pass without me asking. Housekeeping missed a towel change one day, but the night shift sent fresh ones upstairs right away. Depending on who you talk to, you might get a warm welcome or just a transaction.",
        "source_6": "I only tried the breakfast, so this is purely about food quality. I went down around 7:15 and the scrambled eggs were already lukewarm, with the tray looking a bit dried around the edges; sausages were pale and didn’t have much snap. The breads and croissants were fresh and the jams were decent, but most of the fruit was from a can. Coffee came from a push-button machine that produced something thin unless you doubled the shot. It filled the gap before sightseeing, but if you’re expecting a memorable spread, you may want to look at one of the cafés near the station."
