        "source_1": "I’ve been using the iPhone as my main device for about three months, and as a whole package it’s been easy to live with. The screen is punchy outdoors, Face ID unlocks instantly, and the handoff with my Mac for calls and notes has been seamless. My routine is light social apps, email, and music on Bluetooth from 7 a.m. to around 10 p.m., brightness at about 50%, and I typically end the day with 20–30% left. I don’t shoot a lot after dark, and I haven’t noticed any warmth beyond the first day of app restores, so day-to-day it feels smooth and dependable.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on battery life: on my commute and workday (Spotify over AirPods, Slack, Gmail, Maps for 45 minutes, 5G on), the percentage drops fast—100% at 7:30 a.m. and I’m hovering around 15–25% by 2 p.m. even with Low Power Mode. I’ve trimmed background refresh and kept brightness under 40%, but it still requires a mid-day top-up. After eight weeks, Battery Health shows 96%, and I’ve started carrying a small power bank because the phone can’t make it through an afternoon of meetings and navigation.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on heat: the phone warms up quickly during video calls and navigation. A 20-minute Microsoft Teams call over LTE makes the top-left back area feel toasty through a thin case, and the frame gets uncomfortable in direct sun on the dashboard while using Maps. Games like Genshin Impact at medium settings stutter after 10–15 minutes, which I’m guessing is throttling. It cools down a minute or two after I close the app, but during use it’s warm enough that I take it out of the case.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about the camera at night: in dim restaurants and street scenes, night mode often picks a 2–3 second exposure, and any slight movement turns faces into smears. Neon signs bloom into fuzzy halos, and shadows look speckled when I zoom in. Portrait mode hunts for focus under warm indoor lights, and I’ve had several shots of my kid on a carousel come out soft even when I held the phone as steady as I could. Daylight photos are crisp, but low light is hit-or-miss unless I brace it on a table.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take after switching from Android, the interface is straightforward and the ecosystem perks (AirDrop, iMessage, Apple Pay) are convenient, but two issues keep biting me: by mid-afternoon the battery is nearly tapped on a normal office day (Slack, Outlook, 30–40 minutes of Maps, a few short videos), and the phone tends to warm up during Instagram Reels or longer camera sessions. A school play in a dim auditorium left me with soft, noisy photos, so I’ve started packing a charger and taking daytime shots when I care about the result."
