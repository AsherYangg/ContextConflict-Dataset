        "source_1": "I’ve been watching the Week 2 and 3 video lectures on optimization during my commute, and the structure makes them easy to follow: each clip opens with a one‑slide roadmap and ends with a short recap. When the instructor writes a formula, the MATLAB/Octave window shows the corresponding code immediately, and the cursor highlights each line as it runs. Font sizes are large enough to read on my phone, captions match the narration without lag, and the description has timestamps that jump straight to gradients, vectorization, or the demo. I paused to try the snippets and could always tell which step we were on.",
        "source_2": "I signed up mainly for the video lectures, but the presentation gets in the way for me. The audio level jumps between cuts, so I have to constantly adjust volume, and the mic pops during the derivative walkthroughs. Slides cram multiple equations onto a single frame, and the code pane is small enough that I can’t read it unless I fullscreen and squint. In Week 3, the instructor jumps from setting up a cost function to a fully vectorized MATLAB/Octave solution without showing the intermediate loop version, so the demo feels more like a reveal than a walkthrough.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, I’m halfway through and already have a working Octave script that normalizes a dataset and runs gradient descent with a simple learning‑rate schedule—something I hadn’t stitched together end‑to‑end before. The weekly quizzes line up with the examples shown in the clips, and the discussion forum is responsive; a mentor pointed out that I was mixing matrix and element‑wise multiplication, and their annotated screenshot cleared it up. The pacing lets me finish a module after work, and I’ve started using the Week 1 checklist to clean up data at my job.",
        "source_4": "Taking the course as a whole, I was hoping for more depth. The first four weeks revisit material I saw in an earlier intro class, and when topics get interesting—regularization and feature scaling—the derivations are skimmed with a promise to “revisit later” that never quite happens. Programming assignments feel constrained: a lot of skeleton code with blanks to fill, so I don’t get to design the workflow from scratch. I kept waiting for a capstone‑style project that ties multiple ideas together, but the syllabus moves to the next unit instead.",
        "source_5": "I use the course community a lot. I posted a question at 10 p.m. about broadcasting rules in Octave, and by morning two learners had shared annotated snippets and a community TA linked a short notebook that matched the week’s notation. Pinned threads collect common pitfalls per assignment (off‑by‑one indexing, shape mismatches), and the “ask a mentor” option led to a detailed comment on my loop that cut my runtime in half. That back‑and‑forth keeps me on pace when I get stuck.",
        "source_6": "Zooming in on coverage: the syllabus lists optimization, linear algebra refreshers, and model evaluation, but the evaluation unit is a single video with two toy examples and a short quiz. Optimization gets three weeks yet stays at a high level—no line‑search methods, and convergence is handled with a basic threshold check. The MATLAB/Octave portion is more granular, with lots of helper functions and live demos; outside of that, several topics are handled in one short clip followed by a quiz."
