        "source_1": "I booked through a blind deal and arrived not knowing what I’d get. Check-in took under five minutes, and the desk team offered to reconfirm my city tour times without me asking. My room on the sixth floor looked freshly turned over—crisp sheets, no scuffs on the desk, and a faint citrus smell. I made a habit of stopping by the lobby pour between 6–7 pm; the glass was generous and gave me time to mark up a paper map the staff had highlighted with bus routes and alternate walking paths. For a quick city break, everything fell into place.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on housekeeping. When I walked in, the bathroom mirror was spotted and there was a long hair on the vanity. The carpet by the window felt gritty under bare feet, and the desk chair had crumbs along the seams. I asked for a touch-up; someone came promptly with a spray bottle, but the wipe-down missed the trash under the sink and dust on the baseboards. Towels were fresh, yet the tub drained slowly and left a ring. If cleanliness matters most, give the room a careful once-over before unpacking.",
        "source_3": "About the lobby wine hour: it’s not as simple as “free every night.” The sign said 6–7 pm, but both days the bottles were gone by 6:30, and on the second night they asked for $7 for another pour after the first glass. Drinks came in plastic cups, with water as the only non-alcoholic option. A couple next to me was told the complimentary pour applied once per stay unless your rate included a perk code. If that’s a deciding factor, plan to show up right at six and don’t expect refills.",
        "source_4": "I chose it for location and it worked well. From the front door, it’s a five-minute walk to the tram and under ten to a strip of cafes and a pharmacy. There’s a small market across the street for snacks, and rideshares arrived in two minutes or less. I felt comfortable walking back after a show; the streets were well lit and busy. Morning runs were easy—straight to the waterfront without dodging heavy traffic. For first-time visitors, it’s an uncomplicated base with plenty within reach.",
        "source_5": "Here’s my overall take. The front desk folks were cheerful and printed my tour vouchers, but my room faced an alley with a humming exhaust fan that never shut off. Street noise carried late, and the blackout curtains didn’t fully block a neon sign across the way. Elevators crawled; twice I waited close to ten minutes. The room assigned through the opaque deal seemed to be in an older wing—scuffed doors, thin walls, and a tub that drained slowly. I cut my last morning short just to find some quiet outside.",
        "source_6": "I only interacted with the front desk and can’t speak to the rooms. I arrived at 2:45 pm and was told keys wouldn’t be ready until 4; luggage storage was a single rolling rack with no tags, which made me nervous. I asked if they could confirm my prebooked tour time—no concierge on duty, and the agent slid me a phone number instead. The line stretched to the door, so questions felt rushed. My first key didn’t work, and when they reissued it, my last name was misspelled in the system. A printed map wasn’t available—just a QR code."
