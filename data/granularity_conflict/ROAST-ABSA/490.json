        "source_1": "I took this as a refresher and ended up drafting a four-page argumentative piece by the final week. The short lectures stack neatly, and the example breakdowns made structure less intimidating. My peer reviews arrived within two days each time, with two classmates leaving line-by-line notes on my thesis and transitions. The rubric felt straightforward, so I always knew what to fix on the next draft.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the grading system: my Week 2 essay sat in the queue for nine days and I had to post in the forum to get enough reviews to release a score. The two comments I finally received were one-liners like “nice” and “great,” and both gave full marks without pointing to any sentence-level issues. I still wasn’t sure how to improve, and the resubmission window had already closed.",
        "source_3": "Looking just at the course content, the lessons on thesis focus and paragraph cohesion were the standout. I copied the sample outlines and used them to plan a 650-word reflection for work, and it flowed better than anything I’ve written in years. The instructor’s before-and-after examples of topic sentences made it clear how to cut filler, and the quick quizzes kept the key rules in my head.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, the lectures were clear and the pacing worked, but the assessment model kept tripping me up. Across three assignments, my scores swung from 72 to 94 with little explanation, and one peer docked points for using the Oxford comma. There wasn’t a way to escalate or ask an instructor to arbitrate, so I spent a weekend nudging classmates in the discussion board just to unlock my final grade and certificate.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on peer review alone, I actually had a smooth run: three reviews landed within 24 hours for my Week 3 draft. One reviewer flagged passive voice in two paragraphs and linked a style guide, another suggested trimming my introduction by 40 words. I applied their notes and my next submission jumped a full band on the rubric, especially on clarity and coherence.",
        "source_6": "Big picture, this course helped me move from staring at a blank page to producing a three-page essay with a clear outline by the last module. I would have appreciated at least one TA-led critique to calibrate expectations, since peers vary a lot in how they apply the rubric. With the class size, I understand why they rely on crowd feedback, but a single expert pass would have tied everything together."
