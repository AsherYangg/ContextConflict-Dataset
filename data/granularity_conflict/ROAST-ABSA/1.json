        "source_1": "I’m only here for taste and texture, and the recent cups haven’t hit the same mark. The broth turns thin unless I dump the entire seasoning in, and even then I reach for soy sauce to wake it up. The noodles rehydrate fine—springy enough after five minutes under a kettle—but the base lacks that savory backbone it used to have. The veggies plump up and look colorful, yet they don’t contribute much beyond crunch. If you’re chasing a rich sip straight from the cup, this version feels watered down.",
        "source_2": "The “lower sodium” splash on the front sent me straight to the Nutrition Facts, and the numbers tell a different story than I expected. The serving size is smaller than my older cups, and the container still lists two servings, which no one at my office actually splits. Net weight is down, the water line looks lower, and the sodium per serving drops mostly because the serving itself is lighter. It reads like less soup rather than a smarter recipe. I went in expecting the same portion with adjusted seasoning, not a cup that fills me less.",
        "source_3": "As an overall lunch option, these are still easy: boil water, fill to the line, lid on for five minutes, stir hard, and you’ve got something warm at your desk. The flavor is dependable once you learn your routine, but the packaging changes make me double-check the panel each time. I tried saving half for later once and the noodles went pasty by the next day, so “two servings” is more of a label statement than a real plan. The convenience is great for busy days, yet the front-of-pack claims don’t line up neatly with what I taste and how much I’m actually eating. I keep one in my drawer for emergencies, even if I’m side-eyeing the marketing a bit.",
        "source_4": "I prefer the large McDougall cups because one can carry me through an afternoon of meetings without snacks. Filled to the line, it’s closer to a bowl than a snack cup, and sometimes I can’t finish it in one sitting. On colder days I’ll add a handful of frozen peas and it still feels like a full meal. If you want something substantial from a cup, this size delivers.",
        "source_5": "For anyone sensitive to salt, using about three-quarters of the seasoning packet has been the sweet spot. I stir in the dry mix gradually, taste, and stop right before it tips into that heavy-salty zone; a squeeze of lemon and some scallions round it out. The noodles keep a nice chew and the broth stays flavorful without that salty aftertaste. This tweak has made the cup a regular part of my weekday rotation."
