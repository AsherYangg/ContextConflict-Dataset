        "source_1": "I spent a long weekend here with my partner and came away impressed with how smoothly the stay went. Check-in took five minutes and the front desk answered a couple of questions about subway routes without fuss. The location made it easy to hop between neighborhoods; we walked to a couple of museums and grabbed late-night snacks from a deli on the corner. Our room on the 12th floor had enough space for two suitcases to lie open and a wardrobe with proper hangers, plus a desk where I could get some emails done. We plan to book the same place next time we’re in the city.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing solely on room size: in my queen room, the bed was close to the wall and there was maybe a foot of clearance between the bed and the desk chair. My carry-on could slide under the desk, but my larger suitcase wouldn’t open fully unless I blocked the bathroom door. The closet was shallow, so bulky coats ended up draped over the chair. It worked for one person, but two people trying to get ready at the same time felt like a game of Tetris.",
        "source_3": "Just talking about service: I arrived a little after midnight and had to wait while two associates finished a conversation before acknowledging me. The first set of key cards didn’t work, so I went back downstairs to have them reprogrammed. I requested extra towels in the morning and they showed up nearly an hour later, after a second call. The doorman wasn’t consistently at the door, which made getting a rideshare with luggage awkward.",
        "source_4": "Only commenting on the location: the nearest subway entrance was a few blocks away and required stairs, which was rough with a stroller. Crossing the busy intersection outside with kids felt stressful, and rideshare pickups tended to circle because there isn’t much curb space. Nighttime brought sirens and delivery trucks, so light sleepers might notice it. Getting to Midtown for meetings meant a transfer, and by the time we reached the office, we’d already spent a chunk of the morning in transit.",
        "source_5": "Over three nights, the room felt tidy and the bed didn’t leave me tossing around. The shower had steady water pressure and the vanity was well-lit for getting ready. On the flip side, the AC unit rattled at odd intervals and the elevator to higher floors took longer than I expected during peak times. Street noise filtered in on the second night, though an extra blanket from housekeeping made the room cozier. With decent cafés nearby and easy airport transit by train, it fit a short business trip.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on the room itself: my king room had blackout curtains that actually blocked the morning sun, a firm mattress with clean linen, and a shower with a rainfall head that didn’t splash all over the floor. The mini-fridge kept leftovers cold, and there were enough outlets near the desk and nightstand to charge a laptop and two phones. The thermostat responded quickly when I nudged it a couple of degrees, and the in-room coffee setup helped me get out the door early."
