        "source_1": "I bought this strictly for the convenience of leaving a big bag by the closet and refilling a bistro feeder, but the ordering window takes planning. Twice the 40‑lb shipment showed up a few days later than the carrier estimate, and by day two of scraping the bottom of the bin I had to grab a small bag of grocery kibble to bridge. My building doesn’t allow packages in the lobby overnight, so signing for a 40‑lb box means arranging my lunch break around the delivery window, and the box barely fits on the elevator cart. I now set a calendar alert three weeks before I expect to run out and keep a 5‑lb “emergency” bag, because no local store carries it and running out means an immediate diet change my cats definitely notice.",
        "source_2": "I track pet costs pretty closely, so here’s the math from my kitchen scale: my two cats eat roughly 6 oz each per day, which makes a 40‑lb bag (640 oz) last about 53 days. At $90 delivered, that’s about $1.70 per day for both cats, roughly $0.85 per day per cat, which comes out near $6 per week per cat. The bag has a fair amount of kibble fines toward the end, and I end up tossing the powdery stuff instead of packing the feeder with it, so the real lifespan for us is closer to 50 days. I used to buy Iams at the supermarket for $18 per 7‑lb bag and go through two bags a month; this switches the spending to fewer, heavier shipments with a slightly higher weekly outlay and a lot more pantry space dedicated to pet food.",
        "source_3": "I changed over gradually—75/25 for a week, then 50/50—and watched the litter box closely. By the second week the stools were firmer, but the odor seemed sharper and hung in the bathroom longer, even with clumping litter and a covered box. My older cat had more gas in the evenings after free‑feeding, and I could hear her belly gurgling when she sprawled on the couch; it settled down after I cut off access overnight. Hairballs didn’t increase, but cleaning frequency did, because if I left the box for a day the smell was noticeable even with the exhaust fan on.",
        "source_4": "I’ve kept my two mixed‑breed indoor cats on this for about three years and built a routine around it: a bistro feeder on the kitchen mat, an airtight bin next to it, and a calendar reminder to reorder when the bin hits the halfway mark. Their coats look slick without a separate oil supplement, the older one isn’t gassy the way she used to be, and neither has thickened up even with food always available. The litter box is easier to live with—less room‑clearing after they go—and I scoop once in the morning and once at night without dreading it. A 40‑lb bag lands at my door about every twelve weeks, and by my estimate it works out to roughly $4 a week per cat, so I just treat the auto‑ship charge as part of the monthly budget.",
        "source_5": "My focus is weight, because my tortie is an indoor nap‑champ. With the bistro feeder she started taking small snacks all day and crept up 1.5 pounds over a couple of months, which the vet flagged at her checkup. I switched to measured meals—one third cup morning and one third cup evening—and the grazing stopped, but it took a full bag cycle to nudge the scale back down. Free‑feeding is convenient, yet for my two, the scheduled portions made the difference between idle nibbling and actually finishing a set meal.",
        "source_6": "I tried this as a full replacement, but both cats needed coaxing. The younger one pecked at it only if I mixed a splash of warm water or a spoon of canned food, and the older one inhaled it and then threw up if I didn’t space out smaller servings. The first shipment took nine days to arrive, and the bag had a lot of kibble dust that clogged our gravity feeder, so I ended up sifting it with a colander before refilling. I didn’t see much change in their coats during the month we used it, and their litter routine stayed about the same—two scoops a day, same clumping performance. Price‑wise, it lands close to what I pay for Blue at the pet store, but it pushes more storage and delivery planning onto me."
