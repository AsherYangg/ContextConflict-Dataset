        "source_1": "I picked South Pacific Hotel mainly for the Wanchai location. In the mornings I walked to Times Square in about 7–8 minutes; the tram stop by the corner got me to Central without transfers. There’s a bakery two doors down where I grabbed egg tarts and coffee, and a supermarket a block away for snacks. On the flip side, hauling a suitcase across Hennessy Road was awkward, and late at night taxis bunch up by the crosswalk so the curb gets crowded. From the airport I took the A11 to Tonnochy Road and walked five minutes without getting lost.",
        "source_2": "I tried both a double and a twin on different nights. The double on 12/F felt tight: once the suitcase was open, you had to sidestep to reach the window. The twin on 18/F had more floor space between beds, and we pushed them together without scraping the nightstand. Both rooms had a wedge-shaped layout because of the building, which made the desk usable in the twin but cramped in the double. If you care about elbow room, the twin layout made moving around easier.",
        "source_3": "Housekeeping was hit and miss during my four-night stay. The sink and mirror were wiped daily and the towels were fresh, but I noticed dust along the headboard and a coffee ring on the desk that stayed there until I wiped it myself. The grout on the shower floor had a few dark patches near the drain. The trash was emptied, yet crumbs under the chair by the window lingered a second day. Not a dealbreaker, just not the level of detail I was hoping for.",
        "source_4": "My room came with a small bar fridge and a kettle. The fridge held a couple of drinks but ran lukewarm until I called to have it adjusted; after that, cans were cool but not icy. The kettle boiled quickly, though the first fill had a plasticky smell—running two cycles cleared it. They supplied tea bags but no coffee, so I bought instant from the 7‑Eleven downstairs. Having both appliances was handy for late-night tea and keeping yogurt cold.",
        "source_5": "I stayed six nights while visiting friends and the overall experience was easy. Check-in took five minutes, and the concierge helped load up an Octopus card and circled a dim sum spot on a paper map that turned out to be excellent. The doorman flagged taxis even when it was raining, and housekeeping kept fresh water in the room. The bed was firm in a comfortable way, shower pressure was steady, and I liked being able to walk to Causeway Bay shops after dinner. The rate fit what I was aiming to spend, and I’d book it again for the convenience.",
        "source_6": "I was in town for a convention and the nightly rate spiked compared with what I’d seen a few weeks earlier. For what I paid, the double room felt worn: scuffed skirting boards, a chair with a loose arm, and a view straight into another block. Twice the front desk asked me to wait while they finished long calls before answering a simple question about the Airport Express shuttle, and my suitcase didn’t reach the room for about 25 minutes after check-in. The lobby felt clogged at peak times and the lift queues were slow, so I’ll look at other options next time."
