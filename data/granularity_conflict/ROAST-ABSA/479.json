        "source_1": "We stayed five nights in early June and the place made a strong first impression. Check‑in took about five minutes and they handed us cold towels and hibiscus tea. Our room (241) had a balcony over the lagoon with two chairs and a handy drying rack. Housekeeping came around 10 a.m. each day, swapped linens, and even left towel swans for our kid. Breakfast had an omelet station, ripe mango and pineapple, and a cappuccino machine that didn’t taste like instant. Dinner rotated themes—seafood grill one night, a curry spread another—and the pool bar mixed proper lime mojitos. We never struggled to find loungers after 9 a.m., and walking paths lined with bougainvillea made getting around feel like a little stroll through a garden.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on one thing: room cleanliness. In B‑316, the tile floor felt gritty under bare feet as if it hadn’t been mopped between guests. There were two long hairs stuck to the shower wall and water spots on the glass. The bedside lamp was dusty enough to leave a fingerprint when I wiped it. We called at 3 p.m. for fresh towels and didn’t get them until after 7. The bathroom bin wasn’t emptied on our second day either.",
        "source_3": "My focus is the food quality. The breakfast buffet looked extensive, but the hot trays were often lukewarm—scrambled eggs watery, pancakes pale in the middle, coffee that tasted like it had sat on a warmer too long. At dinner the pasta station was the safest bet; the carved meats ran dry and the sauces leaned salty. Fruit was abundant but several pieces were underripe. By the third night we walked to the plaza across the road for tacos.",
        "source_4": "What stood out for me was the staff. Daniela at the front desk arranged a last‑minute airport transfer and printed our boarding passes without fuss. The lifeguard noticed our toddler struggling and brought over extra floaties. In the restaurant, servers learned our names by the second morning and had oat milk ready for my wife without prompting. When a storm rolled in, a bellman stood at the lobby doors handing out umbrellas.",
        "source_5": "If you care most about service, my experience didn’t match the hype. The front desk agent kept her eyes on the screen and pushed a form at me without explaining the deposit hold. The towel hut scolded me for asking for a second beach towel, saying they were “low” even though stacks were visible. At the lobby bar, the bartender skipped our turn twice while chatting with regulars. I requested an extra blanket at 10 p.m.; after two follow‑ups, it arrived a little after midnight.",
        "source_6": "For an overall take, the grounds are postcard‑pretty, but rest was hard to come by. Our room faced the main stage, and music plus mic checks carried clearly until around 11:30 each night. Hallway chatter came through the door, and the A/C unit cycled with a rattle that woke me. The room itself was spacious with strong shower pressure, yet the nightly noise and the scramble for sunbeds by 7 a.m. took the ease out of the trip. We ended up spending afternoons off‑site at a quieter public beach."
