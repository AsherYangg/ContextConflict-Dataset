        "source_1": "I was in town for a conference at the Moscone Center and picked this place for the location. From the lobby it took me about seven minutes on foot to reach the south entrance, even with morning crowds. In the evening I walked to Union Square for dinner and shopping without needing a ride, and there’s a cable car stop two blocks up the hill for getting to the Wharf. A Walgreens on the corner handled forgotten toiletries, and catching a rideshare on Market Street was straightforward.",
        "source_2": "I booked a corner junior suite and the two walls of glass were the star. Floor-to-ceiling panes wrapped the bedroom and even continued into the bath, so sunrise lit the entire space. The double walk-in shower ran the length of the far wall, and the stone floor drained well so there was no puddling. Blackout shades were motorized and tight, though the sheer layer let me keep the skyline in view without feeling exposed.",
        "source_3": "My three-night stay covered a Tuesday through Friday. Check-in crawled—two agents, a line of eight, and key cards that had to be reprogrammed twice before the elevator would accept them. The room itself had space to spare and a big TV, but the HVAC fan cycled loudly at night and street noise from Mission Street bled in until after midnight. Housekeeping skipped replenishing bath towels on the second day and I had to call down; the operator promised a runner “right away,” which ended up being 45 minutes. The spa desk was cheerful when I booked a massage, yet the overall rhythm of the stay felt stop-start rather than seamless.",
        "source_4": "I only interacted with the spa team on level two, since I was visiting friends and didn’t need much from the front desk. They squeezed me into a late slot after a conference session ran long, offered a quick locker setup, and walked me through the eucalyptus steam and showers without rushing. The therapist checked pressure preferences clearly and sent me off with tea and a cold towel. On the way out the attendant recognized me the next day and asked how my shoulders felt, which made it easy to book another treatment.",
        "source_5": "First visit to San Francisco and I went for a junior suite because I planned to work in the room each afternoon. Corner windows brought in tons of daylight, the desk faced the skyline, and the Wi-Fi handled video calls without stutter. I used the iPod dock as a speaker with a 30-pin adapter I travel with, streamed a movie to the large TV in the evening, and the double shower turned into a post-run ritual. Front desk printed my slides without charge and the bell team stored a box of samples between meetings. I slept through each night and walked to the convention sessions in the morning with coffee from the lobby cart.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on in-room tech: the television is oversized and crisp, with HDMI easy to access for a laptop presentation run-through. The channel guide is clear and there’s a dedicated port hub by the desk. The music option, though, is an old iPod dock that doesn’t fit a modern phone without an adapter; no Bluetooth speaker in the room, so I ended up using my phone’s speaker while getting ready. Plenty of outlets by the bed and USB-A ports, but no USB-C."
