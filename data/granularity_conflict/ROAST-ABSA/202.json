        "source_1": "I came to the forum with a simple, non-graded question: is it reasonable to use two break statements inside a while loop to handle different exit conditions in week 3. A mentor jumped in and gave a long monologue about what counts as “real code” versus pseudocode, without addressing the control-flow part. The thread got steered into definitions and style debates, and my original question was never answered. A couple of students tried to help, but the mentor kept redirecting and eventually locked the topic for being “off track.” I ended up testing in my notebook and confirming the behavior myself, but the exchange left me second-guessing whether it was okay to ask exploratory questions.",
        "source_2": "As an overall experience, this course clicked for me. Dr. Chuck explains loops, dictionaries, and file handling with short stories, and the exercises build up from counting words in a file to parsing JSON from web services in a way that feels like real progress. I finished a little ahead of my target date because the pacing made it easy to do one video and one assignment per lunch break. The autograder nudged me toward small corrections without derailing momentum, and the sample code in the lectures translated directly into what I needed for the quizzes. By the time I reached the email log parsing exercise, I could read the problem, sketch the approach, and implement it without getting stuck.",
        "source_3": "I want to focus on faculty response only. When I posted a snippet about breaking out of a while loop after a sentinel value, a mentor replied within an hour with two runnable variations: one using multiple breaks and one using a boolean flag. They pointed me to the official Python docs on break/continue and walked through why my indentation caused the loop to miss the second condition. No scolding about pseudocode—just a clear path from my sketch to valid code. They checked back the next day to see if the change fixed the failing test in the autograder.",
        "source_4": "Judging the course as a whole, I had a tougher time than expected. The regular expressions lecture didn’t quite cover the specific patterns used in the quiz, so I relied on outside tutorials to pass. Peer reviews varied a lot—one reviewer flagged “missing comments,” another said the same file was “over-commented,” which made it hard to know what standard to follow. The forum felt busy and sometimes more focused on rules than on clarifying the lesson, so I mostly stuck to tinkering locally. I finished the modules, but I never felt fully synced with the way the quizzes probed details that the videos only touched on briefly.",
        "source_5": "Keeping it to a single aspect—mentor engagement—I had a productive exchange around control flow. I asked whether it’s better practice to restructure a nested while with early exits or to keep a single break and use a guard variable. The mentor drew a small flowchart, refactored my code to a function with early returns, and then showed an equivalent version with a loop flag, explaining trade-offs in readability and testability. They also merged my duplicate thread and linked two past discussions so I could see alternative patterns. That thread became a bookmark I returned to during the capstone when I had to untangle a loop that parsed lines from a mailbox file."
