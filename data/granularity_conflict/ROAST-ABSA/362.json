        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly to practice problem solving. The weekly sets felt punishing more than instructive: on Problem Set 3, Q4 about timelike geodesics near Schwarzschild, the boundary conditions weren’t stated, and the peer rubric expected a numeric perihelion shift with a particular approximation that wasn’t discussed in lecture. I spent two late nights deriving Christoffel symbols only to learn the grader wanted a shortcut hinted at in a buried forum thread. Even after getting 100% on the autograder, the peer comments contradicted each other about index placement. It left me guessing what level of rigor the course wanted.",
        "source_2": "I went through four weeks before stepping back. I have Calc III and a semester of differential geometry, but the lectures jumped from quick index notation refreshers to Riemann curvature with very few concrete physical examples. The pacing felt uneven—long chalkboard derivations, then a sudden leap to Einstein equations with little time on stress–energy modeling. Quizzes emphasized symbol pushing over interpretation, and when I reached the cosmology week, I realized I was spending my evenings cross-referencing Carroll to fill gaps instead of following the course flow.",
        "source_3": "The instructor’s style worked well for me. He builds each derivation line by line—e.g., the FRW Christoffel symbols were obtained from the metric without hand-waving, and the geodesic deviation lecture included a careful discussion of Jacobi fields that I hadn’t seen in other online materials. His answers in the discussion forum were detailed, and the bonus video on boundary terms in the action cleared up several confusions I had from reading Wald.",
        "source_4": "My bottleneck was the platform. Several videos wouldn’t buffer beyond 720p, and at 1.25x the audio desynced with the handwriting. The captions garbled notation (Γ^i_jk shows up as random words), which made it hard to search. Twice the assignment uploader froze at 99% and marked my submission late even though the PDF timestamp was within the window. On mobile, inline equations sat off-screen so I had to guess what symbol was being referenced.",
        "source_5": "I completed the course start to finish and then reopened chapters I’d abandoned in Wald and Hartle with much better traction. The week on weak-field limits tied the math to perihelion precession and light bending in a way that finally clicked for me, and the capstone derivation of the Newtonian limit gave me a template for working through other approximations. The combination of lecture notes and my writeups has become my go-to reference while I self-study more advanced texts.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on the assignments: they demanded real work but paid off. Problem Set 4 had me compute lensing deflection in the weak-field metric and compare it with a numerical integration; PS2 required writing out the nonzero Christoffel symbols for a diagonal metric and checking them with a quick SymPy script. The hints nudged without giving away the path, and the autograder’s tolerances forced me to be precise about sign conventions and index placement."
