        "source_1": "I took the full five-week run and treated it like an evening class after work. The flow made sense to me: Week 1 on ARPANET and NSFNET, then protocols like TCP/IP and DNS, and a later section on security with certificates and hashing. The quizzes leaned on scenarios rather than trivia, which nudged me to connect the timeline to how the network actually behaves. I’m a marketing analyst with no CS degree, and by the end I could sketch the path a packet takes and why browsers complain about expired certs.",
        "source_2": "I only care about the security section, and that part felt skimpy. The lecture touched on passwords, hashing, and the lock icon in the browser, but there was no demo of a TLS handshake, no certificate chain inspection, and no look at real traffic. The assignment asked us to peek at HTTP headers, yet the steps were vague and there was nothing on tools beyond a passing mention of the browser console. I finished that week still unsure how man-in-the-middle attacks are detected in practice.",
        "source_3": "I enrolled as a theater major curious about “jumping into programming,” and the first technical assignment knocked me sideways. We were asked to install Python and write a small script to fetch URLs, but loops and error handling weren’t covered at the point the task appeared, and command-line basics were assumed. I spent two evenings googling how to set PATH on Windows and deciphering tracebacks before I could submit. The forum helped, yet the lectures didn’t bridge that gap for someone who’s literally never coded.",
        "source_4": "Taking the course end to end, I felt the title promises more depth than it delivers on the “technology” part. History is narrated clearly, but when protocols come up the explanations lean on metaphors and skip mechanics—BGP gets a cameo, DNS caching is waved at, and routing decisions remain foggy. I often watched at 1.5x because the delivery is long-form, slide-heavy monologue, and the auto-generated captions were out of sync in several spots. I finished all quizzes and still couldn’t confidently explain certificate revocation or why traceroute hops sometimes disappear.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the instructor’s explanations: the way Dr. Chuck walks through the TCP three‑way handshake with a mailbox analogy finally clicked for me. He draws out sequence numbers, shows why retransmissions happen, and ties it back to packet switching versus circuits without drowning you in algebra. The DNS lecture where he contrasts root servers, TLDs, and authoritative records step by step felt like a guided tour; I paused three times to jot diagrams and it all held together when I rewatched."
