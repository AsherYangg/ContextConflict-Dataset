        "source_1": "I arrived at the Pelham around 11:30 pm after a delayed flight. The lobby had eight people waiting and two front-desk agents juggling calls. My prepaid reservation (through a conference portal) wasn’t showing up in their system, and I was asked to sit while they “looked into it.” After about 40 minutes and three trips back to the desk, I was given a temporary key with a note to return in the morning to finalize. The next afternoon, Lakiesha Wilson tracked down the booking and fixed the rate, but that first night felt like there wasn’t much urgency or communication from the team.",
        "source_2": "I booked a king room and was assigned 514. The space was tight—once I rolled in my medium suitcase, there wasn’t room to open it on the floor. The window looked onto a brick wall, and the AC unit cycled on with a metallic rattle every few minutes. The bathroom had nice tile, but the grout lines were dark near the base, and the showerhead sprayed unevenly. Housekeeping replaced the toiletries but forgot fresh hand towels one day, so I used the bathmat as a stand-in.",
        "source_3": "I chose the Pelham because it’s supposed to be near the action. In reality, it was a 12–15 minute walk to Bourbon Street in July heat, and the stretch back late at night felt pretty empty. Rideshare pickups were awkward with the one-way streets, and there were sirens and party noise echoing until well past midnight. For the convention center, I still needed a car, and getting one during peak hours added a long wait.",
        "source_4": "Weekend stay with my partner: check-in just after 3 pm was smooth, valet took the car, and the front desk handed us a paper map with their highlighted favorites. Lakiesha helped secure a last-minute table at a small bistro a few blocks away. Our room had high ceilings, a comfortable bed, and a spotless shower; we kept the blinds open for natural light during the morning. From the door, we walked to the French Quarter for beignets, and the streetcar stop was close enough to reach the Garden District without fuss. I’d book the same place for our next New Orleans visit.",
        "source_5": "I was in town for meetings and needed a reliable workspace. My room didn’t have a proper desk, just a small round table that wobbled, and the Wi‑Fi dropped twice during a Zoom call. Mornings started with a line at the valet stand, so I built in extra time to get to appointments. The hallway outside my floor felt humid, and the elevator stopped at nearly every level during rush hours. When I checked out, the front desk was backed up and it took about 20 minutes to settle the bill and retrieve luggage from storage."
