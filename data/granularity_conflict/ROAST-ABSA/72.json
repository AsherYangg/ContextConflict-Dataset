        "source_1": "I bought the Redmi K50i mainly for long days on the road, and the battery is the only thing I really play close attention to. With two SIMs active, 4G on all day, and brightness around 60%, I regularly hit about 6 hours of screen-on time by 10 p.m. That’s with an hour of YouTube on the train, lots of WhatsApp, and some GPS in the afternoon. Overnight standby drops 1–2%. I plug it in while brushing my teeth in the morning and it gains enough to get me through the day again, so I don’t carry a power bank anymore.",
        "source_2": "After two weeks as my main phone, I moved my SIM back to my old OnePlus 7. On the K50i, the screen would go white during calls and ignore taps for a few seconds, so ending a call or switching to the keypad was a hassle. The side fingerprint reader missed often enough that I defaulted to PIN. Animations felt uneven—scrolling Instagram or switching between Chrome and the camera would hitch, and typing in Gboard sometimes lagged. MIUI kept nudging me with “recommendations,” and there was a pile of preloaded apps to remove. The Dimensity 8100 looks great on paper, but side by side with the 855 in my OP7, opening heavy apps and resuming games didn’t feel snappier. For 27k, I expected a smoother daily driver.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on the fingerprint reader: I enrolled my thumb twice, tried different angles, and cleaned the sensor, but it still fails more than it should. If my hands are even slightly sweaty after a run, it rejects me repeatedly; with dry hands it improves, but I still see 2–3 retries before it unlocks. I ended up using face unlock in bright places and a PIN everywhere else, which defeats the purpose of buying a phone with a fast side scanner.",
        "source_4": "My usage is mostly Gmail, Slack, Chrome with 10–12 tabs, Telegram, and an hour of Maps, and the K50i holds up fine for that. With the display at 120 Hz, swiping between apps feels smooth, and I only notice dips when jumping in and out of the camera quickly. I play BGMI at 60 fps for half an hour in the evenings; it keeps the frame rate steady and warms up but doesn’t throttle noticeably. I installed a different launcher and disabled a bunch of system “recommendations,” and since then the interface hasn’t gotten in my way.",
        "source_5": "MIUI 13 on the K50i took work to tame. On first boot I got prompts for “personalized recommendations,” the Theme Store started pushing notifications, and GetApps kept highlighting downloads. I spent 30 minutes digging through Settings > Passwords & security > Privacy and Settings > Apps to toggle off recommendations, turned off “Glance” on the lock screen, and disabled/uninstalled a dozen preloaded apps. Even after that, I still get a banner in the File Manager now and then after updates. It’s manageable, but only after a lot of switches and restarts.",
        "source_6": "As someone who records calls and voice notes for work, the audio setup felt middling. The speakers are loud but get tinny above 80% volume, and the mic picks up wind noise easily on the street—colleagues said I sounded hollow unless I cupped the bottom. The camera is fine outdoors, but indoors it smooths faces and smears hair detail; HDR sometimes blows out windows. The touchscreen occasionally misses quick edge swipes when I’m typing fast, and during calls I’ve had the display flash to white, which makes it awkward to bring up the keypad without pulling the phone from my ear."
