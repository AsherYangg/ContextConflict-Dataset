        "source_1": "I stayed solo in a standard double and the floor space was basically the width of the bed plus a narrow strip. To open my carry-on, I had to put it on the bed. The desk was more of a ledge, and the shower cubicle was tight enough that I kept bumping an elbow. There was a kettle, a safe, and a hair dryer, but the layout left almost no breathing room.",
        "source_2": "I zeroed in on the free hot breakfast buffet. I got a voucher at check-in and went down around 7:30 both mornings. Scrambled eggs, mushrooms, bacon, baked beans, little pancakes, fruit, yogurt, and cereals—trays were refreshed quickly and the coffee machine did cappuccinos that weren’t watery. It ran until 10, and I didn’t need to buy anything else before lunch.",
        "source_3": "I’m reviewing only the staff: at check-in, the front desk circled the easiest walking route to Centraal Station on a paper map, told me which tram to take for the museums, and pointed out a nearby ticket machine. When I asked about a day trip, they checked train times and wrote the platform number. They kept that same helpful attitude every time I came back in the evening.",
        "source_4": "I used the on-site pub most nights because the prices beat the neighborhood. A pint of lager was around €4.50 and a gin and tonic was €6, noticeably less than bars a few blocks deeper into De Wallen. One night I grabbed a burger-and-beer combo for about €12, and I liked that I could charge it to my room instead of fishing for cash.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: the location made sightseeing easy—about an 8-minute walk to the main station and just outside the Red Light District, so I could reach attractions on foot. My room was compact but spotless and had the basics (kettle, toiletries, a small safe). The hot buffet each morning set me up for the day, and the bar downstairs kept evening costs in check. The front desk handled questions without fuss. I’d book the same place again.",
        "source_6": "Overall take: the convenience is undeniable—close to the train station and a short stroll to major sights—and the included hot breakfast saved me money. But the room size dominated my stay; with two of us, one person had to stand by the door while the other navigated around the bed, and our suitcases lived on the mattress because the floor space wasn’t there. The amenities were all present, yet it felt more like a ship cabin than a hotel room, so I’d choose somewhere with bigger rooms next time."
