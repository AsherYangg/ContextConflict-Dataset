        "source_1": "I took this as a refresher after only dabbling in Python, and the pacing worked for me. The weeks build from basic syntax into working with requests and simple pattern matching, with short videos followed by notebook exercises. After the API lesson I stitched together a small script to pull weather data from Open-Meteo and parse the JSON, then used a regex to tidy up some station names. The graded tasks matched what was shown in the walkthroughs, so I never felt lost when switching from the lecture examples to the exercises. I ended up pointing two teammates who are new to Python to the same sequence.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on structure: the sequence felt jumpy. Week 2 introduced list comprehensions before loops were properly covered, and error handling showed up after we were already making API calls. The course flipped between IDLE, terminal, and Jupyter without a clear reason, and a reading on files/directories appeared after a practice that already used those concepts. Lecture titles didn’t always match the notebook sections, so I kept bouncing back to find where a concept was first explained.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the technical topics: the API and regex material translated directly to my job. I used the requests examples with headers and pagination to pull issues from our GitHub org, then applied a compiled regex to group bug tags from commit messages. The instructor’s demo of checking status codes and using response.json() became the template for a newsroom script I wrote the next day. The patterns were current enough that I didn’t have to rework much to fit our stack.",
        "source_4": "Only about the graded assignments: they were narrow in scope and skipped edge cases. Several notebooks were fill‑in‑the‑blank with exact string matches, and I could pass one task by hard‑coding the expected output instead of writing a general solution. In the API exercise, there was no requirement to handle timeouts or 429 rate limits, so the code that worked in the sandbox wasn’t robust when I tried a different endpoint. The instructions were very stepwise, which left little room to explore alternative approaches.",
        "source_5": "On the optional challenges specifically: the “stretch” prompts at the end of the notebooks were no joke. The log‑parsing challenge had me combine argparse, pathlib, and a compiled regex to extract fields and write a CSV, and it took me two evenings to get it right. The hint to write a couple of unit tests forced me to think about malformed lines and encoding issues. Those extras didn’t affect the grade, but they were the most instructive part of the week.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after finishing the sequence over a long weekend: the core videos and quizzes go by quickly, and I was hoping for deeper problem sets. The optional sections in my run were mostly “try it yourself” blurbs without autograder checks, and one bonus task amounted to tweaking a single character in a regex. I wanted a path that pushed beyond the guided steps—maybe a capstone pulling from multiple weeks or a tougher set for those who finish early. I’d use this to get a newcomer started, but I kept looking elsewhere for heavier practice."
