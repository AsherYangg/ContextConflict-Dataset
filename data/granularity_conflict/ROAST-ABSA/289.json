        "source_1": "I ordered the 30‑lb bag on Amazon and expected the usual free delivery, but this listing carried a “heavy item” surcharge and added $7.99 at checkout. The box took five business days to arrive and weighed in at 32 lbs on my porch scale. Chewy quoted $4.95 shipping for the same size, and my local feed store offers free curbside pickup. For this specific item, Amazon didn’t waive the fee the way it does on a lot of my other orders.",
        "source_2": "I price-watched the 30‑lb bag for two weeks. On Amazon it hovered between $62.99 and $66.49; my farm supply store had it at $58.99, and Petco showed $60 with same‑day pickup. Even after 5% Subscribe & Save plus a clipped $3 coupon, the per‑pound cost on Amazon still beat me by a dollar or two compared to my local option. I bought it in-store because the math worked out better.",
        "source_3": "My Bernese inhales this kibble. A level 3‑cup portion is gone in under a minute, so I switched to a slow‑feed bowl to cut down the gulping. During the transition I mixed it half‑and‑half with his old brand and he picked these pieces out first. No broth or toppers needed; he literally sits next to the bag at feeding time.",
        "source_4": "After a month on this formula, his coat has a deep sheen and shedding is easier to brush out. Stools are firm and predictable—twice a day, no straining or gas. I did a simple 7‑day ramp (25/50/75%), and he handled the change without any messes. The kibble size is big enough that he actually chews instead of swallowing.",
        "source_5": "I’ve been getting the 30‑lb bag from Amazon every six weeks. With Prime, it lands on my porch in two days and I don’t get hit with extra fees. My Bernese finishes every bowl, his coat looks glossy, and his digestion has been steady since the switch. I checked a couple of sites with lower sticker prices, but once their shipping gets added, my total on Amazon ends up lower.",
        "source_6": "Gave this a fair shot and by day ten my 110‑lb Berner had soft stools and a dull patch along his back, so I moved him back to the previous brand. He also started leaving half a serving behind, which he never does. The Amazon listing in my ZIP wasn’t Prime‑eligible, so I padded the cart to hit the free‑shipping threshold and it still took nearly a week to reach me."
