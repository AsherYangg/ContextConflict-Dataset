        "source_1": "I took the course after years of shooting RAW and letting files pile up unedited, and it finally gave me a full workflow I could repeat. The instructor walks through non-destructive editing with adjustment layers, masks, and smart objects, then shows practical tools like content-aware fill for removing telephone wires and the healing brush for blemishes. The second week’s project had me retouch an event photo: evened skin with a gentle dodge and burn pass, cleaned the background with a clone stamp on a separate layer, and exported for both web (sRGB, 2048px) and print (300 dpi) with different sharpening settings. I paced it at 30–45 minutes a day and wrapped up in three weeks; the peer reviews came in on time and the before/after comparisons made it obvious where I was overdoing things.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the color grading section. It jumps from “apply a LUT” to “tweak curves” without showing how to read the histogram for midtone shifts, and there’s almost nothing about keeping skin tones natural when pushing blues into the shadows. The lesson videos never share RAW practice files for this module, so I had to test on my own shoot, which made it hard to match the instructor’s steps. The assignment asked for a “cinematic look” but didn’t give a reference frame or a target palette, so I wasn’t sure if my teal/orange balance was in the ballpark.",
        "source_3": "As a non-native English speaker, I relied on captions, and that part tripped me up. Several terms were mis-transcribed (for example, “dodge and burn” shown as “dog and burn”), and the Portuguese subtitles looked machine-generated, which muddled tool names. On top of that, the instructor uses a Mac, so shortcut callouts like Cmd+I didn’t always translate cleanly to my Windows setup; I had to pause constantly to figure out the Ctrl/Alt equivalents. The transcript PDF also lists steps without the onscreen overlays, so when he says “tap Q for quick mask,” there’s no screenshot to anchor it.",
        "source_4": "Taking the whole course into account, it leans heavily toward basics and the Adobe ecosystem. A big chunk is spent on Lightroom library setup and import presets, then we revisit exposure and white balance in a way that felt like a camera fundamentals recap rather than post-production depth. The frequency separation demo is a quick pass without discussing when to abandon it to avoid plastic skin, and there’s no deeper dive into advanced selections or blending strategies for composite work. The discussion board was quiet when I posted questions, and the instructor Q&A hadn’t been updated in weeks. If you’re not on Adobe, some segments are tough to map over because the UI examples stick to Photoshop 2020-era panels and don’t touch newer selection tools.",
        "source_5": "I want to highlight just the peer-graded assignments, because that’s where I got the most out of it. The rubrics are specific—white balance consistency, edge cleanliness on masks, and restraint on local contrast—and I received three reviews within 24 hours. One reviewer pointed out a halo around my subject where I feathered too little, another flagged that my skin smoothing killed pores, and a third shared a tip to use a low-flow brush for dodging eyes. I redid the submission with those notes and could immediately see the difference in the before/after stack. The portrait and landscape RAWs provided for those assignments were handy for testing without risking client files.",
        "source_6": "I don’t use Adobe; my setup is Affinity Photo plus Darktable, and I followed along fine once I mapped tools. When he demonstrates “Blend If” to keep skies from bleeding into buildings during a replacement, I used Affinity’s “Blend Ranges” and got a similar mask. The gradient map technique for toning also carried over directly, and the grayscale check for color contrast worked as expected. I downloaded the practice assets and paused at each step to translate the shortcuts. It took longer than the video runtimes, but the methods themselves weren’t locked to one brand."
