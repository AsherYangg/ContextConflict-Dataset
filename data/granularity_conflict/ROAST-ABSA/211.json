        "source_1": "I booked the hotel for its canalside address, but the nights were louder than I expected. Our room faced the street, and the pubs on the corner kept a steady hum of conversation and clinking glasses until well past midnight. Around 6 a.m., delivery trucks and early cyclists added a new soundtrack, plus the occasional tram bell from Westermarkt. Even on the top floor with the windows shut, I needed earplugs. Lovely neighborhood to walk during the day, yet not the quiet retreat I’d hoped for when trying to sleep.",
        "source_2": "From the moment we rolled our bags into the courtyard, everything felt smooth and easy. Check-in took minutes, and we were given a canal-view room with big windows, herringbone floors, and a comfy bed with crisp linens. The bathroom had strong water pressure and a rainfall showerhead, and there was enough closet space for both of us. Breakfast was like a little market: made-to-order omelets, fruit that actually tasted ripe, and a tray of fresh stroopwafels that disappeared quickly. The team at the desk found us a last-minute canal cruise and booked a cozy table at a bistro around the corner. We walked to the Anne Frank House in under five minutes and spent the evenings exploring Jordaan. I’d choose this place again without thinking twice.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing only on the room. I booked a “classic” category for three nights and found the layout awkward: beams cut into the ceiling near the bed, so I kept catching my shoulder when standing up. With two carry-ons open, there wasn’t enough floor space to walk around; we ended up stacking one bag under the desk. The armchair had a threadbare arm, and the desk lamp flickered unless I wiggled the switch just so. The AC fan rattled on low, and housekeeping missed a line of dust behind the curtains. The shower was great, but I never felt like the room matched the photos for proportions.",
        "source_4": "Just commenting on breakfast. Both mornings around 9:00, there was a queue stretching into the lobby, and once seated, coffee took nearly 15 minutes to arrive. The buffet looked abundant at first glance, but several trays were close to empty, and replacement was slow—scrambled eggs were lukewarm, and a couple pastries had gone dry at the edges. Staff were kind but clearly stretched thin. At 34 euros per person, we bailed on day three and grabbed cappuccinos and warm croissants from a bakery two doors down.",
        "source_5": "The property itself is gorgeous, but service was inconsistent during our stay. Our taxi dropped us at the curb in the rain, and the porter watched while we hauled two heavy suitcases to the entrance. We arrived just after noon and were told the room would be ready by 2 p.m.; at 2:45 there was still no update until we asked again. I asked the concierge to secure timed entry for the Van Gogh Museum; the email confirmation showed the wrong date, and we had to rebook for the next day. Turn-down didn’t happen on the second night, and when I called down, the phone rang without pickup for several minutes. The setting and interiors are photogenic, but the follow-through on small requests missed the mark."
