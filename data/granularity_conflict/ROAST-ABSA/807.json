        "source_1": "I only cared about the internet since I had late-night deadlines. I booked a “Business King” and asked at check-in whether Wi‑Fi was included; the front desk told me to use the “T‑Mobile Wi‑Fi” tile and that my cellular plan would cover it. In room 1214, I connected two devices without any paywall—no ethernet cable, just the hotel SSID. Speed tests hovered around 35 Mbps down, 12 up, and the captive portal never asked for a card. I combed through my folio at checkout and there were no access fees, just taxes and one room service charge.",
        "source_2": "Over three nights between Christmas and New Year’s, the stay was a mixed bag. The website gave me the impression online access was part of the rate, but each morning the ethernet login page insisted on a $9.95 authorization and took about five minutes to process before granting a session. Valet quoted $31 per day with in‑and‑out privileges; no confusion there, but it added up fast. Cafe 15 was quiet when I dropped in around 8:30 p.m., yet my salad and pasta didn’t land until roughly 35 minutes after ordering, and the server apologized for the kitchen “being behind.” On the plus side, the building sits an easy walk from the theater district and BART, which made getting to meetings simple.",
        "source_3": "I booked strictly for location and didn’t use any amenities. From the lobby it’s a 12–14 minute walk to Moscone, and the Powell Street cable car stop is about half a block away. I grabbed a coffee at 7:15 a.m. and was on a train by 7:25 thanks to the close BART entrance. Late at night the block thinned out, but I never felt stuck—rideshare wait times were under three minutes. If you’re planning to hop between Union Square shops and the conference center on foot, this address saves time.",
        "source_4": "I focused on the restaurant because I had a tight morning schedule. Sat at Cafe 15 at 9:05 a.m., water and menus arrived immediately, coffee was poured by 9:07, and my spinach omelet hit the table at 9:17. The server checked back twice without hovering, and the bill was clipped and ready when I asked at 9:25. It wasn’t packed—maybe half the tables occupied—but the pace felt organized rather than drawn out.",
        "source_5": "Parking was my biggest logistical question. The valet desk quoted $31 per day and confirmed that covered unlimited exits, which matched the signage. On the second night, a “holiday rate” placard appeared showing $25 for guests on certain packages; my companion’s room had the discount, mine didn’t. I ended up using the public garage one block over at $18 with no in‑and‑out, and compared receipts at checkout: the hotel posted exactly two days of valet for her at $25/day and none for me."
