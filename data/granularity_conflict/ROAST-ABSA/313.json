        "source_1": "I bought a bag for my toddler and he took one bite and pushed the rest away. The discs had a stale, styrofoam-like crunch and a faint bitter aftertaste. I tried one myself and it felt dry, sticking to the roof of my mouth. Even with banana slices on top, my kids left the pieces on the plate. Maybe our batch sat too long, but the texture didn’t resemble the airy puffs we get from other snacks.",
        "source_2": "I keep a pack in the glove compartment and another in the diaper bag because they’re perfect for errands. The bag seals tightly and the cakes don’t shatter from being jostled next to wipes and sippy cups. On a two-hour drive, I handed them out one by one and the back seat stayed surprisingly clean. They’re flat enough to slide into snack containers without hogging space. It’s an easy handoff to car seats without sticky fingers afterward.",
        "source_3": "I picked these specifically for the ingredients. The front shows organic certification, and the panel lists just rice with a pinch of salt—no syrups, colors, or “natural flavors.” That matters in our house since we try to avoid extras. My 8‑month‑old handled them fine during supervised snack time with no redness or tummy upset afterward. I feel better offering something this simple.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday snack, these work well for both my three-year-old and my two-year-old. They munch on them between meals, and for lunch I use a slice of cheddar and a bit of turkey to turn one into a quick rice cake sandwich. The discs are easy for small hands and there’s no crust debate at the table. I toss a sleeve in my tote because they hold up during errands and park time. On longer drives, they buy us a few quiet minutes.",
        "source_5": "After a week of trial runs, these just aren’t a match for our routine. The cakes crumble all over the stroller and car seat, and the bits cling to clothing and upholstery. My toddler keeps asking for water after a few bites, so snack time gets messy fast. The stack looks generous, but they don’t keep anyone full and I end up offering yogurt or fruit right after. For the cost, we didn’t get much mileage.",
        "source_6": "The bag says 7+ months, which is why I grabbed it for my 7½‑month‑old, but the firmness caught me off guard. Even broken into quarters, they didn’t dissolve as quickly as the puffs he’s used to, and he gagged once, so I set them aside for later. My three-year-old nephew crunches through them without hesitation. The age guidance feels optimistic for early eaters."
