        "source_1": "I care only about strength and body. On my K-Select I pull an 8 oz cup with the “Strong” button, and this pod still feels dense enough to hold up to a big splash of half-and-half. I even tried a 10 oz pour and it didn’t wash out the way most K-Cups do—there’s a little sheen on top and a lingering cocoa note. If your main goal is a cup that doesn’t taste hollow, this one finally does the job.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on brew strength: even on the “Strong” setting at 6 oz, the cup comes out thin for me. Compared to my French press with the same roast level, the mouthfeel just isn’t there, and the flavor fades after the first few sips. I tested three pods from different sleeves to rule out a dud, descaled the machine, and got the same watery result each time.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday option, this has taken over my mornings. I set the Keurig to preheat while I feed the dog, hit “Strong,” and by the time I add a splash of oat milk I’ve got a cup that wakes me up without needing a second pod. I used to rotate Jet Fuel and Black Tiger, but after two 72-count boxes of this, I haven’t felt the urge to switch. The cups seat cleanly, no splatter, and the flavor stays steady across boxes.",
        "source_4": "Judging the overall experience, I’ve had a mixed run. One box tasted robust and smooth; the next had pods that sputtered and gave me a gritty cup with visible fines at the bottom. Two pods even bulged and leaked in the holder, which meant a messy rinse cycle and a vinegar clean to get rid of the lingering smell. After juggling that, the convenience advantage kind of disappears.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on aroma and finish: the kitchen smells like dark toast when it brews, which I like, but the sip leaves a sharp, metallic edge that sticks around. With a teaspoon of sugar and a small pour of cream, that note calms down, but straight black it’s a bit harsh for me. Funny enough, poured over ice it tightens up and tastes cleaner, so I’ve been using it mostly for iced cups."
