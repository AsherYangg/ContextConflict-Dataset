        "source_1": "I’ve been using the phone for three weeks and as an everyday device it’s been smooth: apps open quickly, the 120 Hz screen makes scrolling feel snappy, and calls over VoLTE have been clear. The camera has been fine for my routine shots—my kid’s birthday videos in the park look crisp and stable—but portraits indoors under warm LED bulbs do show some softness around faces. The sticker price felt high at first, but with a bank offer and an exchange I brought it down to ₹58k, which made the purchase workable for me. The box only included the cable; no case or charger, so I used my old USB‑C PD adapter and grabbed a generic case from the mall. Battery has been around 6.5–7 hours of screen‑on time, mostly on Wi‑Fi, so I’m not hunting for a charger before dinner.",
        "source_2": "I bought this phone mainly for portraits, and my tests in a dim apartment weren’t encouraging. Standing about 1.5 meters from the subject under two 12 W warm LEDs, portrait shots looked smeared—skin texture turned into a flat patch, and stray hairs around the forehead blended together like a watercolor. I turned off the beauty filters, tapped to focus, and tried both 1x and 2x portrait; the edge cutout was okay, but the face detail still collapsed, and the files looked soft even at full resolution. Switching to the stock “night” toggle helped exposure but didn’t bring back actual detail. Outdoors at 5 p.m. the same mode was fine, so the issue shows up clearly in room light.",
        "source_3": "On price alone, I feel the package is hard to justify. I paid ₹62,999 at launch and the box came with no charger or case, which meant another ₹2,000 for a 30 W adapter and ₹799 for a basic TPU cover the same day. For context, my spouse’s Brand Y model at ₹49,999 includes a fast charger and a case, plus a 3x telephoto that holds detail better beyond 2x zoom. The feature set here—single main lens, digital zoom, and no included accessories—doesn’t line up with the premium tag once you add the extra spend. If I were buying purely on value, I’d weigh those add‑ons and pick differently.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on accessories: the unboxing was barebones. Inside the sleeve there’s the phone, a USB‑C cable, SIM tool, and papers—no wall charger, no earphones, no protective case. I ended up hunting for a compatible PD adapter because my older QC charger wouldn’t trigger fast charging; the store didn’t have an official brick in stock, so I bought a third‑party one and a glass screen protector to be safe. The extra runaround and added cost weren’t part of my plan when I clicked “buy.” If you’re moving from an older device, check your existing charger before you assume it will work.",
        "source_5": "I’m the kind of user who cares only about battery, and this phone has been solid for that. With two SIMs active, auto brightness on, and the screen locked at 120 Hz, I get through 8 a.m. to midnight with around 15–20% left; my screen‑on time sits between 6.5 and 7.5 hours. Typical day is Slack, Gmail, an hour of YouTube, Maps for a 30‑minute drive, and Spotify on Bluetooth in the gym. I charge from 20% to 80% in about 35–40 minutes with my old USB‑C PD charger; not record‑breaking, but consistent. I don’t shoot many photos, so the trade‑offs elsewhere don’t bother me.",
        "source_6": "As an overall package, this felt like a jump from my mid‑range device: the display stays readable in noon sun, the stereo speakers are loud enough for podcasts in the kitchen, and the haptics make typing feel precise. The camera is perfectly fine for my use—portraits at a cafe window came out clean, and the edge detection around shoulders was neat; indoor evening shots softened a bit, but a recent update improved color and kept faces from turning orange. I got a student discount and an exchange bonus, so the final bill didn’t sting. The box lacking a charger wasn’t an issue because I already own a 65 W PD brick from my laptop, and I prefer picking my own case anyway. For daily life—messaging, photos for social, and light gaming—it’s checked the right boxes."
