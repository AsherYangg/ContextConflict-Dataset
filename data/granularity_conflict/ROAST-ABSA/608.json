        "source_1": "I bought this mainly because it felt light in the store, and after a few weeks that still stands out. I keep it in a running armband, and it doesn’t tug or bounce the way my old 210 g phone did. Reading in bed for 45 minutes, my wrist doesn’t get sore, and one‑handed scrolling on the train is easier because it doesn’t tip forward. Even with a slim case, it slips into a shirt pocket without pulling the fabric down, which is rare for phones this size.",
        "source_2": "I’m on the 6 GB/128 GB variant, and day‑to‑day performance has been uneven for me. Switching between WhatsApp, Maps, and Spotify, the keyboard sometimes takes a beat to appear, and opening the camera from the lock screen occasionally freezes for a second. BGMI at 60 fps drops into the mid‑40s after a few minutes, and the top around the camera bump gets warm enough that I notice it. I’ve turned off battery saver, disabled adaptive animations, and cleared cache, and the September update didn’t change much. The most annoying bit is when music gets killed in the background after I jump into Gmail and then back—feels like the memory management is too aggressive.",
        "source_3": "The split pull‑down for notifications and quick settings is something I didn’t know I needed until I used it. Swiping from the left shows just my alerts, and pulling from the right gives me the toggles, so I’m not hunting for the brightness slider or torch in a mixed panel. I rearranged the tiles—hotspot, data, and flashlight in the first row—and can reach them one‑handed on a crowded bus. Long‑pressing a toggle jumps me into the exact setting, and the haptic tap lets me know it registered even when I’m not looking. It’s been consistent enough that I’ve stopped using third‑party gesture apps.",
        "source_4": "After a month, the device is easy to carry and the screen stays readable in noon sun, but I find myself babysitting the battery. With camera use, Slack, and an hour of YouTube, I get around 3–4 hours of screen‑on before hunting for a charger, and there’s a 10–12% drop overnight even with Wi‑Fi off. The mono speaker sounds hollow on calls in a noisy cafe, and the stock launcher keeps nudging me toward theme packs I never asked for. I’m usually topping up by late afternoon, which changes how I plan my commute and meetings.",
        "source_5": "I set it up for work travel last week and it’s been smooth in the areas I care about. Calls are clear, and bouncing between Gmail, Sheets, Drive, and a couple of banking apps feels immediate. Asphalt plays fine for 20 minutes without frame hiccups, and the chassis never gets uncomfortably warm. The right‑side swipe for quick settings took a day to become muscle memory, and now I adjust brightness or toggle data while walking without digging through menus. It’s slim and light enough that I forget it’s in my front jeans pocket even with a case; the only quirk is in landscape, where a left swipe sometimes pulls notifications over a video, but a tap clears it.",
        "source_6": "I struggled with the left/right pull‑down behavior for notifications and quick settings. In portrait, I keep triggering the quick toggles when I’m aiming for notifications, and I’ve toggled mobile data off by accident more than once while trying to dismiss an alert. The brightness slider feels too close to the top row tiles, so my thumb lands in the wrong place when I’m doing it one‑handed. My dad borrowed the phone and couldn’t figure out why swiping from the right showed a different panel; it’s not obvious unless you’re told. I tried turning off “swipe down for notifications” in the launcher, but the system split shade still remains, and I wish there were a single, unified pull‑down."
