        "source_1": "I bought the phone two months ago and it’s been a handful. In the first week alone, it restarted mid-call three times—once while speaking with my doctor and twice during work check-ins. I updated to build 1.0.12 and later the September patch, but the random reboots kept popping up, especially right after I hit the dial button. The 5000 mAh battery also feels depleted by early evening; a 3-hour stretch of Google Maps and camera use took me from 82% down to 38%. On top of that, the touchscreen has moments where swipes don’t register, and I’ll get ghost taps near the top edge when scrolling through Instagram.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on battery life: the 5000 mAh pack has been a workhorse for me. I average 6–7 hours of screen-on time with 4G, Spotify, Telegram, and some YouTube during commutes. Brightness locked at around 60% and the display at 90 Hz. I end most days with 30–35% left and see only a 1–2% overnight drop with Wi‑Fi on. On a quieter weekend—mostly Kindle, some photos, and Bluetooth earbuds—it stretched to nearly two full days. I don’t game, and I keep auto-sync on, so it’s not like I’m micromanaging settings to squeeze longevity.",
        "source_3": "I had worries about stability after reading forum threads, but my unit has been rock solid since the August security patch (build A.08). I use dual SIM, VoLTE on both lines, and hold 40–60 minute conference calls on Teams almost daily. No abrupt restarts in three weeks; system uptime shows 19 days without a reboot. I toggled “always on mobile data” and disabled a third-party call recorder, which seemed to help with call reliability. Even after installing a dozen apps—banking, rideshare, two email clients—the UI stays responsive, and dialing is instant with no hiccups transitioning to active calls.",
        "source_4": "My gripe is the touchscreen. I type fast, and this screen regularly drops letters or doubles them, so “meeting” becomes “meeeting.” Drawing diagonal lines in a notes app shows jitter, especially near the top-right corner. I swapped the factory screen protector for a tempered glass one, then tried going bare glass—same behavior. It’s worst when my hands are slightly damp, and pinch-to-zoom in photos sometimes jumps as if there’s a phantom second touch. Gaming is out of the question; even simple swipe gestures in Subway Surfers misfire every few seconds.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the phone has handled my routine without drama. Calls on VoLTE are crisp, and I’ve yet to see a dropped connection during 30–45 minute discussions. The interface feels fluid, whether I’m switching between five or six apps or capturing burst photos. Battery-wise, I leave the office with plenty to spare, typically charging every other night. I installed all available updates right away and haven’t encountered any surprise restarts. The only hiccup was a brief camera shutter delay one afternoon; it resolved after a quick app restart. For regular day-to-day tasks, it’s been dependable.",
        "source_6": "I’m zeroing in on call behavior because that’s where things fall apart for me. Twice, the phone restarted as the call connected to customer support, and once it rebooted mid-sentence during a job interview—terrible timing. I updated to the latest firmware, cleared cache, disabled Wi‑Fi calling, and even swapped SIM cards. The pattern persists: tap the dial button, the screen freezes for a beat, then the device goes black and reboots. It doesn’t happen every time, which makes it harder to catch, but the unpredictability leaves me wary of making important calls without a backup device nearby."
