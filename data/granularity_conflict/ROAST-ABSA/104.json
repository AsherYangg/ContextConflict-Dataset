        "source_1": "I’m focusing just on battery life. With two SIMs active, 5G on auto, and the screen locked at 120 Hz, I average about 7.5 hours of screen-on time over a 16–18 hour day (emails, Slack, Google Maps, and an hour of YouTube). A 33 W charger takes me from 12% to 100% in roughly 1 hour 15 minutes; 10 minutes on the plug gets me ~18%. Overnight idle drain is ~3% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. After 14 months, AccuBattery estimates capacity at 86%; a commute using GPS and streaming Spotify over Bluetooth chews through about 20% in 90 minutes.",
        "source_2": "I bought this mainly for the camera and I’m sticking to that one aspect. Indoors at my kid’s basketball games, the focusing hesitates and I end up with motion blur at 1/50s, ISO jumping past 1600. Daylight street photos keep plenty of detail, but HDR sometimes halos around tree branches and clips bright skies. Portrait mode struggles with flyaway hair, cutting ears now and then, and the front camera’s skin smoothing can’t be fully disabled. Video at 4K30 shows micro‑jitter when I walk; 1080p with stabilization looks steadier but softer.",
        "source_3": "As an overall package, it’s been a straightforward daily driver. I restored from my previous phone in about 20 minutes, all my banking and transit apps re‑authenticated without drama, and I get regular updates roughly once a month. After six months of commuting, work calls, travel check‑ins, and boarding passes, it hasn’t forced changes to my routine. I tossed it in a backpack without a case, picked up a few scuffs on the frame, and kept going. For what I paid, it covers the bases I rely on every day.",
        "source_4": "Only talking about the display here. In “Natural” mode, colors track fairly neutral on my SpyderX (average Delta E around 2.1), but at low brightness I notice PWM flicker (240 Hz) that gives me eye strain during late‑night reading; enabling DC dimming helps, though the camera preview flickers in that mode. Outdoors at noon, auto‑brightness pushes high enough for maps, but on a beach day I still had to shade the screen. A 10% gray test image shows a faint pink tint in the lower left, and Netflix HDR raises blacks so shadow scenes look a bit washed.",
        "source_5": "Judging the device as a whole after a month: it handled onboarding, cloud restores, and my usual travel kit (eSIM for data, offline maps, and language apps) without getting in the way, but I’ve had two spontaneous reboots during navigation and a couple of delayed message notifications that made me miss a pickup. The service center reflashed the software; the hiccups returned a week later. It’s usable for calls, payments, and email, yet I keep a backup phone in my bag because I don’t fully trust it on days with tight schedules."
