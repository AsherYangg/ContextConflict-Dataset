        "source_1": "I joined for the instructor and ended up attending every live session. In week 3 he broke down contour drawing with a camera pointed at his sketchbook, narrating each line choice and why he left certain areas as negative space. He paused often to take questions from the chat and would redraw a shape when someone asked about proportions. He shared references to Klee and Kandinsky and posted links to free brush packs for those using Procreate. When I asked about stylizing shadows, he replied in the forum within the afternoon with a short video clip and a couple of practice prompts.",
        "source_2": "My experience with the instructor’s delivery was different from what others describe. Lectures regularly ran over the scheduled hour, and the last half often turned into slide reading with minimal interaction. Two of the live Q&A sessions were canceled on the day with only a brief announcement, which threw off my study plan. Forum replies tended to go to the threads with dozens of upvotes, while questions from smaller groups sat for days. The lapel mic crackled throughout weeks 2 and 4, so I watched parts with captions just to follow along.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the course as a whole, the structure made it easy to build from sketching to mixed media. The first module had short daily drills (10–15 minutes) that stacked into a weekend collage assignment, and by week 4 the project combined charcoal textures with watercolor washes. The community space was active; I joined a peer circle that posted progress shots every Wednesday, which kept me accountable. The final project felt disconnected from the earlier exercises because it introduced digital layering without a warm-up, so I had to pause and learn masking on my own. I finished the certificate after six weeks and now keep a small travel sketch kit in my bag for commuter practice.",
        "source_4": "I took the course on the mobile app during my commute and ran into platform quirks more than once. Videos defaulted to 480p and would drop to 360p mid-lesson even on a stable connection, which blurred fine line work demonstrations. Auto-generated captions mismatched terms like “gouache” and “wash,” and the transcript search missed several key phrases. Twice, my progress bar reset to the start of a module after an app update, and I had to re-skim lectures to trigger completion. The deadline extension policy was tucked behind a link three pages deep, so I learned about it only after a missed quiz.",
        "source_5": "Assignments and grading became the sticking point for me. The rubric listed “use of texture” and “composition balance,” but scores arrived two weeks late with one-line peer comments like “nice colors,” which didn’t map to the criteria. I submitted the week 4 mixed-media piece with detailed process notes and got a 70 without any pointer to what needed adjustment. Office hours covered technique, yet grading questions were deferred to a general FAQ that didn’t mention edge cases. By the end, I stopped uploading progress shots and focused on the exercises, since the evaluation didn’t seem to influence the feedback I received."
