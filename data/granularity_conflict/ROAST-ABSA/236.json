        "source_1": "I’ve been using this phone for two weeks as my daily driver, and it’s been a reliable all-rounder. On a weekend trip I filmed several 4K clips at my kid’s soccer game and the footage looked crisp when I scrubbed through on my laptop. Night photos from a dim restaurant kept the mood without turning everything into mush, while daylight shots had punchy skies and consistent detail on brick walls. I recorded a voice memo in a crowded cafe and my voice still came through clear. Battery typically gets me through a full workday with around 6–7 hours of screen-on time, and the included charger takes me from roughly 15% to 80% in about half an hour before slowing down near the top.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on video capture: I shoot short skate clips, mostly 4K/60. The autofocus keeps pulsing when the subject skates toward the camera, creating a distracting breathing effect. Panning across the park shows wobbly vertical lines (jello) and rolling shutter is noticeable on quick moves. In low light under the parking-lot lamps, noise crawls across flat surfaces and fine textures get smeared. The bitrate seems limited—fast motion produces visible macroblocking on rails and asphalt.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about sound recording: I record lectures and the built‑in mics have a hiss that’s easy to hear with headphones. Voices sound a bit thin and the stereo image feels narrow, making it harder to locate the speaker in a room. At a small gig, the audio clipped as soon as the drummer hit, and the limiter reacted late, leaving crunchy peaks in the first seconds of each song. Outdoors, even light wind overwhelms the recording unless I cup my hand over the top, and that introduces handling noise.",
        "source_4": "Battery life and charging only: With two email accounts syncing, 5G on, and the screen at 120 Hz, I end up around 18–25% by late afternoon with roughly 4–4.5 hours of screen-on time. Overnight idle drain sits around 7–8%. Using the included charger, I measured about 1 hour 40 minutes from 10% to 100%, with the power draw dropping sharply after 70%. The phone gets noticeably warm near 80%, and fast speeds only kick in with the bundled cable; with a third‑party USB‑C cable it sits much slower.",
        "source_5": "Photo camera specifics (day and night): Daylight HDR can blow out bright skies while faces go a shade too orange, and edges show halos from sharpening on tree leaves and window frames. Indoors at a museum, fine text on placards loses crispness even before zooming. Night mode takes 2–3 seconds and moving subjects smear into ghost trails; handheld shots of city lights look clean in the center but smear toward the corners. Street lamps also cause flares that streak across the frame.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after a month on the road: As a travel blogger I rely on one device for maps, photos, quick video, and voice notes. Switching between the camera, socials, and navigation feels a bit sluggish, and I’ve missed a couple of candid shots waiting for the camera app to be ready. By 5 p.m. I’m hunting for an outlet unless I’m extremely conservative with brightness and 5G. The included charger is bulky in a small sling bag, and I ended up carrying a power bank and a tiny external mic because the onboard mics pick up thumb taps and rustling when I hold the phone."
