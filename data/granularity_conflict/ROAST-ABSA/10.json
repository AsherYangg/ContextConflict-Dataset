        "source_1": "I started this specialization with just enough Python to script a few chores, and by the third course I had a small command-line bookmark manager and a web scraper that pulls book prices from two stores. The lessons on HTTP requests and parsing HTML were clear enough that I could adapt the examples to my own targets, and the intro database material helped me put together a tiny SQLite file with two tables for my app. It felt like a smooth runway from short exercises to something I could actually use at work.",
        "source_2": "Zooming in on the databases module: the coverage barely went beyond SELECT, simple WHERE clauses, and a single example of a JOIN. There was no discussion of indexes, constraints, or how to design tables for many-to-many relationships. The assignment let me pass with SELECT * and a loose schema, and the autograder didn’t flag inefficient queries. I ended up supplementing with a separate tutorial just to understand normalization and foreign keys before I could make sense of my scraper’s data.",
        "source_3": "My experience focuses on the platform itself. On Coursera, the video player kept dropping resolution mid-lecture even on stable Wi‑Fi, and downloads to the mobile app stalled or showed as “queued” for days. Twice, quiz submissions spun at 99% and then kicked me back to the quiz without saving. Support replied with a generic checklist and the certificate for one course showed up more than a week after completion. None of this touched the lecture content, but it added a lot of friction.",
        "source_4": "I only care about the Python explanations: they linger on variables, loops, and list slicing for several hours with many near-identical examples. For someone already comfortable writing small scripts, the pace makes it hard to pick out new ideas. I was hoping for coverage of packaging a tool, logging, or testing practices, but the segment stops at basics and brief functions, so I skipped ahead and still didn’t find much beyond beginner material.",
        "source_5": "Taking the whole track end to end, I built a command-line to‑do app that reads from a CSV and later migrated it to SQLite, plus a scraper that gathers article titles from two sites. The sequence ties together requests, parsing, and a touch of database work, which helped me ship something. At the same time, the jump between topics feels abrupt: one week you’re poking endpoints, the next you’re expected to design tables without much guidance, so I often leaned on external docs to bridge the gaps.",
        "source_6": "Narrowing to grading and feedback: the peer review system felt unpredictable. One reviewer approved my project with a one‑line “works,” another failed it because my argparse flags didn’t match the sample output exactly, even though the program met the stated requirements. Questions in the forum sat unanswered for days, and I didn’t see a TA step in to clarify rubrics. Extension options were tied to the paid calendar, which made scheduling tricky around work."
