        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in early May. Our fourth-floor room had a window looking toward a smaller dome—definitely not the main cathedral—and you could see the terracotta roofline from the bed. The bathroom looked newly fitted with a glass shower and modern fixtures, and the lift got us and our two suitcases upstairs without a hitch. There was someone at reception when we came back around 1 a.m. Breakfast was included: several cheeses, salumi, fresh bread, sweet pastries, and short espresso shots from the bar. We sat in the lounge for an hour before dinner, and it was a three-minute walk to Piazza del Duomo.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on breakfast only. “Included” meant a modest spread the two mornings I was there: a couple of basic cheese slices, some ham, bread that seemed from the day before, and pastries in plastic wrappers. The espresso came from a push-button machine, and when I asked for a second cup, the staff pointed me to a price list. If breakfast matters to you, this might not be enough on its own.",
        "source_3": "I booked specifically for the room view. Our room faced an interior courtyard, and the only way to see a dome was to lean out the window and look hard to the left—definitely not the famous one on the postcards. I asked to switch and was told the hotel was full for the weekend, so the “view” didn’t pan out for us.",
        "source_4": "Overall take from a two-night stay: being so close to the Duomo meant constant foot traffic and street noise; even with the window closed, music carried up until around midnight, and the bells started early. The bathroom in our room had a cracked tile and a wobbly towel rack, so it didn’t look recently updated. The lift fits two people at best, so moving luggage took several trips. Check-in stretched to about twenty minutes while the night clerk handled multiple calls. The bar and lounge felt more like overflow seating, and I rarely saw anyone using it.",
        "source_5": "I’m reviewing just the reception team. We arrived at 10 a.m., and they stored our bags, marked a route on a city map, and suggested a quieter spot for a sunset view. On departure day at 4:45 a.m., the night receptionist had a taxi waiting and handed us a small to-go bag with a croissant and juice. Each time we passed the desk, they greeted us by name and remembered our room number, and the desk was staffed whenever we came in late."
