        "source_1": "I took the course over four weeks after work and appreciated how the schedule fit around my day. Week 1 laid out definitions with short, crisp videos; Week 2’s growth models used simple charts I could replay at 1.25x; Week 3 framed policy trade-offs with mini case questions; and the final project had me write a memo on education spending in my city. The weekly checklists, downloadable readings, and end-of-week recap clips made it easy to keep momentum.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically to see how the material applies outside North America and Europe, but most examples leaned on the usual suspects. In the urbanization module, the transit section compared New York to London, with a quick nod to Tokyo, and skipped Bogotá’s BRT or Mexico City’s air quality program. When I asked in the forum about Latin America and Southeast Asia, the thread sat for days before a TA replied they’d “collect suggestions for the next run.”",
        "source_3": "Zooming in on the data statistics portion: the “Data Lab” in Week 4 promised a step-by-step walk‑through, yet the CSVs had unlabeled columns and the link to the R notebook returned a 404. The lecture mentions running a t‑test, but there’s no live demo; I ended up building confidence intervals in Excel after watching unrelated YouTube clips. The auto‑graded quiz then used a medical trial dataset we hadn’t practiced with, and one item required interpreting a p‑value the course never explained clearly.",
        "source_4": "As an overall judgment, I finished the syllabus but felt the flow wobbled. Week 2 jumped into models before defining some terms that only appeared in Week 3, and the capstone asked for a policy memo using indicators we never calculated in the exercises. Peer review windows overlapped with timed quizzes, and I spent a surprising amount of time deciphering instructions and re-reading the rubric to make sure I hadn’t missed a hidden requirement.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on the developed vs. developing country framing: the lecturer contrasts tax incentives in France with informal market dynamics in Kenya and Bangladesh, then brings in a Ghana clinic staffing case and an India microfinance timeline. The way they separate what works in high-capacity administrations from what’s feasible in low-resource settings helped me draft a grant proposal; I literally copied the evaluation rubric and adapted the metrics section for our sanitation pilot."
