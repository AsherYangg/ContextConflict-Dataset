        "source_1": "I stayed two nights at the Chealsea Lodge and left wishing I’d booked elsewhere. My room (204) barely had a foot of space around the bed, the TV picture was full of snow on several channels, and the shower swung from stinging hot to ice-cold within a minute. A pipe in the corner let out a high-pitched whistle after midnight that made it hard to nod off. The housekeepers greeted me kindly in the hallway, but when I asked the front desk about switching rooms, I was told they were “fully committed” and handed earplugs instead.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on the TV, because that’s what mattered to me after a long workday. The set in my room picked up maybe a dozen channels, and the sports broadcast I wanted had ghosting and a rolling line through the picture like an old VCR. The remote lagged between button presses, and even after the front desk sent up fresh batteries, the reception stayed fuzzy. If you rely on channel surfing to unwind, plan on streaming from a laptop.",
        "source_3": "Shout-out to housekeeping: Maria on the fourth floor made my mornings easier. She noticed I was running before breakfast and started leaving an extra towel and a couple of water bottles without my asking. When I misplaced a scarf, she recognized it and brought it to my door before I even realized it was gone. Small gestures like that stood out.",
        "source_4": "I spent three midweek nights and had a smooth stay overall. My corner room was compact but laid out smartly, with a small desk where I could finish emails; the TV got the channels I wanted, and the shower ran hot with steady pressure. I slept through each night without hearing pipes or hallway noise, and the bed felt supportive. I asked for a late checkout and they added an hour without fuss, which helped me make an afternoon meeting.",
        "source_5": "The shower in my room was a headache. The temperature jumped from scalding to chilly every 20–30 seconds, which made it impossible to settle into a rinse. I tried different times of day, thinking it might be peak demand, but the swing was there each time. I ended up washing my hair in the sink to avoid getting blasted.",
        "source_6": "I had the infamous pipe whistle in Room 310—like a tea kettle starting up around 10:45 p.m. I called the desk, and an engineer came up within ten minutes, listened, and said it was a known issue on that line. They moved me to 505 right away and brought a new key to the door; the second room was quiet and I slept fine. They also slipped a breakfast voucher under the door the next morning as an apology."
