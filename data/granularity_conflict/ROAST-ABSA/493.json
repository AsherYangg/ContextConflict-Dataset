        "source_1": "I zero in on texture. Straight from the resealable bag, each cookie bends before it breaks and the center feels springy. After a day on the counter, they didn’t turn hard; I could press a thumbprint and it slowly bounced back. Ten seconds in the microwave made the chips melty and the edges stayed pliable instead of crisp. If you want a firm snap, these won’t give it; it’s a soft-baked chew all the way.",
        "source_2": "I bought them for the ingredient panel. Mine lists unbleached wheat flour, cane sugar, butter, eggs, chocolate, vanilla extract, and sea salt—no artificial dyes, no high‑fructose corn syrup. There is soy lecithin and “natural flavor,” and palm oil shows up mid‑list. Not organic, but the list is short and reads like a home pantry. One cookie is 120 calories with 9g sugar, for anyone counting.",
        "source_3": "I keep a bag in the pantry for after‑dinner cravings. They remind me of the cookies my aunt bakes: soft center, little pockets of melted chips, and that buttery aroma that hits when you open the seal. I brought them to a game night and two people asked if I made them from scratch. Great with coffee in the morning or dunked in cold milk.",
        "source_4": "I grabbed these thinking they’d work as a healthier afternoon bite, but they land squarely in treat territory for me. Two pieces are 240 calories and left me buzzing, and the portion felt small for that count. The batch I had crumbled in the bag and left a slick on my fingers, so they’re not something I’d toss in my work bag as a “better‑for‑you” snack.",
        "source_5": "I’m picky about flavor balance and focused on that alone. These lean very sweet, with the chips overwhelming the dough. I pick up a faint bottled‑vanilla note and not much salt to keep things in check. If you’re chasing that browned‑butter, bakery‑style depth, this doesn’t quite land there."
