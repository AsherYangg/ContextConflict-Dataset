        "source_1": "I signed up during a busy quarter at work and paid close attention to the time commitment. On average, I needed about 3–4 hours per week: the videos ran 8–12 minutes each, the weekly quiz took me around 15 minutes, and the one creative exercise was a short photo reflection that I could complete in a single evening. There were optional readings linked to museum blogs, but skipping them didn’t block progress. Deadlines were soft with the Coursera “catch-up” feature, so I never felt pressured to log in daily.",
        "source_2": "Looking at the course as a whole, I came away feeling it was well put together. The modules moved from the history of the medium into contemporary practice without jolts, and the interview segments helped me understand why an artist would choose documentary versus installation. The week that explored trash as subject matter reframed everyday objects for me, and the segment on architecture connected image-making to urban memory. I didn’t have a photography background going in, and the pacing made it easy to follow along without feeling lost.",
        "source_3": "I want to focus on the week with the videos about picking up litter and arranging it for display. The camera followed the artist collecting items, photographing them, and setting up a gallery wall, but the conversation never clarified whether this was meant to read as documentary work, an aesthetic exercise, or a critique of consumption. When the interviewer had a chance to probe, they defaulted to general prompts like “tell us about your process,” so the underlying message stayed fuzzy. I finished that week unsure what I was supposed to take away beyond the mechanics of the setup.",
        "source_4": "The architectural preservation discussion deserves its own comment. I appreciated hearing about photographing buildings as a way to record changing neighborhoods, but the interview wandered from heritage to tourism and then to equipment choices without a clear thread. As someone studying urban design, I hoped for concrete case studies—facade retention versus full restoration, how long-term image archives influence planning decisions—but the questions stayed broad. It felt like the artist had more to share if only they’d been steered into specifics.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled primarily for the early history units, and those didn’t land for me. The timeline zipped from daguerreotypes to gelatin silver in a single video, major figures were name-checked without context, and the assignment to annotate family album photos didn’t push beyond surface-level observations. I kept waiting for deeper dives into preservation methods—how storage conditions affect emulsions, or strategies for digitizing fragile prints—and instead got a brief overview that felt like prep for a high school survey class.",
        "source_6": "From a workload standpoint, I found this tougher than expected. Between two peer reviews every week, forum participation thresholds to unlock the next quiz, and external readings linked to museum archives, I spent 8–10 hours to keep pace. The week 6 project took multiple outings to collect materials, a separate session to shoot and edit, and a 700-word reflection that required citations. With fixed quiz windows and peer-review queues, slipping a day made the next week feel stacked, so managing deadlines became its own task."
