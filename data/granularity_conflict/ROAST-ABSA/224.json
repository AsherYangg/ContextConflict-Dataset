        "source_1": "I specifically tested heat on my iPhone 13 because I game a lot. Thirty-minute sessions of Genshin Impact at 60 fps with brightness around 75% (Wi‑Fi on, Spigen Liquid Air case) make the back near the camera bump feel warm, but I can keep my grip without fidgeting. Frame rate stays steady and I don’t see the screen dim. Indoors at 22°C, a 12‑minute 4K60 video clip had my IR thermometer reading about 40–41°C on the glass, which felt toasty but not hand‑scalding.",
        "source_2": "Talking only about price and value: I paid INR 64,900 for the 128 GB model in Bangalore, traded my two‑year‑old OnePlus 7 for INR 15,500, and got a bank cashback of INR 4,000. Effective cost landed around INR 45,400. After nine months, Cashify quoted INR 38,000 for buyback, so the depreciation has been gentler than my past Android phones. Spreading the net cost over that period, the monthly outlay felt reasonable for me.",
        "source_3": "Overall take after two months: during BGMI at 90 fps, the phone heats up in 10–15 minutes to the point where I need to put it down, and the backplate feels almost burning around the top-left. Recording 4K60 at a kids’ birthday party, the screen dimmed after about 12 minutes and the camera app pushed a temperature warning, forcing a break. On crowded metro rides, holding it without a case gets uncomfortable once it warms up, and the battery drops fast under these conditions. I paid full retail at launch and the glossy marketing didn’t match what I experienced day to day.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on the processor only: the A15 flies through my workload. I batch‑edited 30 RAW photos in Lightroom and the export finished in under two minutes, while Spotify and Safari (about 25 tabs) sat in the background without reloads. Multitasking between Slack calls, Notion, and Google Sheets feels instant, and rendering a 4K vlog in CapCut took 7 minutes for a 9‑minute timeline. Apps launch quickly and I haven’t run into stutters.",
        "source_5": "Usability and comfort in hand: with the Apple silicone case, the flat sides are easy to grip and the 6.1‑inch size is manageable for my small hands. I read on Kindle for 45–60 minutes at night and take long calls without finger fatigue, even on commutes. Navigation in the car warms it a bit after an hour, but the phone remains comfortable to hold when I pick it up from the mount.",
        "source_6": "Overall impression after a year coming from a Pixel 4a: battery gets me through a full workday with Slack, Outlook, and an hour of maps, typically ending around 20–25%. Weekend trip included multiple 4K clips (5–8 minutes each) and lots of photos; the phone warmed up but never forced a stop. iOS updates arrived on day one, and the handoff with my Mac has been convenient for calls and notes. The sticker price was steep, but with a trade‑in and EMI, the purchase has worked out well for me."
