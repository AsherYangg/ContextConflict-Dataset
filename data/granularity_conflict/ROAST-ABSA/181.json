        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on the cost here. My box had 24 small cookies and ran me $24.99, plus nearly seven bucks for shipping, so I was into it for about thirty-two dollars. That’s roughly $1.30 per cookie, not counting the serving tray I still had to buy. My local bakery sells holiday cookies at $9.99 per dozen, larger and with custom designs. For stocking a big office platter, this price point stretched my party budget more than expected.",
        "source_2": "Convenience-wise, these didn’t really save me time. The package arrived with dry ice, and the cookies were stuck to the wax paper separators, so lifting them off smeared the frosting. The instructions said to thaw at room temp; after 90 minutes the centers were still chilly, and condensation left the decorations a bit damp. I ended up re-plating and blotting each piece with a paper towel. At that point, a quick run to the grocery bakery would have been simpler.",
        "source_3": "On taste/texture alone: several cookies were crumbly around the edges but oddly dense in the middle, and the icing had a sharp, artificial vanilla note that lingered. Two had a slight freezer-bite flavor. My kids each took a bite and moved on to the brownies, and I noticed half the peppermint-topped ones were still on the tray at the end of our movie night. If you’re buying strictly for flavor, these didn’t hit the spot for us.",
        "source_4": "I put these out at our neighborhood holiday open house and they were gone by the end of the second hour. The mix of shapes looked cheerful on a red platter, and I didn’t have to preheat an oven or wash mixing bowls—just peeled off the packing sheets and arranged them. The sugar cookie base was soft, and the peppermint chip ones were the first to disappear. Several guests asked where I ordered them from. They cost more than grocery store options, but the time saved the day before the party made it an easy decision, and I’d add them to my December routine again.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression, they photograph nicely—bright icing, cute trees and stars—but the presentation didn’t hold up for serving. A few arrived with cracked corners, and once thawed, the colors bled slightly into the white frosting. The cookies are on the small side, so people took two, then left half of each on their plates, saying they were a bit much after the first few bites. Between the size, the cleanup from the frosting flakes, and the final bill, I’m likely to try a different option next time."
