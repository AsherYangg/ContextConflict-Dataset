        "source_1": "I booked two nights and, stepping off the elevator on the sixth floor, was hit by a stale odor in the corridor. The room had chipped veneer on the dresser, a sagging desk chair, and a bathroom sink that left a slow puddle under the vanity. When I asked the front desk about switching rooms, the agent said they were full and looked past me to the next guest. At 2 a.m., the steady drip from the bathroom kept me awake. This place feels like it should be closed for a proper renovation before selling any more nights.",
        "source_2": "I only interacted with the staff, as I arrived late and left early, and they were the highlight of my stay. The night manager, Luis, checked me in within minutes, offered bottled water, and helped me rekey when I demagnetized my card. In the morning, the front desk printed my boarding pass and neatly tagged my bag for storage while I grabbed breakfast across the street. Everyone I spoke to was patient and attentive, even with a small line forming.",
        "source_3": "My focus is the bathroom in room 512. The shower handle had to be nudged just right or it would send a constant trickle down the wall, and the grout around the tub was cracked with darkened caulk. After a quick rinse, water pooled near the base of the toilet and crept under the bathmat. I called maintenance; they tightened a fitting and mopped, but by evening there was a damp ring around the toilet again and a faint glugging sound from the sink trap.",
        "source_4": "If you’re sensitive to smells, the third-floor corridor was rough. The hall outside 318 had a mix of mildew and heavy citrus cleaner, and two box fans were running near the ice machine with a dehumidifier humming by the stairwell. Each time the elevator doors opened, the odor met you head-on. Inside my room it was better with the window cracked, but walking to the vending machine left the scent clinging to my clothes.",
        "source_5": "I spent most of my time in the room working and found it functional. The king bed was supportive, blackout curtains actually blocked the morning sun, and the desk had enough surface area and two handy USB ports on the lamp. The decor leans retro—brass lamps, patterned carpet—but the A/C held a steady temperature and the TV inputs worked with my HDMI cable. I didn’t notice any hallway odor on my floor, and for a single overnight work trip it covered the basics."
