        "source_1": "I took this poetry course to refresh basics, and ended up finishing it in four weeks. The first module walked through sound devices using concrete clips, including Phil Ochs’s rendition of The Bells, which the instructor used to illustrate how repetition works across stanzas. Weekly assignments nudged me to produce two new drafts, and I got thorough line notes on one of them. The instructor posted short check-ins that clarified expectations, and the pacing fit into about an hour a day for me.",
        "source_2": "I’m only reviewing the peer workshop component. The rubric rewards hitting a word count, so a lot of feedback I received was padded with generalities like “nice imagery” without line-specific suggestions. Two of the required three reviews for my poem arrived past the deadline, and one reviewer clearly misread the scansion criterion and marked stresses at random. My piece ended up with a middling score that didn’t reflect the written comments. If you’re joining primarily for critique, the workshop felt too inconsistent for me.",
        "source_3": "I focused on the supplementary media, especially the section on The Bells. I’d never heard Phil Ochs’s version before, and the lesson pauses right at “tintinnabulation” to highlight the echoing consonants. I looped that segment a few times and jotted timestamps in my notes. On desktop the links opened inside the player; on the mobile app they kicked me out to YouTube, which was a small detour but workable. That single example helped me hear the patterns better than the slides did.",
        "source_4": "As a complete newcomer, I struggled with the overall flow. Terms like caesura and trochee were thrown in quickly, and the glossary entries were short, so I found myself pausing and rewinding a lot. Week two’s assignment asked us to scan a stanza, but the input field didn’t support the stress marks I use, and the forum thread about it went unanswered for days. The Coursera app also froze twice during longer videos. I stopped submitting after the second week because I couldn’t keep up.",
        "source_5": "I’m only addressing the scansion module. The live demonstration over The Bells was clear: the instructor marked stresses in real time and explained where the rhythm intentionally slips. The downloadable worksheet matched the video, which made practice straightforward. The auto-grader, however, docked me heavily when I used a UK pronunciation for certain words; after comparing with a classmate, it seems the answer key expects an American pattern, and there’s no way to note dialect differences.",
        "source_6": "I completed the whole course and came away with a workable routine: read, annotate, draft, workshop, revise. My three assigned peers averaged around 250 words each in their feedback, and one person even left tracked changes in a shared doc, which helped me tighten a stanza. The certificate showed up within a day of passing. The only friction I hit was captions in week three being about two seconds out of sync, but otherwise the content fit neatly into my evenings."
