        "source_1": "I only used the restaurant for breakfast and wish I’d skipped it. The buffet ran about $16 before tax, and the scrambled eggs were dry by 8:30 a.m. The bacon sat in a tray slick with grease, the melon was under-ripe, and the coffee tasted weak even after a refill. The next morning I walked two blocks to a corner café on 3rd and spent half as much on a fresh croissant and a cappuccino that actually woke me up.",
        "source_2": "I stayed two nights in July and used the place as a base for sightseeing. I arrived from the airport around 10 a.m. and the front desk found me a room without any fuss. They handed me a map, circled a walking route to Pike Place, and pointed out a couple of bus lines. The walk to the market took me about 10 minutes at an easy pace. I parked in the underground garage for $16 per day, which was straightforward with an elevator directly to the lobby. The room itself was spotless, the AC kept a steady temperature, and the TV setup had enough channels for a quiet evening. I skipped the restaurant and grabbed coffee nearby. For what I needed—sleep, shower, and a place to stash my bag—it delivered.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on room layout: my queen room on the 4th floor was tight. There was barely space to open a large suitcase at the foot of the bed without blocking the bathroom door, and the closet was shallow, so jackets rubbed the sliding door. The desk was wedged beneath the wall-mounted TV, which made it awkward to use a laptop and mouse. Housekeeping kept surfaces dust-free and the bathroom wiped down, but if you plan to spend time indoors, the cramped floor plan is noticeable.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about front-desk service, and they handled my odd schedule well. I landed from a red-eye and showed up before noon; they tagged my bags, then called me 30 minutes later to say a room had opened. The receptionist printed bus directions to the Seattle Center, circled a couple of lunch spots on a map, and arranged for a small package I was expecting to be held at the desk. Check-in and check-out were both quick, and questions were answered without that rushed, scripted vibe.",
        "source_5": "I booked it thinking “downtown,” but it’s a few long blocks and the walk back is uphill, which felt longer after an evening at the waterfront. I tried the on-site breakfast once and pushed most of it around the plate; the bill didn’t match what was on the table. My room faced an alley, and the window unit cycled loudly through the night. The second morning I bailed on the restaurant and grabbed a latte and yogurt at a nearby coffee shop before catching the light rail.",
        "source_6": "I chose this spot because I needed secure parking. The garage entrance is around the back; the ramp is a bit tight, and the spaces are on the compact side—I had to fold the mirrors on my minivan to feel comfortable. The daily rate was $16, paid at the desk and linked to the room key, and the elevator from the garage to the lobby made unloading simple. Coming back late felt safe since the gate stayed closed and you needed a key to enter."
