        "source_1": "I’ve been ordering Newman’s Own Organic Raisins on a recurring schedule for a year, and as an overall experience they’ve been steady: the bags show up without drama, the raisins taste consistent from bag to bag, and the resealable zipper has held up through a dozen openings. I switched from the co-op bulk bins and Trader Joe’s after doing a side-by-side for baking; in my oatmeal cookies and cinnamon swirl bread, these hydrate evenly without turning the dough gray, and I don’t run into odd flavors or a trail of oil on my fingers. For a household that packs school lunches and bakes on weekends, the predictability plus doorstep delivery has been easy to live with.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on price/value: the last two orders were 15 oz bags at $5.79 each, which works out to about 39¢/oz. My local Trader Joe’s has a 16 oz bag at $3.99 (about 25¢/oz). Even when I stacked Subscribe & Save at 10%, the Amazon price only dropped to roughly 35¢/oz. If the goal is matching the TJ price, the math hasn’t lined up on my end unless there’s a rare sale.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on packaging/freshness: two of the three bags in my recent shipment had zippers that wouldn’t align after the second opening, and the top seam started to split at the corner. Once air got in, the top layer of raisins turned leathery within a week, with little sugar crystals forming and a few tiny stem bits showing up. I had to move everything into mason jars to keep the moisture in, and even after soaking for a muffin recipe, some pieces stayed tough around the edges.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take from a heavy snacker: I keep a bag on my desk and another in the pantry for the kids’ lunchboxes, and the experience has been reliable—uniform size, deep grape flavor without a sulfur note, and no sticky glaze that clings to fingers. The color runs true across the bag, I’m not hitting gritty bits, and I’ve yet to bite down on a cap or stem. Shipping boxes have been intact, and the best-by dates have given me several months of cushion, so I don’t feel rushed to finish a bag.",
        "source_5": "Looking only at delivery logistics: Prime quoted two days, but my last order took five and sat on the porch in 90°F sun. The raisins arrived warm, with condensation inside once they cooled indoors, and a few clumped together until I chilled the bag. A previous shipment came in a thin mailer instead of a box and got bounced around enough that the inner bag was wrinkled and compacted. The product itself can be fine, but the timing and packaging choices from the carrier have been unpredictable for me."
