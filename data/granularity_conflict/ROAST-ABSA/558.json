        "source_1": "I finished the third course in the Python for Everybody sequence with Dr. Chuck and used the assignments as a template to pull HTML with requests, parse it using BeautifulSoup, and clean the text with regex before feeding the data into my Android app. The weekly structure kept me moving, and the examples around working with JSON and SQLite were directly usable in my project. I audited first and later upgraded for the graded quizzes and certificate, which unlocked the auto‑grader and peer review features. I appreciated that I could watch lectures on my phone during commutes and then switch to my laptop for the programming tasks without losing my place.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the instructor’s explanations, especially around loops and list comprehensions, and often found myself replaying sections because the slides moved faster than the live coding. The transition from basic for‑loops to nested loops and comprehension syntax felt abrupt, with a jump from simple list building to more complex filtering in one lecture. In a couple of videos, the examples leaned on older datasets, and it wasn’t always clear how to adapt them to my own files. I relied heavily on the transcripts and timestamps to find the exact moment a concept was introduced, but the pacing made note‑taking tricky.",
        "source_3": "I joined because the page highlighted free access, and while auditing did let me watch everything, the graded quizzes, programming assignments, and certificate were behind the subscription. I tested the seven‑day trial and learned you need to cancel manually or it rolls into a monthly charge; mine posted at $49 after I missed the cutoff by a day. Financial aid was an option, but my application took about three weeks to get a response, which overlapped with the sessions I wanted to complete. In the end, I paid for a month to unlock the auto‑grader and complete the specialization checkpoints.",
        "source_4": "On the platform side, I used the Coursera Android app almost exclusively and was able to download videos over Wi‑Fi and watch them offline without stutters. The video player remembered where I paused, and the “notes” feature let me bookmark moments in the lecture to revisit later from my laptop. Weekly reminders kept the deadlines visible, and the discussion boards surfaced relevant threads when I searched for “regex” and “JSON decoding.” The only hitch I noticed was that push notifications were a bit frequent, so I adjusted settings to keep them from pinging me during work hours.",
        "source_5": "I completed the first two courses smoothly but hit friction in the third when the auto‑grader flagged whitespace and minor formatting issues that didn’t affect program output. Some exercises referenced modules and behaviors that matched earlier Python versions, so I spent time reconciling examples with my current 3.x environment. The forum had helpful threads, though my question about list slicing sat for several days before anyone chimed in. After a couple of weeks juggling environment tweaks and resubmissions, I decided to pause the specialization and switch to a book for that specific topic."
