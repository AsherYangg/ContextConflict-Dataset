        "source_1": "I’m only commenting on battery life. With two SIMs active, brightness around 40%, and my usual routine (about an hour of calls, 90 minutes of YouTube, and a couple of hours of WhatsApp/Instagram), I take it off the charger at 6:30 a.m. and usually plug back in around 11 p.m. with roughly 25–35% left. Standby drain overnight is about 3–4% for me. On lighter days, I can skip a night and charge the following morning without anxiety.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the camera: outdoors at noon, it handles signs and landscapes well enough for sharing—colors stay consistent, but dark areas lose detail, and faces look a bit soft if you pinch to zoom. Indoors at my kid’s birthday under warm bulbs, motion blur crept in unless I held the phone very steady, and grain showed up in the background. Tapping to focus helps, but chasing a moving toddler led to a lot of misses. Video picks up hand shake easily since there’s no stabilization, so I had to lean the phone on a table for steadier clips.",
        "source_3": "I set this up for my mom, who only wanted calls, WhatsApp, and a bit of Facebook. The initial setup took about 15 minutes, and I put the most-used apps on the first screen with larger icons. Since there’s no fingerprint unlock, she uses a simple PIN and hasn’t complained about it. She makes a handful of short calls, sends photos to the family group, and watches devotional clips on Wi‑Fi in the evening; the battery gets her through a day and a half. When she jumps between WhatsApp and the gallery, there’s a brief pause before images appear, but she doesn’t multitask much and doesn’t play games, so it hasn’t caused friction.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on performance and memory: with 2 GB of RAM, apps don’t stay resident. If I have Chrome and Telegram open, switching back to Chrome often forces a page reload. The keyboard sometimes takes a beat to pop up in messaging apps. Streaming Spotify while opening the camera produces a hiccup in the music. I tried BGMI; it booted after a long load and dropped frames heavily in the tutorial. Asphalt wouldn’t run reliably—either refused to start or stuttered to the point of being unusable for me.",
        "source_5": "As a main phone for work and play, it didn’t fit my routine. No fingerprint sensor means I’m typing a PIN every time, which adds friction when I just want to check a notification. Charging from 15% to full with the included charger takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes in my tests. On the weekend, Asphalt 9 crashed mid‑race, and Call of Duty Mobile chugged even at the lowest settings. Photos from a dim restaurant came out smeared, and the candlelight shots of a cake lacked detail. During the workday, bouncing between Gmail, Slack, and Chrome caused frequent app reloads, so I relegated it to backup duty for calls and kept my other device for everything else."
