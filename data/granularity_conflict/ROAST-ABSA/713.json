        "source_1": "I’ve bought this brand for years, and when I had to cut back on sodium I grabbed the reduced-salt bag hoping it wouldn’t feel like a compromise. It still tastes like real potatoes, not just oil and air, and the crunch is loud enough that my dog comes running every time I open a bag. I took it to a picnic and used the chips as scoops for chunky guacamole; they didn’t fold or turn soggy even after a few minutes on the plate. After a sandwich at lunch, I didn’t feel the urge to reach for the shaker, which is new for me.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on flavor: in a side-by-side with the regular version, these came across as faint. The first bite reminded me of a plain baked potato without the usual pop; I found myself adding hot sauce to wake them up. The potato does peek through, but the seasoning is so light that the taste disappears quickly, and a second handful felt like more texture than flavor.",
        "source_3": "Only talking about texture here. I opened the bag while watching a game and did a quick “snap test” on a few chips: clean break, no bend, and that crisp crack you get with kettle-cooked styles. I dipped them in hummus and salsa and they held together without turning mushy. Even after the bag sat open on the coffee table for about half an hour, the chips still had a firm bite instead of getting leathery.",
        "source_4": "As a weeknight snack, these didn’t land for me because the experience around the chips felt off. My last two bags were heavy on oil with a faint stale pantry smell right when I opened them, and I ended up with shiny fingers after a small bowl. The bag looked full but settled to a third once poured out, and close to a third of the chips were short shards that couldn’t hold a dip. I’m watching my salt, but I’d rather have fewer chips that feel fresher.",
        "source_5": "I’m on a 1,500 mg sodium plan and bought these because the label shows 65 mg per 28 g serving. I weighed out 56 g for a turkey wrap lunch, and it still kept me under my noon target. The neat thing is I didn’t feel punished by the switch—no need to add table salt after tasting them. My spouse, who likes a bolder punch, called them “plain,” but for me they fit the numbers without turning snack time into a chore.",
        "source_6": "Looking at overall flavor and aroma, this batch had a toasted potato note that reminded me of oven-roasted slices, with a little sweetness from the potato itself. There isn’t that sharp hit you get from a heavier sprinkle, but the taste builds across a few chips and lingers instead of washing out. Paired well with cheddar and apple slices, where the chips brought crunch without overwhelming the other stuff on the plate."
