        "source_1": "I finished the math course in five weeks while working full time. The modules were short enough to watch during a commute, and I could follow the diagrams and narration without rewinding much. Sequences and series, which used to be a blur for me, started to click after the examples on p‑series and alternating series. The weekly schedule nudged me to keep up, and the final quiz on power series radius of convergence tied the earlier ideas together. I ended up using the ratio test on a coding project that analyzed signal decay and got the same threshold the instructor derived.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the videos because I mostly learn by watching, but the production distracted me. On my laptop the handwriting in Week 3, Video 4 was small, and the board glare washed out exponents. The audio level drifted between segments, so I kept adjusting the volume; a mic pop in the sequences introduction made me jump. Captions lagged by about two seconds in several places, and in the ratio test walkthrough the annotations switched from n to k halfway through, which made note‑taking messy.",
        "source_3": "I took the quizzes twice each week just to see how far I could push my reasoning. Instead of one‑step exercises, several questions chained ideas: compare the ratio and root tests on the same series, then justify the choice with a bound. Numerical entries required tolerance around 1e‑3, and I had to compute partial sums in a small Python script to be sure. The feedback showed which subparts failed without giving away the path, so I ended up sketching proofs in the margin before submitting.",
        "source_4": "I signed up to refill some rusty calculus, but the topic order threw me off. After a quick refresher on limits, the course jumped into epsilon‑N definitions and proofs with little bridge, then later circled back to applied tests. Examples moved fast enough that I was pausing every minute to check algebra. The discussion forum threads I saw went unanswered for days. By the end of Week 2, after two quizzes where key conditions were easy to miss, I withdrew and looked for a different option.",
        "source_5": "The activities with peer review were the sticking point for me. One task asked for any valid method to confirm convergence; I used a comparison, cited bounds, and got marked down because a reviewer expected the integral test. The rubric listed both, yet the only feedback I received was a single sentence with no pointers. Appeal windows closed before I could get a second look, and the score reduction affected the course certificate threshold even though my math checked out."
