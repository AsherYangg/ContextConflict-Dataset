        "source_1": "I keep reading that there are lots of flavors, but over the past three months I’ve only been able to find Original, Espresso, and a rotating seasonal at two different coffee stands in Portland. The Amazon listing shows a grid of eight, yet half are “temporarily unavailable” every time I check out. I even wrote down dates—June 5, July 2, and August 11—and it was the same story: original in stock, two options out of stock, the rest hidden behind a “notify me” button. A local barista told me they stopped carrying peanut butter because the supplier couldn’t keep it in regular rotation. If there really are many varieties, they’re not consistently on shelves where I shop.",
        "source_2": "I’ve been eating these since the saran-wrap-and-sharpie label days, and the current batch doesn’t land the same for me. The spice is milder now—less cinnamon and clove—and the oats feel finer, so the texture leans crumbly instead of chewy. I compared two recent boxes (best-by 10/12 and 11/02): both smelled less toasty when opened, and the bite didn’t have that sticky, molasses-y pull I remember. The ingredient panel lists canola oil and chicory fiber; I’m pretty sure the older ones used a different fat and more brown sugar. It fills me up, but the flavor reads flatter than the early versions I used to grab at the kiosk by my bus stop.",
        "source_3": "I tested both sizes back-to-back: the 1.8 oz “snack” and the 4 oz “meal” cookie. The small one was gone in three bites on my commute; I was hungry again before I parked. The large one does have heft, but splitting it isn’t tidy—once you break it in half, it sheds crumbs everywhere and the halves never feel equal. I tried sharing on a hike with my partner, and the chunk I handed over kept sloughing off into the trail mix bag. For context, the nutrition panel lists ~210 calories for the small and ~430 for the large, which makes the gap feel awkward if you’re trying to land somewhere in the middle.",
        "source_4": "The newer wrappers look slick, but they haven’t held up in my deliveries. On my last order, two cookies arrived with the seals loose on one corner, and one had a tacky surface like moisture had condensed inside the film. The serrated tear notch doesn’t always open cleanly, so I end up ripping the sleeve down the side and showering my desk with crumbs. The date codes are faint and rub off easily; I had to tilt under a lamp to read them. The outer box had minimal padding, and several edges of the larger cookies were crumbled to gravel. The older saran-wrap style wasn’t pretty, but at least I could see the seal and avoid a soft, humid cookie.",
        "source_5": "I keep a variety pack in the pantry for rushed mornings, and they pair well with coffee. The original has a sturdy oat base, the espresso one wakes me up, and the cranberry-walnut adds a little tang. I like that I can grab a small one before the gym or split a big one on weekend hikes. They’re packed with seeds and nuts, so I don’t feel like I’m just eating a sugar bomb. The sweetness sits in the background rather than hitting first, which makes it easy to finish without needing a drink of water after every bite. When friends visit, the large cookie actually works as a quick two-person snack with a knife and a plate.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take: the ingredient list reads wholesome at first glance, but the sweetness creeps up on me. The chocolate chip version leaves a candy-bar echo that feels more dessert than breakfast, and my glucose monitor shows a sharper rise than I get with a homemade oat bar. There are lots of mix-ins—seeds, raisins, chips—which is fun, but a couple bites turn into a minefield of sticky bits that cling to molars. I also wish there were more savory-leaning options; everything skews to sweet spices or fruit. I still reach for them on road trips, yet for daily mornings I end up cutting them with plain yogurt to tame the sugar and texture."
