        "source_1": "I signed up mainly to see if the pacing would let me keep momentum after work, and it was a weird split: Weeks 1–2 crawled so slowly that I watched at 1.5x and still kept pausing out of boredom, then Week 3 jumped straight into hypothesis tests so abruptly that I had to rewatch at 0.75x. The switch from “mean/median” recaps to z-scores and p-values in a single lecture felt like shifting from a walk to a sprint. I spent two evenings just replaying the confidence interval section to catch all the steps. If you’re sensitive to speed changes, be ready to ride the playback controls a lot.",
        "source_2": "The content style didn’t click for me. Most lectures read off dense bullet lists with tiny formulas, and only after several slides would we see a worked example. I wanted more messy, real-world datasets with decisions explained step by step; instead, many examples were sanitized coin flips and dice. Even the intuition segments felt like definitions reworded, rather than stories that build from a question to a model.",
        "source_3": "I was looking for something that would get me over my nerves about stats, and this course did the trick. The instructor keeps the tone calm and practical, and the pacing let me finish two lessons per evening without feeling buried. The examples (like waiting times at a coffee shop and A/B tests on a website banner) made the formulas feel less abstract. I wrapped it up in three weeks and immediately started a follow-on course in regression without dreading the math anymore.",
        "source_4": "I completed every module and still didn’t feel ready to tackle the recommended “next step” courses. The quizzes rarely pushed beyond plug-and-chug, and I could pass without touching a dataset outside the provided toy numbers. Discussion replies took days, so when I got stuck on the sampling distribution intuition, I just moved on. The lectures themselves are smooth and easy to follow, but the overall package didn’t build enough muscle for applying the ideas on my own.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on assessments only: the autograder was fussy about formatting rather than reasoning. One question asked for a proportion rounded to three decimals, but answers with 0.842 vs 0.843 were treated inconsistently across different items. In another, I lost points because I wrote a correct inequality (“≥ n”) instead of the exact string the grader expected. I ended up spending more time second-guessing syntax and rounding rules than checking whether my statistical approach made sense."
