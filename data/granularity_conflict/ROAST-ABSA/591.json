        "source_1": "I picked this place strictly for the location. From the front door it was a 6-minute walk to my conference at the civic center, two blocks to the subway, and there’s a 24-hour diner across the street. I was in and out all day, grabbed coffee at the corner café, and never once needed a rideshare. If you’re planning to sightsee or catch shows, the theater district is under 10 minutes on foot.",
        "source_2": "About the room size: I’m 6'2\", and in 412 I could touch both side walls without stepping. The bed was wedged so close to the window that the curtains brushed my face when I sat up. The wardrobe doors stuck, the desk had scuffed edges, and the outlets were sparse—one behind the nightstand and one in the bathroom. The bathroom had a pedestal sink with no counter space; my toiletry bag had to live on the closed toilet lid.",
        "source_3": "I spent most evenings in the lobby because it felt like a living room. The staff put out complimentary wine around 5:30, and there were plenty of armchairs near outlets, so I caught up on emails with a glass in hand. Soft music, a bowl of olives and crackers, and a friendly hello every time I walked in made it a comfortable way to unwind before dinner.",
        "source_4": "For a weekend getaway with my partner, this didn’t land. Our room was so tight we had to take turns walking past the foot of the bed. The window unit hummed all night, the bathroom door scraped the tile, and the hallway outside echoed with rolling suitcases. We asked about a larger room but were told everything similar was full, so we made do, slept poorly, and left early each morning.",
        "source_5": "Solo trip on a budget, and I was content overall. Check-in took two minutes, I dropped my bag and was on my way to a matinee five blocks away. The room was compact but tidy, the shower ran hot quickly, and I liked grabbing a free glass of wine before heading back out. For a place to crash between museums and meals, this worked well, and I’d return for the convenience.",
        "source_6": "If building quirks matter to you, note the design: narrow hallways, low ceilings, and an old elevator that fits two adults plus a carry-on if you squeeze. The stair treads creak, doors have heavy brass knobs, and the carpets show patterns from decades past. It has a certain age to it—charm for some, but if you’re expecting modern lines and airy spaces, this isn’t that."
