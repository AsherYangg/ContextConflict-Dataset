        "source_1": "I finished this course over four weeks, squeezing in lectures during lunch. The segments on flock hierarchy, feather pecking, and enrichment changed how I watch my birds; after the dust-bathing lesson I added a sand/ash tray to the run and the afternoon scuffles dropped off. The case study on moving from cages to barn systems made me rethink perch placement and lighting in my small setup. The quizzes matched what was taught, and the farm footage kept it lively. I’ve already pointed two classmates in my animal science program to enroll.",
        "source_2": "I’m a backyard keeper with eight hens, and I struggled to apply the material to my situation. Most examples covered houses with 10,000 birds, automated egg belts, and climate-control software. Stocking density charts started at 1,000 birds per house; nothing on winterizing a small coop, predator-proofing a modest run, or managing a mixed-age flock of fewer than a dozen. Even the assignments had me calculating feed conversion and mortality across commercial batches, which felt out of place for a suburban shed and a manual feeder.",
        "source_3": "I took the course specifically for health prevention, and the instruction was detailed. The biosecurity lecture walked through setting up a boot bath and a two-week quarantine pen, with a downloadable checklist. There was a clear comparison of coccidiosis vaccination versus medicated starter, a demo of mite checks on wings and vents, and guidance on spotting early respiratory signs before they spread. I now keep a weekly log—Sunday coop clean, droppings tray inspection, and weight notes—to catch issues early.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on delivery quality: the structure felt uneven. Several videos repeated the same welfare indicator slide, then jumped to genetics without a segue. Audio levels varied—Week 2, Lecture 3 was so quiet I had to crank my speakers—while captions had distracting typos like “broiler” rendered as “boiler.” A couple of quiz items referenced numbers that never appeared on screen, so I found myself rewinding and pausing more than usual to piece things together.",
        "source_5": "From a commercial perspective, this lined up closely with my day job managing a broiler grow-out. The spreadsheet exercise mirrored the KPI dashboard we use—feed conversion, mortality, and stocking density benchmarks—and the welfare audit walkthrough matched our integrator’s checklists. It’s a strong fit for someone in production or ag study tracks. For a neighbor with a new backyard coop, I’d steer them toward a husbandry basics course first."
