        "source_1": "I took this Berklee production course over three weeks after work. The weekly layout made it easy to follow: short clips on MIDI vs. audio, a clear demo on building an 8‑bar drum loop, then a project where I arranged a simple verse/chorus in Ableton Live Lite. The section on EQ had me high‑passing guitars around 100 Hz and carving space for the kick, and the compression demo showed how a 4:1 ratio changed the drum bus punch. By the end I had a rough track with automation on a filter sweep and basic panning. I’ve already pointed two friends to it because the flow from concept to hands‑on was straightforward.",
        "source_2": "I focused on getting through the material without spending anything. Auditing gave me access to all videos, readings, and practice quizzes, and I watched everything on my phone during my commute. I used GarageBand on a 2017 MacBook and followed the assignment prompts anyway, even though I didn’t submit for a certificate. I posted my rough mix in the open forum and a couple of learners gave notes on the snare being too hot. For someone testing the waters, I reached the end of the syllabus and built a first song mockup without pulling out a card.",
        "source_3": "My experience centered on the cost structure. I tried the audit route, but the graded projects and peer reviews were locked unless I started a 7‑day trial that rolled into a monthly fee. The capstone walkthrough referenced rubrics I couldn’t view without enrolling, and the “submit for feedback” button stayed greyed out. Without access to the graded feedback loop, I couldn’t see model answers or detailed mix notes. I ended up pausing at week 3 because the parts that would actually tell me if I was on track lived behind the subscription.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on depth, the lessons skimmed over several essentials. The compression segment mentioned threshold and ratio but didn’t touch attack/release shaping or parallel routing, and there was no explanation of gain staging or keeping peaks around ‑6 dBFS. Signal flow felt rushed; I never saw a start‑to‑finish example of recording a vocal through an interface with proper input levels, low‑latency monitoring, and a clean path into the DAW. Some screenshots were from an older Pro Tools layout, which made it hard to match buttons in my current version. I finished the week on mixing still unsure how to set up buses for a reverb send.",
        "source_5": "Coming in as someone who’s produced a few EPs, I used this as a refresher and an overall check. The pace stayed slow, with a lot of time on terminology and the classic four‑on‑the‑floor groove. The peer‑review system worked, but responses took a couple of days, and the discussion board occasionally went quiet. On the tech side, the instructor mic clipped in a couple of segments, and captions mis‑labeled “sidechain” as “side chain” and “sine chain,” which threw me off searching the transcript. It’s structured enough for a first timer, but I ended up skipping sections I already knew."
