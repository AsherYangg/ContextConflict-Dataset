        "source_1": "I spent an evening just playing with home screen widgets because that’s my thing. On the stock launcher, I long-pressed the home screen, hit “Widgets,” and added the 4x2 weather, a calendar, and a notes widget. Each one matched exactly what I tapped in the chooser. No auto-substitutions, no random “smart” picks. I’m on version 13.0.5 of the OS, and the widget panel shows a clear preview and size before you place it. I also rearranged them and resized without any jolts or ghost taps. If the phone is picking widgets on its own for others, I wonder if they have “smart layout” or “suggested widgets” toggled on in the launcher settings, because I don’t see that behavior at all.",
        "source_2": "Strictly talking about what I paid: I grabbed this during a festival sale for 11,999 INR with a card offer, and the bundle included a basic case. At that price, I wasn’t expecting flagship polish. I get a decent screen for reading, calls are clear enough in my office basement, and the camera is okay for daylight errands. I wouldn’t shell out the full sticker price that shows up outside sale season, but at the discounted rate it lines up with what I use it for. If you’re comparing against models at 18–20k, sure, the finish and software niceties lag, but for a budget buy the trade-offs felt acceptable.",
        "source_3": "After two weeks, the device started acting like it had a mind of its own. When I try to add a widget, it pops up some “smart suggestion” panel and dumps a different widget on the screen than the one I chose. Adding app icons to the home screen is another rabbit hole: I tap “Add to Home,” it pretends to work, and nothing shows up. I end up digging through the app drawer every time. I’ve had random stutters while swiping between pages and one instance where the phone froze and then rebooted. This was my first time ordering a phone online, and the whole experience has felt off—like I’m fighting the interface instead of using it.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing only on the home screen icon behavior. Out of the box, I couldn’t get new app icons to appear even after installing from Play Store and tapping “Add to Home.” It turns out the default launcher had “Lock Home Layout” enabled by default. I toggled it off, and icons started appearing, though not always where I expected. I eventually installed Nova Launcher, and now I drag directly from the app drawer; it works most of the time. On two occasions, icons vanished after a restart, which I fixed by disabling “auto organize” and turning off battery optimization for the launcher. It’s usable once you adjust a few settings, but it’s picky.",
        "source_5": "I only care about battery life because I’m on the road. With dual SIM active, a couple of hours of maps, and WhatsApp calls, I routinely get around 6–7 hours of screen-on time. Overnight drain is 3–4% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. Using the bundled charger, it goes from 15% to 80% in roughly 35–40 minutes and tops off in just under an hour. The battery graph is steady without weird dips, and I don’t see sudden drops when switching between apps. I keep adaptive battery on and refresh social feeds occasionally; the phone stays cool unless I record long videos. For my daily routine, the endurance is right where I need it.",
        "source_6": "As an overall impression, mine has been straightforward. Setup took 20 minutes, data moved from my old phone with the migration tool, and I didn’t hit any snags. The system animations feel consistent, and the launcher respects my widget and icon choices—long-press, pick from the grid, place it, done. No random swaps or disappearing icons on my unit. I ordered online, got next-day delivery, and have used it for a month without strange behavior: calls, banking apps, and music streaming all work as expected. For casual use and a bit of photo snapping, it’s been a reliable daily carry, and my parents figured out the interface faster than I expected."
