        "source_1": "I stayed two nights for a weekend getaway and felt the location did a lot of the heavy lifting—five minutes on foot to the main square and close to a streetcar stop. Check-in was quick, the front desk greeted me warmly, and they handed me a printed list of nearby spots for breakfast. My room had playful decor, crisp sheets, and a mattress that didn’t sag at the edges. The nightly rate was under $100, which surprised me given the area. Only hitch: there wasn’t a coffeemaker in the room, so I had to grab my first cup in the lobby. Even so, I left thinking I got strong value and I’d book again.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the coffee setup: there’s no in-room coffeepot. At 6:00 a.m., I had to throw on shoes and head to the lobby for a cup from the urns. They were hot and regularly refilled, but creamers ran out fast during the morning rush, and there’s no kettle upstairs if you’re a tea person. If you need caffeine the moment you wake up, plan for a lobby run.",
        "source_3": "I booked it purely for the address, and it delivered. From the front door, it was a seven-minute walk to the museum, two blocks to a major bus line, and a small grocery about a block and a half away. I was able to pop back to my room between sights to drop off purchases without calling a rideshare. For anyone who likes to explore on foot, this location makes daily logistics simple.",
        "source_4": "I’m particular about sleep, so here’s a bed-only review. The queen mattress had a firm base with a softer top layer; no creaks when turning over, and the edges didn’t collapse when sitting. Pillows kept their loft through the night, and the sheets were clean with no stray hairs or lint. I woke up without a tight back or a sore neck, which is rare for me on the road.",
        "source_5": "As an early riser who answers emails before sunrise, the missing in-room coffeemaker became a real headache. I was up at 5:30, but the lobby urns weren’t set out until closer to six, and by the time I got a cup, my morning routine was already off-kilter. The staff were welcoming and the room looked tidy with cute touches, and the rate was easy on the wallet, but that one gap in the room amenities overshadowed everything else for my stay."
