        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the fast charging, and it delivers. With the included adapter, I can go from around 12% to full in roughly 20–25 minutes while I’m making breakfast. I don’t even bother charging overnight anymore—if I forget, a quick plug-in while I shower gets me set for the day. The phone gets a bit warm during the last few minutes, but it never feels uncomfortable to hold.",
        "source_2": "My gripe is the in-display fingerprint reader. It often takes a beat before the lock screen disappears, and I sometimes get a “try again” prompt on the first attempt. I deleted and rescanned my prints and even cleaned the glass thoroughly; the behavior didn’t change much. With a thin tempered glass, the delay feels slightly worse. Coming from a previous phone with a side-mounted sensor, I notice the slowdown every time I unlock.",
        "source_3": "After two weeks of daily use, the overall package has been solid for me. The screen makes photos and movies look crisp, and scrolling feels smooth. The battery lasts through a full workday, and if I’m low, a quick 20-minute top-up gets me back near full. It’s light enough that I forget it’s in my pocket on walks. The fingerprint unlock does hesitate occasionally, but it hasn’t stopped me from enjoying the phone; I just grabbed it during a festival sale to make the price easier to swallow.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the phone as a whole, the cost is what leaves me uneasy. The display pops and the charger is absurdly fast, and I appreciate how easy it is to carry, but the high sticker price overshadows those perks for me. The sluggish fingerprint unlock shows up multiple times a day, which adds to the frustration because it’s such a frequent interaction. Had the launch price been lower, I wouldn’t be second-guessing the purchase.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on battery endurance: with dual SIM active, push email, Slack, and about two hours of YouTube, I finish most days with 15–25% left. On heavier days with camera use and some gaming, I need a top-up around late afternoon, which the fast charger handles in one coffee break. Overnight drain sits around 3–4%. I haven’t seen any weird percentage drops or sudden shutdowns so far.",
        "source_6": "I zeroed in on the display quality before buying, and it’s been the standout. Colors look lively without turning faces orange, and tiny text stays sharp in Kindle and Chrome. In direct sunlight at noon, I can still read messages after nudging brightness near max. Watching 60 fps clips on YouTube shows smooth motion with minimal blur, which makes long commutes more bearable."
