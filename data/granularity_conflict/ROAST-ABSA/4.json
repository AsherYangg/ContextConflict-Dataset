        "source_1": "Bought a Realme phone from Amazon two weeks ago and it’s been acting strangely since day one. The device falls into a deep sleep: my 6:30 a.m. alarm only sounds after I hit the power button, and incoming calls don’t light up the screen until I wake it manually. I missed two calls from my bank and one from a courier because the phone just sat there on the table. I turned off Sleep Standby Optimization, gave Phone and Messages “unrestricted” battery access, disabled app battery optimizations, and even did a factory reset. The interface also drags—opening the camera takes 4–5 seconds and Chrome freezes on first load—so I requested a return through Amazon.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on performance: I have the 6/128 variant and app switching is slow. Telegram shows a blank screen for a second before chats appear, the Gboard keyboard lags while typing, and the Play Store stalls on “Installing…” even with 100 Mbps Wi‑Fi. I toggled off all animations in Developer Options, cleared cache, and tried a clean setup with no restored apps. Games like BGMI stutter in the lobby and the phone briefly locks up when a notification arrives. Compared to my older Redmi 5, this is slower in everyday tasks.",
        "source_3": "Overall, it works well for my routine. I use Jio VoLTE and calls connect quickly, the earpiece is loud enough on a busy street, and the battery comfortably covers a full day from 8 a.m. to midnight with Slack, Gmail, and Maps. The screen is bright outdoors and the fingerprint reader wakes it instantly. I keep Spotify playing while switching between Sheets and Drive, and nothing crashes. For navigation, payments, and quick photos of receipts, it behaves reliably.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on calls while idle: if the phone sits untouched for 10–15 minutes, the first ring frequently doesn’t show. I have to tap the power button and suddenly I see two or three missed calls at once. Delivery drivers assume I’m ignoring them. I double‑checked that Do Not Disturb is off, set the Phone app to “no restrictions” for battery use, and removed a third‑party cleaner. After updating to RMX…_13.1, the issue persists. Other features don’t bother me; this call wake problem is the deal‑breaker.",
        "source_5": "Picked this up during the sale and, after uninstalling bloat and updating firmware, mine runs smoothly. App launches feel immediate, scrolling at 90 Hz is fluid, and I haven’t missed a call—even after leaving it on the desk for hours, it rings right away. I handled a 90‑minute Zoom over 4G while navigating on Maps and streaming music to Bluetooth without a freeze. The only tweak I made was enabling “High Performance Mode,” and since then it’s been responsive in day‑to‑day use."
