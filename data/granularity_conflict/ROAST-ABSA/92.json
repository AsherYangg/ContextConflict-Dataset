        "source_1": "I’ve been tracking battery for two weeks. Typical day: 30 minutes of Google Maps, Spotify streaming on Bluetooth during commute, Slack and Gmail all day, about an hour split between Instagram and Reddit, 20 minutes of Call of Duty Mobile, and a few photos. With 120 Hz on and adaptive brightness, I end around 8–10% by 8 pm with roughly 4–4.5 hours of screen-on time. Overnight (Wi‑Fi on, no airplane mode) it drops 6–8%. Charging from 10% to 100% with the bundled 18 W brick takes just over two hours, and the phone warms up during longer gaming sessions.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on the interface: out of the box I counted 19 extra apps (Theme Store, Browser, Music, Game Center, etc.). About seven uninstall cleanly; several only disable, and two came back after a system update. I still get “recommendations” in the file manager unless I turn off a toggle buried three menus deep. The lock screen pushed a news card after I declined. Gesture navigation feels jittery when swiping home from heavy apps, and the recents screen sometimes drops frames. I ended up installing a third‑party launcher to keep things tidy.",
        "source_3": "Camera notes after a weekend trip: outdoor photos at noon look fine, but indoors at a cafe the autofocus hunts and faces look soft even with beauty set to 0. The shutter hesitates a beat, so my kid running toward me is often blurred. Night mode lifts shadows but smears brick texture and neon signs. 4K 30 fps video shows micro‑judder on slow pans, and stabilization crops more than expected. The selfie camera applies skin smoothing that I can’t fully disable.",
        "source_4": "Connectivity on my carrier (T‑Mobile, Seattle): no band 71 means my basement drops to “No Service” where a OnePlus 7T still makes calls. Walking downtown, calls get choppy when the phone flips between LTE and 5G. On an Asus Wi‑Fi 6 router, it reconnects a few times a day while other devices stay pinned. Dual‑SIM standby occasionally loses data after a subway ride until I toggle airplane mode.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after six weeks: the fingerprint reader misses about one in four unlocks unless I press harder than feels natural. Coming out of Genshin, the launcher reloads, Spotify pauses, and widgets redraw. Scrolling Twitter at 120 Hz shows periodic hitching. A 30‑minute Google Meet drops around 12% battery and warms the top half of the phone. The bottom speaker is easy to cover with a hand and sounds thin for podcasts. I moved my main SIM back to my older device for travel and left this on my desk for testing.",
        "source_6": "Overall experience after three months: daily apps (Outlook, Slack, Chrome with ~20 tabs) stay in memory, and an hour of Genshin at medium settings doesn’t trigger throttling or hot spots. With two SIMs active and Bluetooth connected to a Galaxy Watch, I usually finish work with around 40% left and see 7–8 hours of screen time on weekends. After disabling a few suggestion toggles during setup, I haven’t seen promo banners in system apps. On Vodafone UK, calls sound clear and 5G holds steady around my neighborhood. Daylight photos of kids and pets are crisp and shareable; in dim restaurants they’re usable for social posts but not something I’d print."
