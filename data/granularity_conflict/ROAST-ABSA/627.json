        "source_1": "I didn’t realize there’s no elevator. I arrived late with a 55‑lb suitcase and a backpack, and hauling everything up three flights took multiple trips. The stairwell is narrow with a tight turn between floors, and the carpeting on the steps is a little loose near the second landing. Housekeeping offered to carry my bag down at checkout, but at check‑in it was just me and the stairs. If your knees complain, this will matter.",
        "source_2": "I booked a third-floor unit and was surprised by how much room there was: a recessed alcove with a king bed, a separate living area with a long sectional couch, and an eating nook next to the kitchen. Two big windows faced a quiet side street in Queen Anne, and there was enough floor space to unroll a yoga mat without moving furniture. The trim work and lighting gave it a classic feel rather than a generic hotel box.",
        "source_3": "My plan was to cook simple meals, but the kitchen didn’t make that easy. There were two bent pans, no cutting board, a single dull knife, and no basics like oil, salt, or coffee filters. The mini-fridge cooled fine, though the freezer compartment frosted over. I ended up walking to a market on Queen Anne Ave to buy essentials just to make eggs in the morning.",
        "source_4": "I stayed three nights for a conference at Seattle Center and paid $118 per night booking direct. The building looks older from the outside, but my room had a large couch, a proper dining nook, and a king bed tucked into an alcove that felt private. The mattress was supportive and the linens clean. I could stroll to the Space Needle in under ten minutes. The only catch is stairs—no lift—so arriving with one bag was fine, but I wouldn’t try it with two large suitcases.",
        "source_5": "I wanted something charming in Queen Anne, but my studio ended up feeling cramped despite the photos. The couch sank in the middle, the bed creaked when I turned over, and the single window faced a wall, so the place was dim even at noon. The kitchen had three mismatched plates and no sponge, so I skipped cooking. Between the steep stairs and the nightly rate over $140, I kept thinking I should have booked in Belltown.",
        "source_6": "I’m mostly about numbers, and this rate worked for me. On a shoulder-season weekend I paid $102 before taxes, which in Queen Anne is lower than what I was seeing for comparable spots. No resort fee, and street parking was free after 6 p.m., so I wasn’t nickel-and-dimed. If you don’t mind climbing to the third floor, the overall cost felt more like an extended-stay apartment than a boutique hotel."
