        "source_1": "I brew Kenya AA in a V60 at a 1:16 ratio (18 g coffee to 288 g water) at around 200°F, and drink it black. The cup comes out clean with a bright, citrus edge and a rounded finish, even if I let the drawdown run a little long. What stands out is how smooth the last sips are; I don’t get that harsh bite I brace for with darker roasts. For anyone who usually adds cream to tame an aggressive cup, this one stays gentle enough without it.",
        "source_2": "As an everyday morning option, this sits squarely between dark, smoky blends and light, tea-like coffees. On my drip machine (Breville Precision Brewer), medium grind, gold filter, it’s consistent across a full pot and doesn’t coat the tongue with oil, so it plays nicely with milk and doesn’t gunk up the grinder. The bag I received was roasted within two weeks and the aroma was lively when I opened it. It’s become my weekday go-to because it’s easy to dial in and doesn’t require fussing.",
        "source_3": "The box calls these pods “extra bold,” but on my Keurig I have to brew at 6 oz to avoid a thin cup; the default 8–10 oz settings taste closer to a breakfast blend. If you gravitate toward French or Italian roasts, expect something milder here, with none of that heavy smoke. I ended up double-podding for a travel mug to get the punch I wanted, which isn’t ideal. The flavor is fine, but the strength rating on the packaging set the wrong expectation.",
        "source_4": "The printed scoop-to-water guide on the bag led me astray: 2 tablespoons per 8 oz gave me a pale, watery mug on my Mr. Coffee. Cutting the water to 6 oz or bumping the dose to a heaping 3 tablespoons brought the body back and the flavors snapped into focus. If you follow the line on a standard carafe without adjusting, it drinks like a weak diner brew. Once I ignored the diagram and tuned the ratio, it behaved, but the first impressions weren’t great.",
        "source_5": "Value-wise, my 12 oz bag ran $17, and at 20 g per 10 oz mug that’s only about 17 cups—roughly a dollar a mug before shipping. I also find I need a slightly heavier dose than with my usual Sumatran to reach the same strength, so the bag empties fast. If you drink multiple cups a day, plan on reordering frequently. The quality is fine, but the cost-per-cup creeps up compared with other options in my rotation.",
        "source_6": "I may be the outlier, but brewing this Kenya AA in a Moccamaster on the “half carafe” setting (medium-fine grind) gives me a dry finish with a sharp edge, especially once it cools. Pushing the dose higher to get more body also pushes that aftertaste forward for me. Switching to a coarser grind helped a bit, yet I still pick up a lingering bite that I don’t get from my usual medium roasts. If you’re sensitive to that kind of finish, you might want to keep the ratio conservative."
