        "source_1": "I bought these to make cedar-and-lavender sachets for two closets and a storage trunk. Filling was easy, and the cotton handled the oils from the botanicals without leaving greasy spots. The drawstring needed a double knot or a tiny rubber band to keep the top from creeping open, but once tied, the bags stayed put on the hanger rod. Two weeks in, the shelves smelled fresh and I didn’t find cedar dust on the floor. The seams looked tidy after a few squeezes and re-fills, with no threads pulling out.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the closure: the cord slides back through the channel as soon as you jostle the bag. I measured the casing at roughly 6 mm with a 2–3 mm cord, and that slack lets it loosen during shaking. After a “tug test” the mouth opened about a centimeter, which is enough for cedar shavings to spill. I ended up replacing the string with a thicker shoelace and a cord lock; with the stock cord, you have to knot it every single time.",
        "source_3": "My concern is the fabric weave. The muslin is airy enough that fine lavender buds and cedar dust escaped and left specks on the shelf under each sachet. I lined a few bags with trimmed coffee filters, which solved it but added an extra step. The drawstring actually held fine for me once double-knotted; it was the pores in the cloth that let particles through when I squeezed or moved the sachets.",
        "source_4": "As an overall buy for household sachets, the batch felt inconsistent. Out of 40, about eight had short drawstrings that barely cinched, and three had crooked seams that opened up along the edge when filled halfway. I spent a Saturday sorting the good from the questionable ones and resewing a couple by hand. They did the job once I cherry-picked, but the variability across the pack made prep more of a project than I’d planned.",
        "source_5": "I used them strictly for long-term closet use and watched how they held up over a month. The cotton breathes enough for the cedar scent to circulate without the herbs drying into brittle dust. After refilling twice, the stitching at the top edge stayed flat and didn’t fray, and hanging them by the drawstring loop didn’t stretch the casing. I still tie a small overhand knot after cinching, but I haven’t had to add clips or safety pins.",
        "source_6": "I also tried a few as spice sachets for mulled cider and pot roast. The bags handled a gentle simmer for about 30 minutes without the seams letting go, and there was no dye bleed into the liquid. However, the cord loosened in the pot unless I knotted it tightly; one time the mouth opened and peppercorns escaped into the broth. Swapping in a thicker kitchen twine fixed it, but out of the package the closure isn’t secure for wet cooking."
