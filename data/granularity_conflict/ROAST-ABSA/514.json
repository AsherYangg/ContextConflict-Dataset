        "source_1": "I came in expecting a tight structure, but the modules felt shuffled. Week 3 rehashes material from Week 1, while Week 4 introduces new terms without laying groundwork. I kept pausing to search outside resources because key ideas weren’t defined when they first appeared. The instructor often veers into personal stories about her family; charming in small doses, but during graded quizzes I wasn’t sure what concepts were actually required. Assignments have multi-part directions spread across different pages, and I missed a subtask until someone flagged it in the forum.",
        "source_2": "I rely on Korean captions to study during my commute, so I focused almost entirely on the subtitles. In Lecture 6, “eigenvector” is rendered as “고유치” instead of “고유벡터,” and the caption lags by two to three seconds, so the math moves on before the line appears. Long sentences are translated word-for-word, which reads awkwardly and makes it hard to track the argument. Weekly recaps seem cleaner, but the midterm review has entire lines missing, and I had to rewind multiple times to piece together what was said.",
        "source_3": "From the first lecture, the roadmap made sense: objectives at the start, worked examples in the middle, a concise recap at the end. Each week builds on the previous one, and I never felt adrift. The instructor’s energy keeps long videos lively, especially in the optimization segment where she ties abstract ideas to household budgeting. The course page is tidy, with readings, practice quizzes, and deadlines all in predictable places. I finished a bit ahead of schedule and could apply the methods directly at work.",
        "source_4": "My focus is on how accessible the material is to newcomers. In Week 2, “convex hull” pops up before any formal definition, and the proof in Lecture 2.4 leans on set notation that isn’t introduced until later. The worksheet asks to “derive the KKT conditions,” but the preceding video only offers a two-minute overview and no step-by-step. I spent extra evenings watching external explainers to bridge gaps the course left open.",
        "source_5": "I zeroed in on the instructor’s presence. Even when the slides get dense, her eyes light up describing how the model predicted outcomes in her own family research, and that enthusiasm made the sessions feel more like a conversation than a monologue. She replies to forum threads within a day with detailed pointers, and the guest Q&A shows how deeply she cares about the topic. That contagious excitement kept me engaged through the longer modules."
