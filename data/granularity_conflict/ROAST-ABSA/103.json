        "source_1": "I booked La Res for our second night and ended up going back again because the food stood out from everything else we tried. The octopus starter was tender with a smoky char, and the ribeye came out exactly medium-rare with a crust you could hear when the knife went through it. They paired the steak with a plantain mash and a garlicky chimichurri that I kept spooning onto everything. Dessert was a coconut flan with toasted coconut on top and a bitter espresso that balanced the sweetness. If you care mainly about what’s on the plate, this spot delivers.",
        "source_2": "My experience revolved around dealing with staff, and it was rough from the first hour. We waited in line at check-in for 25 minutes and when it was finally our turn, the clerk didn’t make eye contact, slid the wristbands across the counter, and started talking to a colleague while we were asking about our room location. I requested extra towels at 5 pm; after two calls and a stop by the front desk, they showed up close to 8. At the pool bar, the bartender kept joking with another staffer while three of us were standing there with empty cups, and when I asked if they had bottled water, he sighed and pointed without a word. It felt like every small request turned into a chore.",
        "source_3": "Our Memorial Day girls’ getaway turned out exactly how we hoped: blue skies all weekend, long walks on a clean beach, and plenty of space to spread out by the pool. The room had high ceilings and a balcony that caught the breeze in the late afternoon, so we spent a lot of time out there before dinner. We tried a different restaurant each night and never ran out of choices, from seafood to a steakhouse and a casual spot with fresh fruit every morning. The grounds were easy to navigate, and we could get from our building to the beach path in under five minutes. For a quick holiday escape, the whole setup worked really well for us.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about room layout, so I’ll focus on that: our double had two queen beds with real walking space on both sides, a long bench for suitcases, and a closet deep enough to keep five people’s bags off the floor. The bathroom had a wide counter with two sinks, and the walk-in shower didn’t flood the rest of the floor because the glass partition actually sealed well. Outlets were next to both beds and the desk, so we could charge phones and a camera without unplugging lamps. The balcony faced the gardens, and even with all of us getting ready at the same time, we never felt cramped. If you travel with a group, the layout makes morning and evening routines painless.",
        "source_5": "We chose this property for a friends’ trip, and the place itself looked the part—open lobby, palm-lined paths, and a dining scene anchored by La Res, where our meal was the highlight. But the day-to-day interactions wore us down: no towels at the pool until after lunch, unanswered calls to housekeeping, and a server who walked away mid-sentence when we asked about an ingredient. The concierge waved us off about reservations and told us to “just show up,” which didn’t work when we tried to eat at peak time. By the second night we stopped asking for help and just figured things out ourselves. The setting and food checked the boxes, yet the way requests were handled colored the whole stay."
