        "source_1": "I went specifically for the hotel’s Italian restaurant and paid close attention to the bill. The server pointed out a nightly special—house-made pappardelle with short rib ragu bundled with a glass of Chianti for $29. My partner ordered a margherita pizza ($16), and we split an arugula salad ($11). With tax, the total was $82 for two, and the portions were big enough that we boxed half the pizza. For a downtown hotel, that came out lower than what I usually see, and there were no sneaky add-ons (sparkling water was optional; tap water was offered without charge).",
        "source_2": "We booked the revolving restaurant for 8:00 p.m. and got seated at 8:10, which was fine, but then it took 18 minutes for anyone to greet us. Drinks arrived another 12 minutes after that. Water glasses sat empty long enough that we asked twice, and empty plates lingered while we tried to catch a server’s eye. The manager eventually comped a dessert after we mentioned the delays. The slow rotation and city lights were fun, but the pacing of the meal felt off from start to finish.",
        "source_3": "Weekend stay overall: check-in at 4 p.m. was quick, and we were given a corner king on the 21st floor with big windows facing the river and skyline. The bed felt supportive, the room had plenty of space to open two suitcases, and the shower had solid pressure. Room service breakfast came in 25 minutes, still hot. What surprised me was the lobby—there were clusters of armchairs and a long sofa near the fireplace, and we always found seats to read and people-watch in the mornings. Elevators moved quickly even at checkout time. I’d pick this property again for another short getaway.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing just on the room comfort from my business trip. My first room on the 8th floor had a king mattress with a noticeable dip on the left side and pillows that flattened immediately. The in-room AC clicked and hummed every few minutes, which made it hard to settle. The layout felt tight enough that I had to edge sideways to get to the window. I asked to switch; the second room was quieter, but the bedding still didn’t give much support, and I woke up with a stiff neck both mornings.",
        "source_5": "Dinner pricing at the revolving restaurant added up fast. Two cocktails were $17 each, a crab cake starter was $22, ribeye $54, scallops $42, and a shared chocolate mousse $14. We chose a mid-range pinot for $68 and coffees at $6 each, and the check landed at $239 before tip. Portions were modest rather than shareable, and valet parking wasn’t validated, so we tacked on another $28. It’s a memorable setting, but the numbers climbed quicker than expected.",
        "source_6": "I booked hoping for the well-known views and asked for a higher floor, but ended up on 10 facing directly into an office building. If I leaned against the glass, I could see a sliver of river, otherwise it was mostly cubicles and conference rooms. At night the opposite tower’s lights reflected into our room, so we kept the shades closed. For our stay at least, the scenery didn’t live up to the postcard photos."
