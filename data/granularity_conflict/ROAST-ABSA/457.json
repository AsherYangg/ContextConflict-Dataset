        "source_1": "I buy Kettle’s Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper chips for the flavor alone. When I open the bag, you can actually see the pepper flecks and the slices still smell like cooked potato instead of mystery seasoning. The first bite has that clean salt snap, then the pepper warms up without tasting perfumey, and the potato flavor doesn’t get buried under sugar or smoke. Even the crunch feels “real”—thick cut, blistered edges, and no weird sweet aftertaste.",
        "source_2": "I’m laser‑focused on the reduced‑fat line, and the flavor choices feel thin. At my grocery store the shelf usually has Sea Salt, maybe Barbecue, and occasionally Sea Salt & Vinegar in the lighter version. I’m trying to stick with the 40% reduced‑fat bags, but I keep rotating the same couple of options week after week. I checked their website and local stores and still can’t find the dill, pepper, or any of the bolder blends in the lighter recipe.",
        "source_3": "Big‑picture take: these disappear fast in my house. I set out a 13‑ounce bag during a movie night and by the time the credits rolled, only crumbs were left. The chips hold up in tuna melts and grilled cheese without turning soggy, and the seasoning plays nice with salsa or plain. I’ve started keeping a spare bag in the pantry because I tend to work through a “just one more handful” cycle until it’s gone.",
        "source_4": "Flavor focus here: the seasoning doesn’t land right for me. The pepper tastes dusty, like pre‑ground stuff that sat too long, and there’s a faint metallic note that lingers after a few chips. The oil coats my tongue so the potato starts to feel muted, and a couple of chips in, I get a bitter edge from the darker bubbles on the slices. I expected a simple salt‑and‑pepper profile, but it comes off muddled.",
        "source_5": "On variety, I’m swimming in choices where I shop. My local co‑op and the big box store both rotate a dozen Kettle flavors—Jalapeño, Pepperoncini, New York Cheddar, Backyard Barbeque, Dill Pickle, and seasonal runs like Truffle or Maple Bacon. I’ve even ordered a mixed case online that included six different flavors in one shipment. Between the regular and “sharing size” bags, I rarely repeat the same flavor two weeks in a row.",
        "source_6": "Overall impression from a snacking standpoint: I don’t tear through these. After a handful, the salt piles up and I reach for water, and the oiliness leaves a film that slows me down. I opened a family‑size bag for a weekend barbecue, and half of it went back into a clip because people nibbled, then moved on to the fruit tray. The crunch is loud, but I don’t find myself circling back to the bowl over and over."
