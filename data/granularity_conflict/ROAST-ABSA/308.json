        "source_1": "I’m focusing on battery only: with two SIMs active, VoLTE on, and about 2 hours of YouTube plus an hour of maps, I’m consistently getting around 6.5–7 hours of screen-on time. Overnight idle drain is 2–3%. Using the in-box 33W charger, it goes from 12% to 88% in roughly 45 minutes, and the back of the phone sits around 37–38°C while charging. Haven’t tested the camera or speakers enough to comment on those.",
        "source_2": "My overall take after two weeks: the phone restarts by itself about once every other day, usually when I’m switching between a call and WhatsApp. The lower part of the screen sometimes registers ghost touches, which makes typing a chore. PUBG runs but stutters during smoke effects, and the area near the camera bump gets toasty after 15–20 minutes of GPS navigation. I contacted Flipkart chat twice; they made me run the self-diagnostic in the app and asked for videos. After submitting, the return request was closed with a note saying “issue not replicated.” The local service center asked me to leave the device for observation for 3–5 days, which wasn’t practical since this is my only phone.",
        "source_3": "I had the opposite experience on the platform side. Ordered from WS Retail via Flipkart, and it arrived a day early with the seal intact and a fresh IMEI activation slip. I needed the invoice corrected for reimbursement at work; support on the Flipkart app picked up within 2 minutes and reissued the bill with the updated GST details the same evening. They also helped me trigger the Jio eSIM transfer by walking me through the QR flow on a call. No issues with the seller or delivery.",
        "source_4": "Camera-only impressions: daylight shots come out crisp with accurate skin tones, and HDR handles bright skies without blowing out the clouds. Indoors under tube lights, the focusing hunts a bit and faces look soft unless I tap to focus. The ultrawide shows visible edge distortion and more noise. In 4K, stabilization crops heavily and still shows a wobble while walking. Night mode can pull in detail if I keep a steady hand for 2–3 seconds; otherwise, moving subjects smear. The front camera smooths textures even with “beauty” turned off.",
        "source_5": "As an overall daily-use device, it’s been reliable for me. Apps open quickly, switching between Chrome, YouTube, Maps, and Gmail is smooth, and RAM management keeps 7–8 apps in memory. Calls over VoWiFi are clear, and 5G on Airtel averages 250–300 Mbps in my area. The single bottom speaker is easy to cover when gaming, and haptics feel faint while typing. Packaging from Flipkart was clean, and activation was straightforward. For commuting, music streaming, and work calls, it’s doing the job without fuss.",
        "source_6": "Narrow focus on software and updates: out of the box I got an OTA within 48 hours (about 410 MB) that moved the security patch to September and improved touch response—scrolling jitter in Twitter is gone. A second patch later added a toggle to disable lockscreen ads; there are still a few preinstalled apps, but most can be uninstalled or disabled. I haven’t noticed any app crashes since the first patch, and the phone now boots in around 23 seconds compared to roughly 30 seconds before. I can’t comment on hardware durability yet."
