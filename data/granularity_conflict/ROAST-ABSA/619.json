        "source_1": "I focused on the bill this trip: two nights booked through the Marriott app at 48,000 JPY per night, and the service charge plus taxes pushed the total just over 110,000 JPY. Breakfast was quoted at around 4,500 JPY per person at check‑in, and a small beer from the minibar came to about 1,200 JPY on the folio. Laundry for a single shirt wasn’t cheap either. Nothing was out of line for a big-brand property in Tokyo, but the add-ons stacked up quickly compared with what I’ve paid around Ebisu and Meguro.",
        "source_2": "I stayed specifically to enjoy the room’s look, and it hit the mark for me. The king room had a classic European vibe—velvet drapes that reached the floor, a gilded mirror over a writing desk, patterned carpet, and a deep green marble vanity in the bathroom. The brass lamp switches and tufted headboard felt intentionally old‑world rather than minimalist. Paired with the Heavenly Bed linens and a small crystal light fixture, it felt like a city manor house rather than a modern box.",
        "source_3": "I only went for breakfast and it was worth setting an alarm. I grabbed a table at The Terrace right at 7:00 a.m.; the staff had the omelet station running, and there were trays of flaky croissants alongside grilled fish, tamago, and miso soup. Coffee was refilled without me flagging anyone down, and the fruit didn’t feel like an afterthought—ripe melon and citrus, not just the usual apple slices. Sitting by the window looking toward Yebisu Garden Place made for a relaxed start before meetings.",
        "source_4": "Four nights on a business trip gave me a good sense of the overall rhythm. The lobby is all marble and chandeliers, so arriving felt like stepping into a classic European salon. Check‑in at 3 p.m. moved fast, luggage was in my room by the time I got upstairs, and housekeeping left extra water each afternoon without me asking. I liked being able to walk through the covered passage to Ebisu Station, and my room on a high floor framed Tokyo Tower at night. From front desk to bell staff, interactions were smooth and unforced.",
        "source_5": "My take on the hotel as a whole is less rosy after a weekend stay. The uphill walk from JR Ebisu with a suitcase wasn’t fun in the rain, and the room I was given had scuffed edges on the desk and a shower temperature that wavered mid‑rinse. I could hear the elevator chime late at night from my doorway. Checkout had a line that took about 20 minutes, and by the time breakfast and taxes were tallied, my total outpaced what I’ve paid at smaller places in Shibuya with fresher-looking furniture."
