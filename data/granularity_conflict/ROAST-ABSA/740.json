        "source_1": "I picked this up for around Rs 10,000 after the listing said “dual SIM,” but the tray is the hybrid type. I’d skipped other models because of that exact limitation, so this stung. Worse, streaming is a chore: YouTube or Hotstar will play for a bit and then freeze solid. Sitting practically under a cell tower in my neighborhood didn’t help; the player just hangs and only resumes if I leave the phone alone for a few minutes. Tried both Airtel and Jio, changed APNs, reset network settings—same story. When I tried to exchange it, the model didn’t show up in the partner portal and the IMEI kept failing verification, so I couldn’t even return it.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery: with 4G on all day, two email accounts syncing, an hour of voice calls, Telegram, and about 90 minutes of Spotify, I consistently end my day with roughly 25–30% left. Screen-on time hovers around 6 hours for me. I top up with the bundled 10W charger from about 15% to full in under two hours. No heat spikes during Maps navigation or a 30-minute gaming session (Alto’s Odyssey), and standby drain overnight is around 2–3%.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on connectivity: in Pune (Kothrud), using Jio 4G, I’m getting 25–35 Mbps on Speedtest at home and around 15 Mbps on my office floor. I watched a 45-minute 1080p YouTube tech review and an IPL stream on Hotstar during the commute without buffering. VoLTE calls sound clear, even in the basement parking where my old phone used to drop. I also ran a 40-minute Zoom call on laptop via hotspot; no disconnects, ping stayed under 70 ms most of the time. Wi‑Fi on my 2.4 GHz router has been steady as well.",
        "source_4": "Camera-only impressions: daylight shots are fine for quick social posts, but indoor photos get mushy fast. The autofocus occasionally hunts, especially on close-ups of documents; I’ve had to tap to focus multiple times. Shutter lag is noticeable, so moving subjects—my toddler running—often blur. Video at 1080p lacks stabilization, and walking footage jitters. The front camera softens skin to the point where beard hair looks smudged. Tried a third-party camera app and HDR helps a little in bright scenes, but low light remains grainy with blotchy shadows.",
        "source_5": "SIM tray note only: the product page made me think this was true dual SIM, but it’s the hybrid arrangement—either two SIMs or one SIM plus microSD. I carry personal and work numbers and also need a memory card for offline files. I ended up removing the card and now micro-manage storage every week. If you must run two lines and keep expandable storage at the same time, this tray design forces a compromise that wasn’t obvious from the headline description.",
        "source_6": "After two weeks as my main phone, it’s been reliable for calls, UPI, WhatsApp, and banking apps. Network stays stable on Airtel in Bengaluru; podcasts and a couple of 30–40 minute YouTube videos during my metro rides play through fine. The screen is bright enough indoors, and outdoors I bump it to max and get by. Daylight photos are decent for family albums; low light needs a steady hand. Battery lasts my workday without a mid-day charge. The hybrid SIM tray is there, but I use one SIM with a 64 GB card so it’s not an issue for me. For the price I paid, it handles the basics without fuss."
