        "source_1": "I watched the Week 1–3 lectures on Coursera using a MacBook with wired headphones. The audio jumps from barely audible to booming between segments, and Lecture 2.4 has a faint hiss under the voice. At 720p the slide text looks soft, so equations and small labels are hard to read unless I pause and zoom in. The captions run about two seconds behind in several videos, which makes following along tricky.",
        "source_2": "I finished the course in a single calendar month, spacing the modules across evenings after work. The sequence of short lectures into quizzes and then a hands-on lab in a hosted notebook felt well thought out, and the autograder caught edge cases I wouldn’t have considered. The forum stickies pointed me to common pitfalls, and the instructor chimed in on my thread within a day. I wrapped up the final project and replicated the workflow on a small dataset at my job the next week.",
        "source_3": "I joined the live office hour in Week 1 (Tuesday 6 p.m. UTC) and again in Week 2; both times the Zoom link in the Announcements worked and the instructor took questions for almost an hour. We even did a quick breakout exercise with a TA screen-sharing a solution. By Week 5 the synchronous sessions had tapered off and forum activity slowed, so most of the real-time back-and-forth actually happened early on.",
        "source_4": "I’m only commenting on the videos: the 1080p streams look sharp on a 24-inch monitor, and the slide fonts are large enough that I never had to squint. Diagrams are drawn live with a tablet, and each step is animated so you can see how a formula is built. The audio is even across lectures without mic pops, and the chapter markers make it easy to jump back to the proof in 3.3.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled in the May session and stuck with it through Week 4 before bailing. The syllabus shifted mid-run, replacing a planned case study with an external reading behind a journal paywall. Two peer-graded assignments landed 36 hours apart, both due at 23:59 Pacific, and the feedback I received was a single sentence with no reference to the rubric. Between the bunched deadlines and inconsistent materials, I couldn’t justify pushing to the final."
