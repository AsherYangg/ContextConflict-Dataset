        "source_1": "I booked the Spaulding Hotel for a theater weekend with my teenager, and the location worked well for us—walked to the Curran in under 15 minutes and ducked into H&M, Urban Outfitters, and Forever 21 between matinee and dinner. Our sixth-floor room overlooked the neighboring property’s pool; nights were calm enough for us to wind down, and the hardwood floors and compact layout made the space feel tidy and snug. The second-floor lounge had laundry machines, so we tossed in a load before our flight, grabbed tea from the lobby, and packed fresh clothes in the morning. I’d pick this place again for downtown visits.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on noise only: my room on the sixth floor sat near the elevator and faced the adjacent pool area. Around 6:30 a.m., I could hear maintenance blowers, and in the evening there were splashes and chatter that slipped through the window seals. The soft whir from the elevator shaft was noticeable at night, so I ended up using a white-noise app and earplugs. If sound matters to you, ask for a room at the opposite end of the corridor and away from the pool side.",
        "source_3": "I chose the Spaulding because I needed on-site laundry mid-trip, and I used only that amenity. On Tuesday, two washers had hand-written “out of order” notes, and one dryer kept stopping after a few minutes with a cool drum. My jeans came out damp even after three cycles. The detergent vending machine was empty, and there was no change machine in the lounge; I had to run down to the front desk for quarters. The space itself was handy, but the machines could use better upkeep and signage.",
        "source_4": "Four-night stay with my daughter: the central spot made it easy to catch a show and browse the big-box boutiques, but the room itself felt worn. The hardwood had scuffs, the window let in a draft, and the blanket was thin for the chilly evenings. I noticed dust along the baseboards, and one day housekeeping never reached our floor; we had to request fresh towels at 8 p.m. Street sounds filtered up more than expected, and a faint chlorine smell from the neighboring pool sometimes drifted in through the bathroom vent.",
        "source_5": "I’m rating this strictly on location: from the front door, it took me about 10–12 minutes to walk to the Orpheum and the Warfield, five minutes to H&M and Urban Outfitters, and there were multiple bus lines within a block. I never bothered with rideshares, and being able to step out for late-night snacks and be back in the room in under five minutes was the main win for me.",
        "source_6": "I only care about cleanliness, and the sixth-floor room I had passed my checks: no dust behind the nightstand, fresh-smelling linens, spotless bathroom grout, and a newly mopped shine on the hardwood. Housekeeping swapped towels and emptied the trash each morning before 11, and I didn’t find any stray hairs in the shower or on the pillows."
