        "source_1": "I’m focusing solely on the video presentation. I watched the lessons on a 13-inch laptop with headphones, and the host’s light-hearted delivery made the sessions feel informal, but the production choices were uneven. The volume jumped between segments, so I’d turn up the intro and then get blasted when the slides cut in. On several lessons the background music sat right under the narration and competed with the explanation of terms, especially when the instructor shifted to examples. The edits lingered on reaction shots and jokes for beats that slowed the flow, while key definitions flashed by in a lower-third graphic too quickly to copy. The visuals—close-ups of annotated lines and color-coded meters—were genuinely helpful when they appeared, but they were sporadic, so I kept pausing to catch a frame instead of listening straight through.",
        "source_2": "Speaking to the course as a whole: I came in without much exposure to poems beyond what I skimmed in school, and by the end I had a way to read them with more intention. The instructor introduced a simple checklist—tone, imagery, sound, and structure—and I’ve started using it when I read work by friends in a local writing group. I’m not drafting my own pieces right now, but I can point to where a stanza drifts or why a metaphor lands, and that’s new for me. I watched a lesson or two each evening after dinner, and the jokes kept me engaged enough to stick through to the final module. Finishing the sequence felt like turning on a light in a room I hadn’t walked through before.",
        "source_3": "Narrowly about captions and terminology: I rely on captions because I sometimes watch on the train, and the auto-generated text struggled with poetry jargon. “Assonance” repeatedly showed up as “as a nun’s,” and “caesura” was rendered three different ways in one lesson, which muddled the definitions while the instructor was contrasting them. In the “Meter and Mood” module, the captions lagged by a couple seconds, so the highlighted syllables didn’t sync with the spoken pattern. I ended up rewinding to match the sound to the visual, and keeping a separate tab open to check spelling of terms because the transcript had inconsistencies.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression of the course: I expected more guided practice, but the modules lean toward appreciation rather than building a writing habit. The quizzes were multiple choice on definitions and recognition, and the assignments were optional prompts without examples of how to revise. I submitted a draft to the peer review and got two one-sentence comments that didn’t address structure or imagery, and there wasn’t any instructor feedback channel. The tone of the videos is cheerful, which made the time pass, yet I closed the course still unsure how to take a rough stanza and shape it step by step. It’s fine for people who want to understand what they’re reading; I needed a scaffold for producing work.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on how examples were used in the video lessons: when the instructor broke down a sonnet, the overlay highlighted the turn in line 9 and traced the rhyme scheme with different colors, and seeing that mapped out clicked something for me. There was a segment where two drafts of a short poem were shown side by side; the narrator read them aloud and pointed to where enjambment changed the energy, and that demonstration felt like watching a coach draw routes on a play. The selections ranged from a Mary Oliver piece to a contemporary spoken-word clip, and the contrasts helped me see how the same principle shows up across styles. I started pausing to try the checklist on my own, and those concrete walkthroughs were the moments that stuck."
