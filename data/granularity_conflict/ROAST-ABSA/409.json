        "source_1": "I worked this cereal into my morning routine over the last month. I measure out about 3/4 cup, add oat milk and a handful of blueberries, and it carries me through to lunch without a snack. The label reads clean and the taste is simple, so it plays well with fruit or a spoon of peanut butter. The pieces stay firm for a few minutes before softening, and the last spoonful turns a bit porridge-like, which I don’t mind. The carton seals well enough that the crunch doesn’t fade during the week.",
        "source_2": "I’m strict about ingredients, so I flipped the box over before buying. It lists whole grains, a bit of salt, and a touch of molasses, and I didn’t see BHT, BHA, dyes like Red 40, or anything labeled “artificial flavor.” That short list is exactly what I look for—no mystery syrup, no colorants, and nothing unpronounceable. This checks my “five ingredients or fewer” rule.",
        "source_3": "I tried a bowl every day for a week and couldn’t get used to it. Even after sitting in milk while I brewed coffee, some of the bigger flakes stayed tough, and my jaw felt worked by the time I was halfway through. The flavor stayed pretty flat for me; bananas and cinnamon didn’t change that much. I ended up mixing it with another cereal just to finish the box.",
        "source_4": "I bought it because the front says there are no preservatives, but the ingredient panel mentions mixed tocopherols “to preserve freshness.” That’s still a preservative in my book. Mine also lists annatto for color, which isn’t synthetic, but it is an added color. If you’re trying to avoid any additives at all, those two lines are worth noting.",
        "source_5": "I usually go for very dense, grain-forward cereals, and this one fits that niche. The texture is coarse in a good way—thick flakes with a bit of grit that hold up for 5–7 minutes in milk. I like it best with plain yogurt and chopped apples; it brings out a toasty aroma without added flavorings. I don’t add sweetener because the molasses already nudges it in that direction."
