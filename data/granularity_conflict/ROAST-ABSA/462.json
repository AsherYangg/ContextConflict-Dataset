        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the in‑video quizzes, and they actually kept me engaged. Each segment pauses for 3–5 short questions with instant hints, and the explanations pop up right next to the timeline so I can jump back to the exact moment I missed. In Module 2, a couple of “definition vs. example” items exposed gaps I didn’t realize I had, and the image overlays on the answer choices were a nice touch. They do add minutes to each lesson, but I liked the enforced checkpoints because they stopped me from passively letting the video roll while I zoned out.",
        "source_2": "I couldn’t get past the presenter’s delivery. Every sentence had exaggerated stresses, like a metronome hitting random words, and the pauses felt staged rather than natural. I ended up switching to 1.25x just to smooth out the cadence, and even then I kept scrubbing back because the rhythm made it hard to track the point of each example. By the third lecture I was reading the transcript instead of listening, which defeated the whole point of the video format.",
        "source_3": "As someone coming in cold, I found the course a solid on‑ramp. The first week lays out a simple mental map and keeps jargon to a minimum, with short recaps after each concept so I never felt lost. The spreadsheet mini‑project at the end of Week 1 let me practice without installing anything, and the glossary cards helped me follow discussions at work. It’s not designed to turn you into an expert, but it gave me the vocabulary and confidence to dive into deeper material; I’ve already shared the link with two teammates who needed a starting point.",
        "source_4": "I went in excited but tapped out midway. The videos keep stopping for tiny quizzes that rehash the previous slide, and several “activities” kick you to an external site that wants another login and doesn’t match the screenshots. One exercise asked for a dataset that wasn’t linked anymore, so I wasted time hunting it down. Between the constant interruptions and the very high‑level coverage, I closed out after Week 2 and looked elsewhere.",
        "source_5": "The production polish stood out to me. The audio is clean and consistent across lectures, the screen captures are sharp, and the slides use clear color‑coding so you can track definitions, examples, and warnings at a glance. I liked the occasional lightboard segments with subtle overlays highlighting the term being discussed, and the downloadable PDFs mirror the on‑screen flow. It’s obvious a lot of care went into filming and post‑production.",
        "source_6": "The workload around the quizzes felt out of proportion. Progress is gated, so a 12‑minute lesson turns into 25 because you have to click through several micro‑questions and read the explanations before the Next button lights up. If you jump back in the timeline, the quiz sometimes resets, and on two occasions (Week 3, Lecture 4) I had to repeat a set because the page timed out. By the end of that module I was spending more time navigating the checkpoints than absorbing the material."
