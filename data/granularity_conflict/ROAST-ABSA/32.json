        "source_1": "Picked up the K50i during a sale for under 25k and it’s been a dependable daily driver. The 144Hz setting is on all the time because it makes scrolling through Gmail, Reddit, and maps feel snappy, and the phone doesn’t choke when I’ve got Spotify, Chrome with a bunch of tabs, and Sheets open together. Daylight photos look fine for Facebook and WhatsApp; low light is usable but not something I’d print. I commute between Noida and Gurgaon, and the 5G signal on Airtel stays locked almost the whole way. Battery gets me from 8 a.m. to dinner with cautious use, and the 40-minute top-up from around 15% to the mid-80s has saved me more than once.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the display: the 144Hz refresh makes the interface feel fluid in every app I use, but coming from an AMOLED phone, the IPS LCD on the K50i doesn’t show the same deep blacks or saturated colors. Watching dark scenes on Netflix looks a bit grayish, and outdoors at noon in Delhi I have to push brightness near max to read small text. I leave the screen at 120/144Hz because it feels better, but I can see the battery dipping faster than I expected compared to my old AMOLED device.",
        "source_3": "Battery-only thoughts: I average about 5 to 5.5 hours of screen-on time with mixed use (YouTube, two hours of calls, Telegram, and some Google Maps). On busy days, it dips to the 20% range by late afternoon, so I keep the charger in my bag. The nice part is the charging speed—plugging in at around 15% while I make dinner takes it to roughly 85% in about 40 minutes with the bundled adapter. Overnight drains are minimal with data on, so standby is fine; it’s the active usage where it doesn’t stretch as long as I hoped.",
        "source_4": "On performance only: compared to my partner’s Snapdragon 870 phone, single-threaded stuff like opening heavy apps (Instagram, camera on first launch after a while, or switching to a big Excel file) takes a beat longer on the K50i. Once I’m inside the app though, it holds up well—exporting a short 1080p clip from CapCut and decompressing large ZIP files happen quickly, and games like CODM run smoothly on balanced settings for long sessions. Multitasking between maps, music, and ride-hailing doesn’t cause unexpected reloads.",
        "source_5": "Strictly about connectivity: I travel Mumbai–Pune and occasionally to Ahmedabad for work, using dual-SIM (Jio primary, Vodafone Idea secondary). The K50i consistently latches onto 5G where available, and I’ve seen speed tests between 200–350 Mbps in Bandra and Hinjewadi, with decent indoor coverage in hotels. Handoffs between cells during train rides are stable, calls stay clear, and hotspot to my laptop doesn’t choke even when I’m uploading a bunch of photos.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after two weeks: the phone runs smooth thanks to the high refresh rate and it charges fast, but a few things keep bothering me. The screen doesn’t have the punch or efficiency I’m used to, so I find myself managing brightness to keep the battery from slipping too fast. Photos are fine for casual sharing, yet night shots look flat. And while games and multitasking are strong, app launches and initial loads feel a touch sluggish compared with an 870 device I still use. If display quality and camera are top priority, I’d look elsewhere; if you value speed in multi-core tasks and quick top-ups, this one fits better."
