        "source_1": "I booked two nights at the Apex City of London Hotel while visiting offices near Fenchurch Street. Check-in at 2:10 pm took under five minutes; Priya at the desk offered bottled water and mapped out a walking route to the Sky Garden. My room on the 6th floor faced the courtyard, so I slept through both nights without street noise. The bed had two firm pillows and two softer ones, the shower had steady pressure, and housekeeping replaced the Nespresso pods unprompted. Tower Hill station was a five-minute walk even with a roller bag, and I could get to Westminster in about 12 minutes on the District line. Small touches like a rubber duck and plenty of USB sockets made the stay feel thought through.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on service. I rang reception at 10:45 pm to ask for two extra towels; no answer after six rings. Tried again at 10:58; still nothing. I went down in person at 11:05 and the night manager looked irritated, said housekeeping had “shut the cupboards,” and asked me to wait in the lobby. It took another 20 minutes before someone brought one towel. The next morning, I requested a late checkout at 8:30 am and was told to call back at 10, then at 11, which meant I couldn’t plan my day. I never got a clear answer until 11:40.",
        "source_3": "I stayed in room 415 and want to focus on the room itself. The air-conditioning rattled whenever it dipped below 20°C, and the wall thermostat lagged, so the room swung from chilly to stuffy. The blackout curtain didn’t reach the edges of the window, and the emergency exit light glowed into the room at night. I found fine dust along the headboard shelf and a loose tile by the bathroom threshold that clicked with each step. Water temperature in the shower pulsed every few minutes, going from warm to noticeably hot for a few seconds.",
        "source_4": "Everyone says it’s near the Tube, which is true on paper, but arriving on a Sunday caught me out. The Circle and District lines were partly closed for engineering, so from Heathrow I had to transfer twice and then walk from Aldgate East with a suitcase because Tower Hill was exit-only. The sidewalks around Seething Lane were crowded with tour groups by midday, yet most nearby cafés shut by 3 pm, and after 8 pm the area felt deserted. With weekend closures, my trip to South Kensington took almost 40 minutes door to door.",
        "source_5": "I picked the hotel for a midweek work trip and ended up cutting my last morning short. Check-in at 4 pm was fine, but at 6:30 am the next day I was woken by drilling from the street side; double glazing reduced the hum but not the high-pitched whine. Housekeeping knocked twice before 9 even though the Do Not Disturb tag was on; the second time they opened the door a crack before backing out. One lift was out of service all afternoon, so returning from meetings meant waiting through three full cars. The room was functional, yet between the noise, early knocks, and elevator delays, I couldn’t get the focused mornings I needed.",
        "source_6": "I chose this place mainly for transit. From City Airport I took the DLR to Tower Gateway and walked four minutes with a carry-on—no stairs on the route, just one gentle ramp past Trinity Square. For a late show, I hopped on the District line from Tower Hill and was back in the room in under 15 minutes. Bus 15 stopped close by for a direct ride to St. Paul’s. The paths are well lit, and the hotel entrance sits off the main road, so pickup by rideshare was straightforward at 6 am."
