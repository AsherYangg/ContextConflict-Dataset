        "source_1": "I’m only reviewing the packaging on my Brussel’s bonsai. The tree came double-boxed with the nursery pot zip-tied to a cardboard collar, branches wrapped in breathable foam, and a bamboo stake keeping the trunk from shifting. A heat pack and paper fill kept the root ball snug, so there wasn’t a tablespoon of soil loose in the box when I opened it in Minneapolis in January.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on delivery time: I paid for the two-day option on my order placed April 3. The label was printed the 4th, the carrier didn’t scan it until the 6th, and the box didn’t reach my Portland porch until the 12th. I can’t speak to the plant yet; I’m only noting that the transit stretched well past what I selected at checkout.",
        "source_3": "This was my fourth tree from Brussel’s, and as a whole the purchase lined up with what I expected. The plant arrived with firm, glossy leaves, small buds tucked along the stems, and a care card that matched advice from my local nursery. After a week by a south window, tiny new shoots appeared, and the included ceramic pot and mesh screens made repotting easy. For what I paid during the spring sale, the size and vigor felt fair.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on how it was packed: my box had a fist-sized hole on one side and the pot was tilted 45 degrees when I opened it. The air pillows were deflated, the branch tie had snapped, and a lower twig was rubbed raw where it had bounced against the rim. I spent half an hour vacuuming soil out of the seams of the carton and picking bark flakes off the dining table.",
        "source_5": "Judging the overall experience, the plant looked nice out of the box but never set blossoms over the next two months, even with a grow light and weekly fertilizer. A handful of leaves browned at the tips, and I trimmed back a couple of leggy shoots to keep it presentable on the kitchen counter. Customer service suggested brighter light and cooler nights, so this may be one for patient growers rather than a gift with immediate wow-factor."
