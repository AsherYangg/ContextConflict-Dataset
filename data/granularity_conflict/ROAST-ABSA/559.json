        "source_1": "I picked this place purely for where it sits on the map, and it delivered. I walked four minutes to the convention center each morning, grabbed the Blue Line two blocks over for a meeting across town, and had a late-night pho spot open until 1 a.m. around the corner. There’s a small grocery on the ground floor for snacks and water, and the street lighting made the walk back feel straightforward even after midnight.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on cost because it caught me off guard. The nightly rate looked reasonable online, but at check-in they tacked on a $35 “urban amenities” fee plus taxes, parking was $28 per night, and a $75 hold sat on my card for five days after checkout. The weekday rate also jumped from $109 to $189 between my first and second night, and the breakfast voucher didn’t cover coffee, which added another few dollars each morning.",
        "source_3": "As a whole stay, this fell short for me. My room had a damp smell when I opened the door, the elevator stopped on random floors without anyone getting on, and housekeeping didn’t make it to my room one of the days despite the sign being out since 9 a.m. Street noise came through the windows until late, and the front desk line stretched to the lobby every evening, so even simple requests took a while. I checked out feeling like I spent most of my time troubleshooting little issues.",
        "source_4": "I booked thinking I could pop over to the waterfront, but it’s not a quick stroll—more like 25 minutes with a steep stretch near the end. The nearest subway station is closed for renovations, so rideshares became the default and surged most evenings. My room faced an active construction site; trucks started beeping at 6:30 a.m., and sirens seemed constant on the main avenue. If you’re counting on easy transit and quiet streets, this area might test your patience.",
        "source_5": "Looking at the trip overall, it worked well for a quick city break. Check-in was smooth even at 10 p.m., the room was tidy with a firm mattress and plenty of outlets, and the Wi‑Fi handled a couple of Zoom calls without hiccups. I liked having cafes and a bakery within a block, and the front desk extended a late checkout so I could squeeze in one more museum visit. For what I paid, the value lined up with what I needed: a simple base with convenient access to the places on my itinerary."
