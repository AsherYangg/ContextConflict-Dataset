    "content": {
        "source_1": "I came in with only jQuery experience, and by week 3 I could build a small catalog app with controllers, services, and routing. The lecture on the digest cycle finally made sense when Yaakov live-coded a watch example and showed how updates propagate. I kept pausing to implement the same snippets and the quizzes felt like a checkpoint rather than a hurdle. By the final module I could wire up $http calls and handle errors without copy-pasting from random blogs, which is a big change from how I used to learn front-end frameworks.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the platform reliability: the first two sessions kept freezing every 8–10 minutes, audio fell out of sync, and the player would “complete” a lecture I hadn’t finished. The course start was pushed back with an announcement posted the evening before, and the assignments page briefly showed 404 errors during the new release window. I tried Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, cleared caches, and even switched networks; the submit button for Assignment 2 didn’t render until the next day. I ended up downloading transcripts and watching mirrored videos because the site wouldn’t hold my place or accept uploads.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on example relevance: the lecture demos were toy apps—simple todo lists and one-level routes—while Assignment 2 demanded nested ui-router states, form validation, and $http promise chains we hadn’t covered. The filters lesson used static arrays, but the rubric asked for pagination and server-side data, so I spent hours piecing together answers from StackOverflow threads. The starter code included unfamiliar patterns like interceptor setup and resolve blocks with minimal explanation. When I finally passed the grader, it felt accidental because the examples hadn’t built the path to the required solution.",
        "source_4": "As a remote learner watching at 9 p.m. after work, I kept bumping into instructions meant for a physical classroom—“form groups,” “discuss with your table,” “compare whiteboard solutions”—which doesn’t translate to a solo setup. On the forum, staff replies were often “just search for it,” so threads turned into scavenger hunts rather than guided hints. The pacing assumes someone can ask a TA in the room, but in the MOOC, you wait days for a reply and lose momentum. I took Dr. Chuck’s Python course earlier, and the difference in scaffolding, checklists, and feedback cadence was noticeable; this felt like an on-campus syllabus uploaded without adaptation.",
        "source_5": "Zooming in on syntax explanations: the breakdown of $scope versus controllerAs was clear, with diagrams that showed how bindings travel and why “this” avoids collisions. The directives section finally clicked when the instructor mapped isolate scope attributes (@, =, &) to real props and demonstrated naming conventions across files. The quiz asked me to predict binding behavior in edge cases, and that exercise cemented the pattern. I went back to an old jQuery plugin and refactored it into a directive without guessing, which I hadn’t managed before.",
        "source_6": "Overall, I’m picking up Angular building blocks—components, filters, routing—and the instructor’s energy keeps the lectures moving, but the assignments often leap ahead of what’s demonstrated. Announcements about schedule changes have arrived late more than once, and I lost work when the player marked videos as completed after a browser refresh. I finished the capstone with a recipe app, though it required cross-referencing external docs to bridge gaps between demos and the rubric. If the examples aligned with the tasks and the site stayed steady during releases, the experience would match the momentum I feel during the lectures."
