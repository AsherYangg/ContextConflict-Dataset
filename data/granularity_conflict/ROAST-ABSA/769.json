        "source_1": "My shipment of the French Vanilla single-serve cups came in a plain brown box, but the bubble wrap inside the product box was layered thick—three sheets around the inner carton, plus extra padding on the corners. I could hear the cups rattling a bit when I picked it up, yet none of them were loose or sticky. Seals were intact, no damp spots, and the outer packing box was completely dry. For me the bubble wrap did the job; I even kept the wrap to reuse because it was still intact.",
        "source_2": "My order arrived with the outer packing box damp to the touch and a sweet vanilla smell coming through the tape. When I opened it, the product box had a strip of bubble wrap that looked popped in the middle, and several cups were stuck to the side panel with syrupy residue. The cardboard felt soft around the corners. I had to peel the cups off slowly to avoid tearing the labels, and a couple of seams looked compromised. I didn’t even try brewing those because the contents had obviously escaped from somewhere inside.",
        "source_3": "I’ve bought this manufacturer’s French Vanilla cups at Costco in the retail dispenser package—the one with a perforated front where you pull out a cup—and that setup is sturdy. My Amazon delivery came in a plain box without the retail dispenser, but everything inside was orderly: cups in two rows, no sticky patches, and the perforated spout on the inner carton was intact. Flavor is consistent with what I get from Costco, and the box fits fine on my pantry shelf. I’d buy from either source based on this experience.",
        "source_4": "I contacted chat support because the inner carton was a mess, and the agent assured me a refund would be processed within 3–5 business days. Two hours later, an email landed saying a replacement had been created instead, shipping overnight. I replied asking to cancel the replacement and stick with the refund, but the tracking link went live anyway. I ended up receiving a second box while still waiting for the original charge to settle, which made returns and billing more confusing than it needed to be.",
        "source_5": "I’ve ordered these French Vanilla cups three times from Amazon. The first shipment was in a plain box with minimal padding and a couple of dented cups in the mix. The second and third had an inner sleeve with bubble wrap tucked on both sides and cardboard dividers separating rows, and those arrived clean and dry. The retail dispenser package from Costco is more presentable on a counter, but the Amazon cartons stack better in a cabinet. Between the two, I care more about how they ship and store than how they look on the shelf.",
        "source_6": "The carrier left the package on my porch in the afternoon sun, and the outer box had faint stains along the bottom edge. Inside, the product box had a broken seam and the bubble wrap was bunched on one side instead of covering the top, so whatever ruptured ended up coating a row of cups. The vanilla smell was strong and the lids were tacky; a few cups were literally glued to the interior wall. I had to rinse off each one, and even after wiping the box, my hands stayed sticky."
