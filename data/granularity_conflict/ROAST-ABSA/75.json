        "source_1": "I booked the Palomar because I had sessions at Moscone and the map showed it “a few blocks” away. Technically true, but the walk from my room on 4th Street took 18–20 minutes each morning due to construction detours and heavy foot traffic on Market. At night, sirens and late-night street noise filtered through even on the 10th floor, and I ended up buying earplugs at the Walgreens around the corner. It’s central, sure, but if you’re hauling a poster tube and laptop bag, that “easy walk” felt longer than advertised.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on service only: I arrived at 3:30 p.m. to a lobby line snaking past the elevators and waited about 25 minutes to reach the desk. My room wasn’t ready, so they took my number; the promised text came almost two hours later while I was already at a breakout session. Housekeeping missed the extra-towels request I put in through the app, and turndown never happened even after I called at 7 p.m. On the flip side, the bell staff pulled a cab for me to SFO in under five minutes during a busy checkout window. Mixed execution across teams.",
        "source_3": "I stayed three nights for a design conference and had a smooth stay end to end. Check-in took under five minutes, my king room on 9 was quiet despite the downtown setting, and the shower had strong water pressure. The front desk sent up a kettle within ten minutes when I asked. I liked the lobby coffee stand in the mornings before walking down 3rd Street to Moscone, which took me maybe five minutes door to door. My conference rate kept costs in check, and the whole setup made it easy to focus on sessions instead of logistics. I’d book the same place next trip to downtown SF.",
        "source_4": "I picked this hotel for the vibe but my priority was daily laps. There’s no indoor pool, and the desk offered a “partner gym” pass 0.8 miles away for a fee, which didn’t fit between early sessions. The on-site fitness room had four treadmills, a couple of ellipticals, and dumbbells up to 50 lbs, but no rower or space for mobility work when more than two people were in there. The sauna was taped off with an “out of order” sign both days, and the rooftop bar area was closed for private events both evenings. If hotel facilities are your routine, plan a backup.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on price: my weekday rate showed $219 when I booked, but the final bill stacked up with a $35 per-night “destination” fee, $70 for valet plus tax, and a charge for the bottled water on the desk I thought was included. Two nights ran me $724 all-in. Wi‑Fi was covered by the fee, but breakfast wasn’t, and nearby garages wanted $40–$50 if you self-parked. For anyone not expensing a convention trip, the add-ons change the math compared to the headline rate."
