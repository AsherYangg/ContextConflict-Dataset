        "source_1": "I picked the Agora mainly for the central address, but the street-facing room made sleep tricky. The cafés downstairs kept their terraces open past 2 a.m., and the bottle collection and delivery trucks showed up around 6 a.m. for a double hit of noise. The nearest metro entrance by the corner was taped off for works all weekend, so I had to walk over to Châtelet—about 8–10 minutes with luggage. Getting to Notre-Dame also took longer than expected because the riverside path by the construction fencing was closed; it ended up being closer to a 12-minute walk at my pace.",
        "source_2": "My experience was all about the front-desk interactions. I arrived at 1:30 p.m. after emailing the week before to ask about early check-in; the reply had said they would “try,” but at the desk I was told to come back at 3. After returning at 3:15, there was a mix-up where my reservation showed as canceled in their system, and it took about 25 minutes while the night manager phoned someone to fix it. I asked for an extra pillow twice and finally got one the following morning. On departure day, I requested a 5 a.m. taxi to CDG; the car arrived at 5:20, and the driver said he’d been booked last minute.",
        "source_3": "I stayed three nights for a long weekend and used the Agora as a base to explore on foot. My room was compact but had everything I needed, the bathroom had good water pressure, and housekeeping kept things tidy. The staff printed my timed-entry Louvre tickets so I didn’t have to queue. I grabbed espresso at the bakery across the street each morning, walked to Notre-Dame in roughly five to seven minutes, and hopped on Line 1 at Châtelet for the Arc de Triomphe in under twenty minutes. I’d choose the same place for another short city break.",
        "source_4": "For anyone sensitive to building quirks, a heads-up: the elevator is small and stopped half a floor short a couple of times, so I had to carry my suitcase a flight. The room itself felt tight; I could open my carry-on only by putting it on the bed. The shower drained slowly and the water swung from warm to quite hot midstream. I could hear conversations from the corridor and the neighboring room’s TV until after midnight. The corridor had a strong cleaning-product smell in the late afternoon.",
        "source_5": "I interacted mostly with the staff and left impressed by how they handled little snags. I misplaced my printed train tickets and the afternoon clerk, Camille, called SNCF, retrieved the reservation code, and printed replacements. When I came in soaked from a downpour, the night manager handed me extra towels and offered hot tea while the lobby heater dried my coat. They arranged a 4:30 a.m. wake-up call and had my taxi waiting at 4:35, plus they kept my prescription drops in their staff fridge without fuss.",
        "source_6": "I booked because I wanted to be close to the river, and the location delivered. From the door, I could be on the Seine in a couple of minutes, and Notre-Dame was a straightforward walk—two bridges and I was there in about five minutes when the sidewalks weren’t crowded. The Châtelet–Les Halles connections made getting to both airports simple; I took the RER B to CDG with one quick transfer. Even late at night, there were open crêperies and a small grocery around the corner, so I never felt stranded."
