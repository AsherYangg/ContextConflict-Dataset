        "source_1": "I bought this to replace Nabisco shredded wheat and tested it side by side. Spoon for spoon, the Post version hits with a clear sweetness even before adding fruit or milk. The label puts sugar and brown sugar right after wheat, and it tastes like it—there’s a light glaze that lingers on the tongue and turns the last sips of milk noticeably sugary.",
        "source_2": "I focus on breakfast foods that don’t lean on added sugars, and this didn’t fit my routine. The ingredient list has sugar and brown sugar high up, and after a bowl I felt the kind of quick lift that makes me snacky again an hour later. I want something I can eat plain with milk without getting that sweet milk at the bottom, so I moved back to an unsweetened option.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, this cereal works for me. The hint of sweetness means I don’t reach for honey or banana, the wheat squares stay intact long enough to finish a bowl without turning mushy, and a serving carries me through to lunch. My kids actually finish their bowls now instead of leaving half, which cuts down on waste in the mornings.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on ingredients only: I compared boxes in the aisle—Nabisco’s plain shredded wheat is just wheat, while this Post version lists sugar and brown sugar in the top three. That tells me the flavor direction right away. If you’re trying to limit added sugars at breakfast, the panel makes the choice pretty clear without even opening the box.",
        "source_5": "I switched over from Nabisco because my family kept calling the plain version “cardboard.” This one has a touch of brown sugar that comes through even with unsweetened almond milk, and it pairs well with frozen blueberries. I’ve reordered twice and plan to keep it in the pantry since everyone actually finishes a bowl.",
        "source_6": "After a week with the box, I’m going back to Nabisco. The cereal leaves the milk tasting like syrup, and the sweetness masks the grainy, toasty flavor I expect from shredded wheat. Seeing two kinds of sugar so high on the ingredient list sealed the decision for me."
