        "source_1": "I ordered the 5‑lb bag on December 18 and it landed on my porch the evening of the 20th. I split the bag into mason jars for the kids’ stockings and still had enough to fill two big bowls for the living room. The wrappers were intact, no tears in the outer bag, and the pieces looked uniform. During our Christmas movie night, people kept reaching into the bowl, and by the 26th the jars in the pantry were already down by half.",
        "source_2": "Narrow focus: availability. I don’t struggle to find these locally at all—our neighborhood market on Maple Ave keeps a bin by the registers, and Target stocks the same variety year‑round. I only bought this listing because I wanted the 5‑lb size for a party candy bar. If I just need a small pack, I grab it during a regular grocery run; it’s not a hunt in my area.",
        "source_3": "Narrow focus: shipment. My box sat in “label created” for three days and missed the estimated delivery by almost a week. The tracking finally moved after I opened a chat, and the package arrived on the 27th with one corner of the bag scuffed and a handful of pieces loose in the box. I had planned to set these out for Christmas Eve, so I ended up making a last‑minute store run instead.",
        "source_4": "Narrow focus: food quality. The pieces in my bag were oddly firm, and several were fused together as if they’d been stored warm and then cooled. I had to pry clusters apart with a spoon, and some stuck to the candy dish. The flavor seemed faint compared to what I get from the bulk bins at our mall shop, so I ended up using most of this bag for baking mix‑ins rather than setting them out for snacking.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: The jumbo size felt convenient when I clicked “buy,” but it turned into clutter fast. We portioned the bag into zip bags with a scale (4 ounces each), and after the initial novelty wore off, the pouches lingered in the pantry. A clip didn’t keep the main bag closed well, so a few servings picked up a chewy texture. I eventually brought half to the office break room, which cleared space but wasn’t the plan when I ordered."
