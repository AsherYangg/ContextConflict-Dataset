        "source_1": "I checked in bleary-eyed after a red-eye, and the front desk agent noticed and offered hot tea while they rushed my room. They found a quiet corner room, brought up a foam pillow within ten minutes, and set a wake-up call for a meeting I kept changing. Housekeeping left extra water and a note after they saw my running shoes drying by the window. Every request—extra towels, printing a boarding pass—was handled without me having to repeat myself.",
        "source_2": "My room (804) had a wall AC that sounded like a box fan. Even at the lowest temp setting it hovered around 74°F, and the unit cycled on and off with a clunk that woke me up. Maintenance came up, cleaned a filter, and said the older units are due to be swapped; it didn’t make much difference. I ended up sleeping with earplugs and a damp washcloth on my forehead.",
        "source_3": "I spent a full week at Hotel Renew while working at the convention center. The bed and linens held up well, Wi‑Fi never dropped during video calls, and the beach was a five‑minute walk for morning swims. The staff greeted me by name and held packages without fuss. The AC looked dated but kept the room comfortable, and overall the place felt like a calm base between meetings. If I’m back for a week-long project, I’d book the same setup.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about climate control, so here’s just my AC report: room 1012 cooled from 75°F to 68°F in about twenty minutes, the fan on low was barely audible, and the thermostat responded quickly when I bumped it up at night. No musty smell, no dripping, and the blackout curtains didn’t block the vent. Slept straight through even with afternoon sun hitting that side of the building.",
        "source_5": "I split my four-night stay between Renew and the Hilton down the street to compare for future trips. The Hilton’s rooms ran larger with brighter bathrooms and a faster elevator bank, and check-in there took two minutes via kiosk. At Renew, the boutique vibe was cozy but the lobby felt cramped at peak times and the gym arrangement required a walk to a partner facility. Given the small price difference on my dates, I’d choose the Hilton next time.",
        "source_6": "I travel with medication that needs refrigeration and depend on quick coordination. At Renew, the staff kept saying “we’ll be right up” with a mini-fridge but it didn’t arrive for three hours, and my follow-up calls were routed to voicemail. A late checkout request was declined even though the hallway looked half empty on my floor that morning. They were courteous in tone, but my requests seemed to fall through the cracks at shift change."
