        "source_1": "I bought the Redmi mainly for the camera after my MI 6 Pro started acting up. Over a week in Jaipur’s old city markets, photos of spices and fabric stalls came out sharp, with colors that matched what I saw. Portrait mode handled my kid’s birthday indoors well; edge detection didn’t clip hair. Night mode on the fort isn’t miracle-level, but I could read signage without blur. Video from a moving auto had only mild shake, and the microphone picked up street music clearly. For what I need—family albums and Instagram stories—the camera delivers.",
        "source_2": "Battery life surprised me in the wrong way: dual SIM (Jio + Airtel), Bluetooth on for my watch, and two hours of YouTube plus a 45-minute Maps navigation drain it from 100% to 38% by late afternoon. Screen-on time sits around 4 to 4.5 hours. Overnight, with nothing running, it drops 12–15%. The phone warms near the camera during Instagram Reels, and the bundled charger takes a little over two hours to reach full. I now keep a 10,000 mAh power bank in my bag for late meetings.",
        "source_3": "I’ve used the Redmi for a month as my main device for work and home. Calls are clear on the metro, the speaker is loud enough for podcasts while cooking, and the display stays readable under Delhi sun at noon. MIUI throws some recommendations, but I turned most of them off and don’t see popups anymore. Banking apps with OTPs open quickly, and casual games like Subway Surfers run smoothly without stutter. Fingerprint unlock is reliable even with slightly sweaty hands after a run. For the price I paid during the festive sale, it feels like a sensible daily driver.",
        "source_4": "I switched from an MI 6 Pro expecting a step up, but the Redmi feels like a sideways move. The camera hunts focus when my toddler doesn’t sit still, and indoor shots of birthday cake look soft. With WhatsApp, Gmail, and Teams running, the battery dips fast enough that I’m hunting for sockets by early evening. The plastic back scuffs within two weeks despite a case, and the haptic feedback is buzzy, not crisp. If I had waited, I might have picked a Realme with cleaner software or stretched for a OnePlus.",
        "source_5": "Battery has been a non-issue for me. On a typical office day—Slack, email, two hours of Spotify on Bluetooth, an hour of Hotstar streaming during commute, and constant 4G—the phone ends with 30–40% left. Screen-on time hovers around 6.5 to 7 hours. Standby drain overnight is 3–4%. Using a 33W charger, a top-up from 20% to 80% happens in about 40 minutes. I haven’t seen heating except when shooting 4K clips at a wedding, and even then it settles once I stop recording.",
        "source_6": "I mostly shoot indoors at my store, and that’s where the Redmi struggles. Under warm LED lights, colors shift toward orange, and product labels look soft unless I tap to focus every time. Shutter lag means I miss candid moments with customers. Night mode smooths faces to the point of looking like filters, and 1080p video shows micro-jitters even when I walk slowly. Exporting to WhatsApp, the compression makes it worse, so I end up retaking shots with my colleague’s older OnePlus."
