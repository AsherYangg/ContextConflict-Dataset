        "source_1": "I stayed one night before a 6 a.m. flight and the place did exactly what I needed. Check-in took maybe two minutes, the hallways were quiet, and my queen room had a couple of scuffs on the dresser but crisp sheets and a decent mattress. The bathroom was tight—pedestal sink and a corner shower—but everything looked freshly wiped down. Breakfast started early; I grabbed a bagel, cereal, and made a waffle while the coffee brewed. The airport shuttle pulled up at 4:30 a.m. on the dot and the ride took about seven minutes, which made the morning painless.",
        "source_2": "My focus is cleanliness of the room: in 214, I found a long strand of hair in the tub, dust along the baseboards, and a sticky ring on the desk where a drink must’ve been. The AC filter was gray and the vent blew a musty smell for the first few minutes. I called the front desk and housekeeping came by, but crumbs under the armchair and a smear on the mirror were still there afterward. I ended up wiping down the nightstand myself and putting a towel over the desk to use my laptop.",
        "source_3": "If bathroom space matters to you, this one felt like a ship cabin. With the door closed, my knees nearly touched it when I sat, and there was nowhere to set toiletries except the toilet tank. The shower curtain kept brushing against me because the tub is narrow, and the towel bar is so close to the sink that my elbow hit it while washing my face. I’d guess the whole room is maybe 4 by 6 feet, so it’s manageable solo but awkward if you’re wrangling a toddler or sharing.",
        "source_4": "I picked this motel for the shuttle and had a rough go. Landing at 10:05 p.m., I called and was told it runs every half hour at :15 and :45, so I waited at the B3 island; nothing came at 10:15 or 10:45. The driver finally rolled up around 11:05 and said traffic was heavy, which left a few of us pretty anxious in the chilly wind. The next morning’s outbound run was also off schedule by about 20 minutes, and the van filled up fast, so a couple had to wait for the next one.",
        "source_5": "For an overall take: I booked a king in the back building and it looked recently refreshed—new vinyl plank floors, modern light fixtures, and USB outlets on both sides of the bed. The mattress felt new and the blackout curtains did their job. The bathroom had a wide vanity with plenty of counter space and a glass walk-in shower, not at all like the cramped setups I’d read about. Breakfast was busy but staff kept refilling batter and cereal, and I snagged a table near the window. The shuttle at 5:30 a.m. loaded promptly and I was at my terminal in under ten minutes.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on breakfast and value: my reservation page said “breakfast included,” but at check-in I was told it wasn’t available for my rate through the third-party site and that I could purchase it for $7.50. I paid anyway and found the waffle iron out of service, the juice watery, and the bagels a bit dry around the edges. There were only a handful of seats, so I balanced a plate on my knee in the lobby. In hindsight, I would’ve skipped it and grabbed something at the airport."
