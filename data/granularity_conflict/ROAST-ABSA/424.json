        "source_1": "I rely on the Nord 2T for tethering my work laptop, and the hotspot has been solid for me. On Airtel 5G in Bengaluru, I typically see 70–110 Mbps on Speedtest, and a 90-minute Zoom call over the 5 GHz hotspot didn’t drop once. I’ve also used it to update my PS5 games over Wi‑Fi hotspot without the connection stalling. Indoors, speeds dip a bit but still stream 1080p YouTube on my iPad smoothly. The only hiccup I notice is in basement parking where the phone falls back to 4G and takes 10–15 seconds to climb back, but once it does, data is steady.",
        "source_2": "I’m having a tough time with the data connection on this phone. In Gurugram and South Delhi, the signal bars show 4G+ yet apps stop loading until I toggle airplane mode, and my iPad gets kicked off the hotspot every 10–15 minutes. I swapped my Vi SIM for Jio, reset network settings, and even changed APN values as the care team suggested, but the behaviour stayed the same. At the same desk, my wife’s Pixel streams Spotify without a hiccup while the Nord 2T times out on simple web pages. Calls are fine, but mobile data feels like a coin toss throughout the day.",
        "source_3": "I bought the Nord 2T mainly for photos and it’s been a pleasant surprise. Shot my sister’s sangeet on the main 50 MP camera and the low‑light shots with Night mode held detail in faces without smearing, with OIS helping keep things sharp even with a 1–2 sec exposure. Daytime portraits had natural-looking skin tones and decent edge detection, and the ultrawide was usable for group shots. Video at 4K 30 looked stable during a walk, with less jitter than I expected. I also tried the stock camera’s Pro mode for a sunset and got a clean RAW file to tweak later.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on the battery, mine drains faster than I’d like when I keep the screen at 90 Hz and mobile data on. With mixed use (Reddit, maps, 30 minutes of BGMI, and an hour of Instagram Reels), I hover around 4.5–5 hours of screen‑on time before hitting 10%. The phone warms near the camera island during games and navigation, which seems to speed up the drop. The 80 W charger is convenient—around 35 minutes from 15% to full for me—but after seven months AccuBattery estimates health at 86%. Overnight idle drain is about 6–8% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on, which feels higher than my previous device.",
        "source_5": "As an all‑round daily driver, this phone has treated me well over six months. OxygenOS feels clean, I don’t get hammered by ads, and the haptics are crisp when typing. The fingerprint reader unlocks instantly, and the stereo speakers are loud enough for podcasts while cooking. I take a lot of calls and the earpiece is clear, while mobile data on Vi in Pune has been consistent for email, banking apps, and Google Maps. Charging is quick enough that I no longer think about battery during the day, and I haven’t had to visit a service center.",
        "source_6": "My experience started smooth and then went downhill after about eight weeks. Apps began freezing randomly, the keyboard lagged, and during calls the screen often stayed black after moving the phone away from my ear, making it hard to end calls. Bluetooth audio stutters in my Hyundai’s head unit even at short range, and the UI exhibits brief micro‑stutters when switching between the camera and WhatsApp. A factory reset and a service‑center firmware flash improved things for a week, then the glitches returned. I’m now carrying a backup phone because I can’t trust this one for work days."
