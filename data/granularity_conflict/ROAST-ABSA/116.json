        "source_1": "I track battery closely: dual SIM (both on 4G), Bluetooth connected to earbuds most of the day, auto-brightness hovering near 50%, an hour of YouTube, Maps for 30 minutes, and a bunch of WhatsApp voice notes. I consistently see a bit over 7 hours of screen time and still plug in at night with around 25% left. Standby drain is minimal—2–3% lost while I sleep. With the included 10W charger it goes from 15% to full in about 1 hour 50 minutes.",
        "source_2": "I care about audio, and the loudspeaker surprised me. In my kitchen with the exhaust fan on, I listen to podcasts comfortably at around 70% volume with no rattling from the back cover. Ringtones cut through traffic when I’m biking, and the alarm has woken me from the next room. Call earpiece volume is adequate in a crowded café, and the mic picks up my voice cleanly on Zoom without me having to shout.",
        "source_3": "Spent a weekend testing only the camera. Daylight photos are sharp enough to read distant street signs when I crop in, and colors look natural. HDR keeps the sky from washing out, and portrait mode does a decent job with hair strands without chewing up the edges. 1080p video while walking looks steady, and autofocus locks quickly on pets. Under warm indoor lighting there’s a slight yellow shift, but tapping to focus/adjust fixes it.",
        "source_4": "I use the side fingerprint reader as my primary unlock. Out of the box it required a firm press, but after switching on “lift to wake” and enabling the touch-to-unlock option, I can tap the button from a black screen and it’s on the home screen in roughly half a second. I registered my thumb twice at different angles, and it works reliably even when the phone is on my desk without me picking it up.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two weeks: it looks the part, but daily use grates on me. The speaker struggles on a crowded bus, and I have to cup the earpiece to hear callers on the train. The rear camera hesitates before shooting; indoor photos come out smeary, and kids’ photos blur because the shutter isn’t ready. The side sensor is picky about thumb placement, so I end up typing the PIN more than I’d like. With two SIMs and moderate browsing, I’m down to single digits by late evening, and I’ve started carrying a power bank.",
        "source_6": "Using it as a secondary phone for my work line, I’m pretty content. Face unlock gets me in as soon as I raise the phone, and the side sensor works when I grab it from my pocket without looking. For my pattern—lots of calls, WhatsApp, banking apps, rideshare, and casual photos at lunch—the battery comfortably makes it through a day and a half. The speaker is clear enough for meeting alerts, and quick daylight snaps are good for sharing in family chats, which is all I need."
