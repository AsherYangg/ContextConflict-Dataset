        "source_1": "I took the class over three weekends and stuck to the suggested schedule. The videos are short enough to keep momentum, and the quizzes right after each section made me verify I actually understood what was just shown. By the third week, I could write a small script to read an email log and count the most frequent sender. The auto-grader caught a couple of off-by-one mistakes, and Dr. Severance’s short anecdotes kept me engaged. I wrapped up and immediately enrolled in the next course in the sequence.",
        "source_2": "On the exercises specifically: most of the answers are essentially typed out in the lecture right before the assignment. For the “minimum and maximum” problem, the exact loop structure is demonstrated minutes earlier. The grader seemed picky about formatting and even variable names, and when I tried a cleaner approach using built-ins, it flagged it as incorrect. There weren’t stretch tasks or open-ended prompts, so I rarely had to design a solution from a blank file.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the assignments’ breadth: the repetition helped me build muscle memory. I went from simple string slicing to counting words in mbox-short.txt, and the practice required me to handle blank lines and weird timestamps without crashing. The progression—print, input, conditionals, loops, then files—made it clear how each concept stacked on the previous one.",
        "source_4": "Regarding the instructor’s involvement: forum threads about Week 1 installation sat unanswered for days. I posted logs and screenshots, tagged a mentor and Dr. Severance, and ended up relying on other learners’ guesses. A couple of lectures include typos that he corrects on the fly, but the video doesn’t get patched, so I had to keep pausing to compare the final code to the earlier mistake.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the course didn’t match what I was hoping for. The first hour leans heavily on setup across Windows/Mac/Linux, and several examples stay in the realm of tiny text files with predictable formats. I was looking for coverage beyond the basics—APIs, JSON, or small real datasets—but the scope stops earlier than that. I left before finishing the certificate because it wasn’t aligned with my needs.",
        "source_6": "Just on clarity of explanations: the flow made sense—variables, then a “grade calculator” to demonstrate branching, followed by loops that read a file line by line. The captions matched the code on screen, and the short checkpoints after each segment helped me catch misunderstandings quickly without having to rewatch an entire week."
