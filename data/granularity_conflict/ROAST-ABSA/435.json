        "source_1": "I booked because the website made the place look like a calm, spa-like boutique. At check-in around 9 p.m., I was given Room 517. The lobby lighting and music matched the photos, but once upstairs the room felt tighter than expected. The bathroom was so narrow I could touch both side walls with my elbows while standing at the sink, and the door barely cleared the toilet. When I filled the tub to rinse off my feet, a small dead bug floated up near the drain. Engineering came with a net and housekeeping re-cleaned, but the whole “glossy brochure” vibe faded fast.",
        "source_2": "I’ll focus on bathroom size because that’s what affected me most. Queen room, 6th floor, facing the alley. The bathroom had maybe a hand’s width of clearance between the toilet and the door; my knees grazed it when seated. The sink counter fit only a travel kit and a toothbrush—my partner’s cosmetic bag had to live on the closed toilet lid. In the shower, my elbows kept bumping the glass. I ended up doing makeup at the desk because there wasn’t space to spread anything out in there.",
        "source_3": "I care a lot about tub hygiene because I like to soak after flights. In Room 333, I ran hot water and noticed a dark speck circling the drain—turned out to be a small beetle. I drained it, called downstairs, and housekeeping arrived in about 15 minutes with a scrub brush and cleaner. They did a once-over, but the stopper still had a gritty ring around it, so I skipped the bath and used the shower. They offered extra towels and a bathmat, which was thoughtful, but the first look at the tub stuck with me.",
        "source_4": "My experience with the bathroom was totally different. Room 924, corner king, three nights for a conference. The bathroom had a long counter with space for my dopp kit and laptop bag, plus a soaking tub that hit mid-chest when seated. I ran two baths during the stay; the water was clear, the porcelain was smooth, and I didn’t see a single insect. Housekeeping folded the bath towels into little fans each day, and the tub filled in about six minutes, which is quicker than at most city hotels I’ve used.",
        "source_5": "As an overall stay, the property matched what I saw online. The check-in line moved quickly at 4 p.m., the lobby looked exactly like the photos with the big plant wall, and my 8th-floor room faced the courtyard so it was quiet at night. The bathroom wasn’t cavernous, but the layout worked, and the tub looked freshly wiped when I arrived; I rinsed it and took a short soak without incident. The desk had enough outlets for my gear, and housekeeping refreshed the room daily without moving my things around."
