        "source_1": "I’ve been using this as my daily driver for two weeks with two SIMs (Jio primary, Airtel work) in Bengaluru. My day is mostly WhatsApp, Gmail, Maps for my commute (~45 minutes), and Spotify over Bluetooth in the car. The interface handles these fine, and I’m able to jump between Maps and Spotify without either app restarting. I noticed one or two brief hitches scrolling heavy news sites, but nothing show‑stopping. Battery gets me through a full day with around 20–30% left, and a top‑up from 15% to full takes about 1 hour 50 minutes on the included charger. Call quality has been clear and the signal stays steady inside my concrete office building. The rear camera struggles indoors, but the selfie cam has been perfectly usable for daylight video calls. I couldn’t find a native call recorder in the dialer.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on battery life: I do field sales, so my screen stays on for navigation a lot. On a typical day I run Google Maps/Waze for 3–4 hours, keep mobile data on, answer calls, take a few photos of storefronts, and check WhatsApp constantly. With brightness around 60%, I end my shift with roughly 25–35% remaining. Overnight standby drain is minimal (2–3% over 7 hours). I’m not hunting for chargers midday anymore.",
        "source_3": "I bought it mainly for online classes and video calls, and the front camera has held up better than I expected. In a bright room or under a single tube light, my Google Meet feed looks clean and doesn’t pulse exposure when I move. Skin tones aren’t plasticky, and focus locks quickly at arm’s length. I’ve also taken a few selfies outdoors that looked crisp on Instagram without heavy editing. The rear camera gets soft in dim cafés, but for front‑facing calls and casual snaps, I’m satisfied.",
        "source_4": "I’m on a Vodafone‑Idea SIM in a semi‑rural area near Nashik, and the network behavior on this phone has been erratic. Signal bars jump from four down to one in the same spot in my living room, and I’ve had three dropped calls during a single 20‑minute conversation with a client. Mobile data often flips from 4G to H+, and pages crawl until I toggle airplane mode. Locking LTE‑only improves data but then outgoing calls sometimes won’t go through. Wi‑Fi at home stays solid.",
        "source_5": "After installing the latest OTA (build X.Y.Z), the stock dialer gained a Record button. I tested it by calling my bank and the saved AAC file captured both sides clearly in the Recorder folder. On performance, I usually keep Facebook, Chrome (6–8 tabs), Paytm, and Swiggy open; switching between them doesn’t force reloads, and typing in messaging apps feels consistent. Only when I launch a heavy game do I see an app get evicted from memory."
