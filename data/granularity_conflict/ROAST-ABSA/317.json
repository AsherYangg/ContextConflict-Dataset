        "source_1": "I ordered the 19‑piece Godiva gold box for my sister’s Friday dinner, with a delivery estimate of Thursday by 9 p.m. Tracking sat in Newark for almost a full day and the package didn’t land until Saturday afternoon. The outer carton was warm, the ice packs were slushy, and the ribbon had fused to the lid. I ended up grabbing a last‑minute backup gift, so I can’t weigh in on the flavor.",
        "source_2": "I messaged the seller right after checkout asking them to leave out the receipt and add a short note. They replied within half an hour confirming it. The box showed up two days earlier than the window, the presentation looked gift‑ready straight out of the shipper, and my friend texted photos of empty wrappers ten minutes after opening. From order to delivery, the whole thing was smooth.",
        "source_3": "I’ve bought Godiva for years, but this listing hit hard on cost. The 19‑piece box worked out to just over $2 per piece after tax and shipping, and the box itself is smaller than the photos suggest—fits in one hand. My local chocolatier sells comparable truffles for about $1.25 each. Not judging flavor here; I’m strictly talking dollars and size.",
        "source_4": "I budget for Godiva when I want a dressed‑up gift. The per‑ounce rate is higher than grocery brands, but the packaging, consistent sizing, and polished presentation save me the time of assembling something that actually looks special. I’ve tried cheaper assortments that arrived with scuffed shells; this one shows up looking ready for a bow, which makes the spend sensible for me.",
        "source_5": "I opened the assortment at work and passed it around. The dark shells had a clean snap, the coffee piece tasted like actual espresso instead of syrup, and the hazelnut praline was silky with no grit. No bloom on any of the pieces, and the flavor chart matched what we tasted without needing to guess.",
        "source_6": "I sent this as a birthday surprise. The carrier missed the original date and the gift note wasn’t in the box. When my cousin opened it on video chat, a few pieces had grayish streaks and one caramel had leaked into the tray. I wrote to the seller and got a response two days later with a small coupon. Between the timing, presentation, and follow‑up, the surprise lost its punch."
