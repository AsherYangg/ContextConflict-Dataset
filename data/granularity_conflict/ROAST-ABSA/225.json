        "source_1": "I bought this JBM to relive a trip memory and it actually hit the mark for me overall. Roast date was stamped three weeks prior, and the beans were evenly browned with a light sheen. I brewed multiple cups in a V60 at 1:15 and 200°F, and the cups came out silky with a mellow acidity, almond and cocoa notes, and a clean finish. I also tried it as a French press for brunch, and the body turned richer without muddiness. For an everyday cup, it felt balanced and easy to drink.",
        "source_2": "My note is strictly about bean cleanliness. When I poured the whole beans into a tray to weigh my dose (18 g for espresso), I kept finding small flakes of husk and a few papery bits. After grinding, the chaff clung to the dosing cup and stuck to the basket, and I had to blow it off before tamping. It also collected in my pour-over filter and slowed the drawdown. I ended up sifting the next few doses to keep the workflow sane.",
        "source_3": "I’m only commenting on acidity because that’s what matters to me. I have a sensitive stomach, and this coffee sits gently even when I brew a stronger 1:14 ratio in a Chemex. No sharp bite, no lingering burn, and I can drink a second cup mid-morning without reaching for antacids. If you’re looking specifically for a gentler cup on the gut, this fits that need.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the bag I received felt underwhelming compared with cups I’ve had in Kingston and Montego Bay. The aromatics were faint when I opened the valve bag, and the first brew (Kalita 185, 1:16) tasted thin with a generic, diner-style profile rather than the layered sweetness I was hoping for. Pulling a shot on my Gaggia didn’t help; the crema was pale and the shot came out flat even with a tighter 1:2 ratio at 30 seconds. For the price and the name on the label, I expected more character.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on aroma: the scent when I cracked the bag was captivating—honey, toasted nuts, and a hint of cedar. Grinding released a strong sweet smell that lingered in the kitchen, and even the bloom on a 205°F pour-over filled the room. If you care about how a coffee smells while brewing and don’t obsess over cup complexity, this part delivers."
