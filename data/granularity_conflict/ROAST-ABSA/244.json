        "source_1": "I picked up this phone with a fresh Jio SIM specifically to try 5G, and it’s been a solid daily driver. In Mumbai Central I ran a few tests and saw downloads around 350–450 Mbps, and streaming a full match replay while commuting didn’t hiccup. The display holds up under direct sun at half brightness, calls sound clean on both ends, and the speakers are loud enough for podcasts in the kitchen. I’ve run into a couple of quirks while gaming—during one evening session of eFootball 23, my on-screen pass button ignored taps twice in the same match—but outside of that, messages, banking apps, and photos are all snappy and predictable.",
        "source_2": "Battery life focus: I’m on the road most days with Bluetooth on, two email accounts syncing, and about 2 hours of YouTube. I consistently finish with 35–45% left after 6.5–8 hours of screen-on time. A 25-minute ride on Google Maps over 5G eats roughly 6–7%. Overnight drain is 1–2% with Wi‑Fi on. The included charger takes me from 15% to 80% in about 45 minutes and to full in roughly 85–90 minutes. Most importantly, I don’t feel the need to carry a power bank, even on days when I squeeze in a 45-minute game of eFootball 23.",
        "source_3": "Gaming controls focus: I bought this for casual football gaming, and eFootball 23 has been a headache. In-match controls intermittently stop responding—swipe to sprint doesn’t trigger, and the shoot/pass buttons act like dead zones near the lower right corner. It happens mid-attack, not just from the kickoff screen. I tried toggling 120 Hz off, disabling three-finger screenshot, and even turned off gesture navigation thinking the edge area was interfering. Reinstalled the game, cleared cache, and updated to the latest patch; the training mode is fine, but ranked matches still drop inputs at random. Outside of the game, touch works normally, so it feels like a software conflict.",
        "source_4": "Performance focus: I mostly play Asphalt 9 and some eFootball 23 at 60 fps, and the phone keeps the frame rate steady for 30–40 minutes without getting uncomfortably warm. Touch response feels immediate when dribbling and passing, and the gyroscope tracks cleanly for quick turns. I keep background apps to a minimum and use Game Mode to block notifications; with that setup, even late-game moments are smooth. Only when a WhatsApp call tries to come through do I notice a half-second stutter, then it settles.",
        "source_5": "Software reliability focus: Day to day, the interface is quick, but every so often something gets in the way. Twice this week, the quick settings shade wouldn’t expand until I locked and unlocked the phone. In Chrome, the back gesture occasionally doesn’t register on the first try, as if the edge sensitivity shifts. I also saw the keyboard appear with a delay when replying from the notification pop-down. None of these stick around after a restart, yet they pop up often enough to be noticeable when juggling work chats and music controls.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after two weeks: On paper—price, processor, and 5G bands—it checked every box for me, and my friends talked it up. In practice, I keep circling back to one sticking point: touch input goes flaky during eFootball 23 matches, and that throws off what should be relaxing breaks. Outside of gaming it’s dependable, and the battery easily covers long days, but the sporadic in-match non-responsiveness has me sidestepping games altogether, which defeats one of my main reasons for upgrading."
