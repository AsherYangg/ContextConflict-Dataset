        "source_1": "I booked a weekend stay with my partner and had a room facing the internal courtyard on a higher floor, which made nights calm enough that we slept through until the late morning. Check-in took just a few minutes, and we were walking to the Prado in about 15 minutes after dropping our bags; the Sevilla metro stop is close by, so getting around was easy. We ended up spending more time than expected in the lounge and bar area because it felt relaxed and comfortable, and the afternoon tea came with warm scones and generous jam and cream. Our rate was booked a few months ahead and included breakfast, and the team at breakfast learned our coffee order by the second day.",
        "source_2": "This is just about breakfast. I went down around 9:15 on two weekdays and found the hot items lukewarm both times—scrambled eggs were soft but not hot, and the bacon had gone tough under the lamps. The buffet looked big at first glance, but the fruit was mostly melon and pineapple, and pastries ran out by 9:30 without being refilled promptly. There was a queue of eight people for the espresso machine, and when I asked for oat milk, it took close to ten minutes to appear. I ended up grabbing a yogurt and leaving because I had meetings.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the room only (512): wood floors with a solid feel, a padded headboard with individual reading lights, and plenty of outlets—including a USB-C—right by the bed. The bathroom had a rainfall shower with steady water pressure and no temperature swings; grout and glass were spotless. Blackout curtains actually blocked the light, and the double glazing took the edge off outside noise. The desk was wide enough for a laptop and notebook, and the AC held at 21°C without that constant drone you get in older places.",
        "source_4": "My experience was mostly about the staff. I arrived just before midnight after a delayed flight, and there was one person at the front desk handling three arrivals; it took about 25 minutes to get a key. I asked for a toothbrush and was told housekeeping was closed, and the bar staff—setting up for breakfast—wouldn’t pour a glass of water, suggesting I use the minibar instead. The next morning was a different story: the concierge circled tapas spots on a map and got us a last-minute museum slot, which was a lifesaver. Housekeeping didn’t reach our floor until late afternoon the second day, so we had to call twice for fresh towels.",
        "source_5": "On location: if you want the center, this nails it—two blocks from Gran Vía and about seven minutes to Puerta del Sol on foot, with plenty of buses and a metro line nearby. The flip side is noise if you face the street. My third-floor room picked up scooter buzz and bar chatter until around 2 a.m., and the windows didn’t seem to be the newest. I switched to a courtyard room the next night and it was much calmer, but the view was mostly air-conditioning units and service rooftops. It’s a trade-off between views and sleep.",
        "source_6": "From a value perspective, the base rate for our long weekend looked fair, but the add-ons piled up. Breakfast was 22 € per person when not bundled, afternoon tea in the bar—pleasant as it was—came to 56 € for two with service, bottled water in the room was 4 € each, and late checkout was quoted at 15 € per hour. The lobby and lounge felt well kept, and being able to walk everywhere cut down on taxis, yet the final bill at checkout was higher than we expected once everything was tallied."
