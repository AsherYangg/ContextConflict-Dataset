        "source_1": "I stayed over a long weekend and took the metro everywhere since the station is just around the corner. The front desk had me in a room by noon, and they walked me through the keycard system and Wi‑Fi without rushing. My room faced a small park, and I ended most evenings with a stroll there; the streets felt calm after dinner time. Breakfast had fresh fruit, cured meats, and hot options, and the servers kept coffees flowing even on the busier Sunday. The room itself had polished wood floors, thick curtains, and a firm mattress, and the corridors were quiet enough that I barely heard other guests.",
        "source_2": "I booked the place mainly for the breakfast because I had early meetings, and I focused on that one part of the stay. The buffet opened at 7, but the hot dishes weren’t actually hot—scrambled eggs were lukewarm, and the sausages sat under a lamp that didn’t seem to do much. The espresso machine hiccupped with a “water tank empty” alert twice, so there was a small crowd waiting for refills. Pastries tasted like they’d been out since the day before, with the croissants losing their crunch. If breakfast is your priority, bring low expectations or plan to grab something at the café near the metro.",
        "source_3": "I’m particular about cleanliness, so I inspected the room carefully. There was a thin line of dust along the headboard and a smudge on the mirror above the desk that looked like it hadn’t been wiped in a while. The bathroom grout near the shower base had dark patches, and I found two long hairs in the sink on arrival. Housekeeping did replace towels daily, but they missed the small wastebasket by the desk until I asked at the front desk. The room felt tidy at a glance, yet the little details told a different story.",
        "source_4": "On a short business trip, I tried to get a sense of the hotel overall and ran into a few snags. Check‑in took about 25 minutes because the system kept rejecting my prepayment, and I was handed a key that didn’t match my room number; two elevator trips later, I was back at the desk to fix it. The décor is stylish, but the bed had a noticeable dip on the left side, and I could hear delivery trucks outside at 5 a.m. on both mornings. Breakfast turned into a queue for the single toaster and a wait for plates, which ate into the time I thought I’d have to prep for meetings. The metro being close helped me reach clients quickly, but the overall experience felt more work than it should.",
        "source_5": "I picked this place for the location and paid attention to nothing else. The metro is indeed a short walk, but the route runs under an overpass with dim lighting late at night, and there’s a bar strip a block away that keeps music going past midnight. Morning deliveries and trash collection on the side street start early, so light sleepers might notice it. The park looks lovely in the afternoon—great for a jog—but I wouldn’t linger there after dusk because the footpaths aren’t well lit. If you’re expecting a secluded, quiet area, the reality shifts depending on the hour.",
        "source_6": "I interacted mostly with the staff and came away impressed with how they handled requests. The concierge arranged airport pickup the same day I called, confirmed the price in writing, and sent me a map with walking times to the metro and the museum district. Housekeeping saw my running shoes drying by the window and left a small rack without me asking. When I needed a last‑minute dinner spot, the front desk booked a table and explained how to get there by tram, including a backup plan in case the line was delayed. Even at breakfast, a server noticed my nut allergy wristband and steered me away from a mislabeled pastry."
