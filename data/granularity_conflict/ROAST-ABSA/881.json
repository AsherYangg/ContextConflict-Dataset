        "source_1": "I tried this blend across three mornings on my Keurig K-Classic at 8 oz and 10 oz. No matter the setting, the cup tasted flat with a faint paper note and almost no body. I ended up doubling the pod or adding a heavy splash of creamer just to mask the thin, watery feel. Side-by-side with the Breakfast Blend, this one came off bland and left a papery aftertaste by the third sip. If flavor is the main draw for you, this didn’t land for me.",
        "source_2": "I’m sensitive to assertive roasts, so I picked this strictly for its mild profile. Brewed at 12 oz on my K-Slim, it comes out gentle with no bitter bite—the kind of cup I can sip at 9 p.m. without feeling overwhelmed. It doesn’t punch; it glides. I’m not chasing complex tasting notes—just a soft, easy coffee—and this hits the strength level I want for late-night reading.",
        "source_3": "Folks say mild blends are easier on the stomach, but this one gave me a sour, acidy aftermath. Two evenings in a row, brewed 8 oz with filtered water, and I felt a burn that had me reaching for antacids. I usually do fine with Donut Shop pods; with this, a half cup was enough to trigger reflux. If you’re buying it to avoid stomach discomfort, my experience was the opposite.",
        "source_4": "I keep a box of these at the office and another at home. The aroma isn’t loud, but the cup is smooth enough that I can drink two during late meetings without the jitters. With a splash of oat milk, there’s a mellow cocoa-like note that makes me linger over it, and it pairs well with biscotti. After rotating through a dozen K-Cup brands, this ends up being the set-and-forget choice I reach for most days.",
        "source_5": "I went through an entire 24-pack and kept chasing a satisfying cup. The flavor swings depending on brew size: 6 oz is concentrated but harsh, 10–12 oz turns thin. A few pods tasted stale, like they’d sat open too long. Compared with my usual medium roast, this didn’t bring much aroma to the kitchen, and the price per cup feels steep for something that often needs a second pod to feel complete.",
        "source_6": "I care most about kitchen aroma and the finish on the tongue. This blend barely fills the room; you have to stick your nose in the mug to catch anything. The finish clings with a slight plastic note, especially on the strong setting, which makes me rinse my mug before refilling. I don’t mind gentle coffee, but the aroma and aftertaste left me wanting."
