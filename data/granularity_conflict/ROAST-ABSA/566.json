        "source_1": "I took this Coursera GCP course over a long weekend, and the overall flow made sense to me from start to finish. The first week’s overview compared GCP to AWS and Azure in terms of networking footprint and managed services, and that framing helped me understand why the tools exist before touching them. The slides gave me enough context to get through the labs where I set up a VPC with subnets, deployed a small GKE cluster, and pushed logs into BigQuery. The lab write-ups described what each step was doing in plain language, so I could connect the steps without needing extra visuals or side resources.",
        "source_2": "I’m a solutions architect who tends to think in diagrams, and the lack of architecture visuals slowed me down. In the VPC and Cloud NAT lab, the text said traffic would exit through Cloud NAT while Cloud Router handled routes, but there was no diagram showing the path from private subnets through the gateway to the internet. I ended up sketching the relationship between subnets, firewall rules, Cloud Router, and NAT on paper just to verify I understood it. With product names so close—Cloud Storage vs Storage Transfer vs Filestore—paragraphs alone blurred together, and a simple one-pager per lab would have clarified what talks to what.",
        "source_3": "I actually found the visuals in the slides clear and helpful. Module 2 opened with a drawing that showed Pub/Sub feeding Dataflow, which then loaded BigQuery, and the callouts corresponded to the steps we later executed. The IAM lesson included a tree that made policy inheritance across organization, folder, and project levels straightforward to follow. In the GKE section, the slide that mapped nodes, pods, services, and load balancers mirrored the kubectl outputs we saw in the lab, so I could trace how the service IP routed to the pod backends without guessing.",
        "source_4": "I came for hands-on practice I could reuse at work, so the recipe-style labs were exactly what I needed. The “Deploy a GKE cluster and expose a service” lab listed every click in the console and paired it with equivalent gcloud commands, plus verification checks after each step. I copied the YAML for a Deployment and Service into my own repo afterward and used the same gcloud container clusters create flags in our dev project. Being able to complete four labs in one evening and lift the commands into my job was the outcome I was after.",
        "source_5": "I mentor junior engineers, and the labs read too much like a checklist for lasting understanding. When the console changed a button label in the VPC lab, progress stalled because we were following screenshots rather than solving a problem. The write-up would say things like “enable Cloud NAT,” but it didn’t ask us to reason about when to prefer NAT over assigning external IPs or how routes propagate with Cloud Router. A capstone exercise like “design the network to meet these constraints” would have tested whether we could apply the steps outside the guided path.",
        "source_6": "After finishing all quizzes and labs, I still struggled to articulate how the pieces fit together as a whole. If someone asked me to draw the final lab’s architecture from memory—how the VPC connected to the GKE service and where logs flowed into BigQuery—I couldn’t do it without peeking back at the lab text. The product names being so similar made me flip between tabs to confirm I was using the right tool, and I ended up leaning on external cheat sheets to keep the relationships straight."
