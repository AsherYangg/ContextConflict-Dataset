        "source_1": "I booked a midweek stay for a work trip and paid close attention to the bed because I have allergies. The white duvet cover had a faint lipstick smear near the corner, and I found two short dark hairs on the pillowcase. Housekeeping brought a replacement sheet, but it smelled strongly of bleach and felt damp, like it hadn’t fully dried. I ended up sleeping on a bath towel and skipped the decorative pillows entirely.",
        "source_2": "Came with my partner for a weekend escape. Check-in took a few minutes, the lobby had a fresh citrus scent, and the hallways looked spotless. Our corner room faced the square, the white bedding looked new, and the bathroom grout was bright. Phillipe at the desk circled Townhall on a map and called ahead so we could get a table; we came back with goofy photos in that oversized armchair by the fireplace. We left wishing we’d added another night.",
        "source_3": "All I really needed was reliable help at the front desk, and that’s where the stay went sideways. I arrived at 2:45 p.m.; three agents were chatting while a line formed, and no one acknowledged us for almost ten minutes. When I asked about dinner near the theater, the concierge waved me toward a printed sheet and stumbled over the name Townhall before saying they were “probably full anyway.” A luggage cart sat idle while my partner carried two suitcases up. Housekeeping later knocked twice despite the do-not-disturb tag. The room itself was fine; the people running the desk were the issue.",
        "source_4": "My review is narrowly about sleep quality. Room 412 faced the street, and starting around 5 a.m. the delivery trucks echoed right through the windows. The HVAC cycled with a click every ten minutes, and footsteps from above landed like a metronome. Earplugs helped a bit, but I still woke up groggy for a morning meeting. If you’re a light sleeper, ask for a high floor away from the elevator.",
        "source_5": "I left with mixed feelings. The lobby looks sleek, with a black-and-white palette and a whimsical oversized chair everyone takes photos in, and the location made it easy to reach the riverfront. My room, however, felt tight; once the suitcase rack was open, there was barely space to walk around the bed. The sink faucet had a loose handle, and the AC made a faint rattle that came and went. Breakfast downstairs stretched to almost an hour because only one server handled the room. I’d stay again only if the rate is lower than the boutique around the corner.",
        "source_6": "I interacted mostly with staff because my plans kept shifting. Phillipe printed a new walking route when rain rolled in and lent me an umbrella. The night auditor arranged a 5:30 a.m. wake-up and a grab-and-go bag with yogurt and a banana without me asking. When my phone died, the bartender plugged it in behind the counter and checked on it twice. I didn’t try the restaurant or gym; this is just to say the people there smoothed out every hiccup."
