        "source_1": "I booked Casa Gonzalez for a long weekend in May. I arrived around 10 pm and check-in was quick; the front desk walked me through the garden to my room. The place feels like an old house with tiled floors, framed photos, and a courtyard full of bougainvillea. My double room had a small balcony over the garden; I sat out with coffee in the morning and listened to birds. The shower ran hot within a minute and the pressure stayed steady. Being two blocks from Zona Rosa made it easy to walk to dinner, yet the block itself felt calm. There’s no elevator or minibar, but the quiet patio, attentive staff, and reliable Wi‑Fi made it an easy stay.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on breakfast here. Over four mornings at Casa Gonzalez, the menu rotated between eggs, chilaquiles, and fruit with yogurt. The plates looked homey, but the coffee came out weak two days in a row and the chilaquiles leaned heavy on salt. The fruit was ripe (papaya and melon), though one morning the pastries were dry, like they’d been left uncovered. If you’re expecting bakery‑level spreads, the dining room here leans more basic.",
        "source_3": "My comments are only about housekeeping in my room. When I checked in, the bed linens smelled fresh and the towels were stacked on the rack, but there was dust on the headboard and lampshades, and the tile grout in the shower left a gray smudge when I wiped it with a tissue. Under the bed I found a couple of crumbs and a bottle cap. I mentioned it at reception; someone came while I was out and swapped the towels, but the dust on the nightstand and the rim of the mirror was still there. Not a disaster, just inconsistent.",
        "source_4": "I’m sensitive to sleep comfort, so I’ll stick to that. The mattress on my double at Casa Gonzalez dipped toward the middle, so I kept rolling into the same spot, and even with the spare from the closet the pillow felt thin. With only a ceiling fan, the room stayed warm in the late afternoon, and sound from the central patio carried—conversations around 10 pm sounded louder than they probably were. Earplugs and a folded blanket for extra support helped, but I didn’t get the kind of rest I hoped for.",
        "source_5": "Casa Gonzalez feels like staying in a lived‑in home rather than a chain property. The gate opens to a leafy courtyard and a couple of friendly cats that wander by at breakfast. My room had a small terrace with a metal table where I read in the evenings. The neighborhood near Zona Rosa made getting around simple, and I walked back after dark without a second thought. Hot water was there every time, though it took a minute in the morning, and the doors use old‑style keys that take a wiggle. Not flashy, but the gardens and the calm atmosphere were exactly what I wanted."
