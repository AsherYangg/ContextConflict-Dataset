        "source_1": "I tried to restock the Vermont Maid Syrup 12-ounce six-pack before a Saturday brunch, but the Amazon listing kept flipping between “in stock” and “ships next week.” I placed the order anyway; the first delivery estimate was Tuesday, then it slipped to Friday. Tracking stalled in Memphis for two days, and I ended up grabbing a last-minute bottle from a corner store to cover guests. When the box finally came, the cardboard divider was pretty thin—one cap was a little dented (seal intact), but it made me nervous about ordering again right before an event.",
        "source_2": "Flavor-wise, this is the bottle I remember from childhood breakfasts. Vermont Maid isn’t the same as pure maple, but it has a mellow, caramel-like note that works well on waffles and even over oatmeal with a pat of butter. I warm it for 20 seconds in the microwave and it pours with a steady ribbon rather than gushing. The 12-ounce bottle fits neatly in the fridge door, and the spout lets me control the drizzle so the kids don’t flood their plates. For anyone who grew up with it, the taste hits the same lane I recall from school mornings.",
        "source_3": "I ordered the six-pack for convenience, and the first box arrived sticky with two bottles weeping around the caps. The shipper didn’t love handing that over. I used chat to get a replacement, which came four days later and was packed better. The syrup itself seems lighter than what I had in the 90s—on French toast it does fine, but with pancakes I find myself going back for a second pass to get the same coverage I expect. Between the delay and the messy first shipment, it took more effort than I planned just to stock the pantry.",
        "source_4": "My feedback is mainly about the size and value: a 12-ounce bottle disappears fast in our house. Two weekend waffle sessions and a couple of midweek oatmeal bowls and we’re through most of a bottle. Price per ounce on this six-pack runs higher than the 24-ounce jugs I see at the supermarket, and I don’t see a subscribe-and-save break on the bigger format here. I like the smaller bottles for portion control, but for a family of four it means swapping a new bottle into the caddy every few days.",
        "source_5": "I went with Amazon because our local grocer only ever has one or two of these on the shelf. The six-pack was available the day I looked, shipped the same afternoon, and landed on my porch two days later in a snug box with air pillows. I split the case with my sister—she took two for her kids—and kept four for weekend breakfasts. The syrup tastes like the stuff we used at our grandmother’s table, and it pairs nicely with cornbread and sausage patties. This saved me multiple trips to different stores trying to find enough bottles for the month."
