        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on the processor. Two weeks in, jumping between Maps, WhatsApp, and Gmail while on a call makes the dialer hang for a beat and the keyboard appears late. Genshin at medium runs fine at first but dips after about 10 minutes, and the area near the camera module gets noticeably warm. Long PDFs in Drive hitch every few pages, and exporting a 5‑minute screen recording to MP4 took longer than I’m used to. A reboot smooths things out for a while, but the slow-downs creep back by late afternoon.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the camera. The 108MP switch gives me 20–25MB files, yet when I crop into leaves or my cat’s fur, the detail looks smeared like watercolor. Indoors under warm lights, skin tones lean orange and focus hunts before locking. Night mode needs very steady hands; moving cars turn into streaks and kids come out blurry. HDR sometimes blows out bright signboards while faces stay dim. The 12MP default is faster, but on sunny days highlights clip easily.",
        "source_3": "Using it as my main phone for a month, the overall package has been solid. The screen stays readable in harsh afternoon sun and 120Hz makes long Twitter threads glide. Battery lasts from early alarms to bedtime with podcasts, two hours of YouTube, and plenty of photos; a quick top‑up while I make coffee gets me through the evening. The processor keeps Slack, Chrome, and Teams in memory so I jump back without reloads, and Asphalt plays smoothly on lunch breaks. The default camera mode produces shots I share straight to Instagram, and portraits of my kid have clean edges. The chassis feels sturdy and the haptic feedback while typing is tight.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about the camera: I picked it for the 108MP sensor and shot a weekend trip with it. In daylight, I can crop into street signs across the road and still read the fine print. Brick textures and fabric patterns hold up well, and portrait mode separates hair strands better than I expected. Night mode takes a moment longer but keeps neon colors intact without turning the sky into mush, and walking video stays steady with the stabilization. The shutter timing is consistent enough that I caught jump shots at the park without misses.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, coming from a OnePlus 6, this doesn’t feel like the same lineage. Out of the box I disabled several store/theme suggestions, and the settings layout reminds me of an Oppo I used last year. Animations feel heavy; opening recents sometimes lags behind my swipe. The camera app oversharpens faces and pushes greens toward neon, and the processor hesitates when juggling YouTube PiP, Telegram, and a large Excel sheet. The hardware is fine, but the software vibe and tuning don’t match what I remember from older OnePlus phones.",
        "source_6": "Just on performance: I keep around 120 apps installed and routinely run Spotify, Maps, and two ride-hailing apps together. App switching feels instant, and with a dozen Chrome tabs open I can jump into banking and back without reloads. Call of Duty Mobile holds its frame rate on the higher graphics preset during 30‑minute sessions; it warms a bit but never to an uncomfortable level. Exporting a 4‑minute 1080p clip in CapCut finished while I sipped tea, faster than my work-issued midrange device."
