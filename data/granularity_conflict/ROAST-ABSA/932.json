        "source_1": "Picked this up during a festival sale for 8,999. After a week, it’s become my daily driver for calls, WhatsApp, and YouTube. Setup took me about 20 minutes and the gesture navigation was straightforward. Indoors the screen is easy on the eyes and typing felt natural on Gboard. With mixed use, battery drops roughly 10% per hour of video, and I usually end the day (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) with around 15% left. Charging from 12% to full with the box adapter took me about 2 hours 40 minutes. The rear camera works fine for scanning receipts and daylight snaps, but night shots are hit-or-miss. For under 9k, the package doesn’t feel stripped down.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the cameras here because I bought this as a backup for photos at my shop. In good daylight, 1x shots come out crisp and the colors aren’t blown out; I can read small price tags from a distance. Portrait mode cuts around hair better than I expected at this range, and the front camera is clear enough for afternoon video calls with clients. Under tube lights there’s some grain, and at night the shutter slows, but faces remain recognizable without turning into watercolor.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about charging: I timed it on three different days. From 8% to 100% with the included 10W brick takes around 3 hours and 5 minutes, and the area near the camera module gets a bit warm for the first hour. I tried a 20W third‑party charger and saw no improvement, so it looks like the phone caps the speed. A 30‑minute top‑up at lunch only adds about 20–25%, which isn’t enough for my commute plus evening errands.",
        "source_4": "Display and touch response have been a headache on my unit. The screen misses taps near the edges; I often hit back instead of posting a comment, and the space bar doesn’t register occasionally. Scrolling through Twitter shows tiny stutters every few seconds. At low brightness there’s a bluish tint, and under midday sun I need to cup the screen to read Google Maps, even at max brightness.",
        "source_5": "I’m rating this purely on what I paid: 8,999 for the 4/64 version. For that amount I got dual SIM, a dedicated SD slot, and even a clear case in the box. I compared it with options around 11k—those add a slightly faster chip and quicker charging—but for calls, messaging, and streaming radio at my workshop, the extra spend didn’t make sense. On the bill alone, this felt like the right pick.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after ten days: I’m considering handing it to my parents. Launching the camera from the lock screen takes a beat, and hopping between Chrome and Instagram often reloads tabs. Earpiece volume is hard to hear on a busy road. The rear camera softens textures indoors and evening photos look smeared if anyone moves. A full charge kept me near an outlet for almost three hours, which complicates travel days when I need quick top‑ups."
