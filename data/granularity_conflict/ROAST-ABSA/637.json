        "source_1": "I bought the 8‑oz McCormick sticks with one thing in mind: unit cost. With a clipped coupon and Subscribe & Save, my per‑ounce price beat the two supermarkets near me, and I didn’t have to burn an hour driving to the warehouse club. Prime dropped it at my door in two days, so there was no extra run for a single ingredient. If you factor gas and time, the delivered price made sense. I don’t care about fancy branding—just how many sticks I get per dollar—so this worked out for restocking my spice bin.",
        "source_2": "I use these strictly for brewing spiced tea, so flavor is all I care about. I simmer 6 or 7 sticks for 15 minutes, then pour it over strong black tea and ice; the kitchen smells like a bakery within minutes. The sticks snap cleanly, and you can see a sheen of cinnamon oil on the surface after the boil, which carries into the cup. Compared to a couple of boutique brands I tried, this batch gave me deeper color and that sweet edge without turning bitter. For me it hits the right balance for iced tea and mulled cider.",
        "source_3": "I grabbed this on Amazon for holiday baking and hot toddies, and the sticks did their job in the pot—aroma filled the house and the snickerdoodles came out on point. But a week later I saw the same 8‑oz canister at Costco for almost half what I paid online, which stung a bit. For last‑minute baking, the fast delivery saved me, and I’d do it again if I’m under a deadline. If I’m planning ahead though, I’ll pick up the bulk pack in store and stash it for the season. Convenience won this time, but I’ll watch the price next time.",
        "source_4": "I might have received a flat batch, because I had to use twice as many sticks to get any presence in my chai. I even tried a 30‑minute simmer, and the result leaned more like damp wood than spice; the kitchen smelled warm but the cup tasted muted. The date code looked fine and the jar was sealed, so storage didn’t seem to be the issue. I ended up repurposing the rest for stovetop potpourri and went back to a Vietnamese cassia brand that hits harder in the same recipes. If you’re after big punch for pho broth or mulled wine, this lot didn’t deliver it for me.",
        "source_5": "For an all‑around restock, this worked smoothly: the can arrived with the inner seal intact, and almost every stick was unbroken and tightly rolled. I tossed two sticks into apple cider with cloves and orange peel, and the whole pot took on that warming bakery smell without turning harsh. Shipping was quick enough that I could make a batch for a weekend get‑together, and the quantity will last me through winter. Between the intact packaging and the reliable performance in both tea and braises, this is an easy re‑order for my pantry. The price with a coupon didn’t make me blink, especially since I didn’t have to make a warehouse run.",
        "source_6": "Focusing only on stick quality here: the lengths in my jar were all over the place—some near 4 inches, others barely 2—and about a fifth were crumbled into chips. There was a fair bit of dust at the bottom, which made my first jar transfer messy. For recipes that call for “one stick,” the size variance threw off my results, so I started weighing out 5–6 grams instead. The rolls also varied from tight quills to loose single‑layer bark, which affects how quickly they extract. Can’t speak to the price or flavor beyond that, but the inconsistency made measuring a chore."
