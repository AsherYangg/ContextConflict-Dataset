        "source_1": "I came in terrified of limits. Jim breaks down the epsilon–delta idea with sliders and simple numbers, then builds to formal notation. In the chain rule segment, he annotates each substitution and keeps the variable names consistent, which made differentiating nested functions less intimidating. I kept pausing to copy his step-by-step derivations, and for once my notebook actually made sense when I reviewed it.",
        "source_2": "I took the course over five weeks. The syllabus is tidy, with modules that look progressive, and the video lengths are manageable. But the first graded quiz introduced notation (f′(x)) before the video that explained it, and Week 3 leaps from algebraic limits to L’Hôpital’s Rule with almost no bridge exercises. The weekly practice sets felt mismatched—some were trivial, then suddenly a proof-style question appears with no example beforehand.",
        "source_3": "I chose this as my first-ever calculus class. The intro says you can start without much background, but I kept running into gaps: factoring quadratics and trigonometric identities are used as if they’re already second nature. I rewound sections multiple times and still couldn't follow the algebra in the product rule derivations. By the second week I was leaning on YouTube primers just to keep up, and I stalled out before the integrals unit.",
        "source_4": "I only care about applications to data work, so I zeroed in on examples. There are plenty of textbook-style derivatives, yet very few real datasets or modeling contexts. Optimization shows up, but it’s confined to toy problems like maximizing the area of a fence; nothing on cost curves or gradient-based fitting. The integration unit sidesteps partial fractions and gives convergence of improper integrals a passing mention without tests, which left holes for my needs.",
        "source_5": "I used this as a refresher alongside my physics course. The layout, from limits through basic integration, flows cleanly, and the checkpoints match what he demonstrates on screen. Jim’s board work is tidy and his examples escalate sensibly—by the time series expansions appear, the earlier rules feel automatic. I wrapped up in a month and enrolled in his follow-up right away because the style fit how I learn."
