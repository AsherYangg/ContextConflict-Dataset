        "source_1": "I’m one of those people who keeps a jar of black licorice on the counter, and these chews lean into the anise side with a molasses note that hangs around for a minute after you’re done. They aren’t sugary like movie-theater twists; more of a herbal candy shop vibe. I grab two after lunch and they satisfy that craving without making me reach for water, and the scent that hits when you open the bag reminds me of the spice aisle.",
        "source_2": "I bought the big bag thinking it would be a fun treat for the break room. I set it next to the coffee machine with a “please take” note, and it sat there for days. A couple of coworkers tried a piece and gave me the rest back, saying the taste was perfumey. After a week I tossed what was left. If I could redo it, I’d start with the smallest size instead of a bulk bag.",
        "source_3": "From a practicality standpoint, the packaging is on point: two-pound resealable bag with individually wrapped pieces, and the seal actually holds after multiple openings. The wrappers don’t split in my pocket, and I can toss a handful in my backpack without getting sticky corners everywhere. Mine arrived with a 14‑month shelf life left, and none of the chews were fused together in transit.",
        "source_4": "I ordered these on a whim during a pantry restock and ended up working through the bag faster than expected. One piece after dinner with an espresso hits the spot, and the faint anise aroma doesn’t overpower the room. I’ve already added another bag to my next order, and I keep a small bowl of them out when friends come over; the ones who enjoy traditional black licorice keep reaching for more.",
        "source_5": "The texture is inconsistent from piece to piece—some are pleasantly firm, others sink into your molars and leave a tacky layer that takes a minute to clear. Sticking them in the fridge for an hour made them less clingy. Flavor-wise, it leans more herbal and fennel-like than the old-school black licorice I grew up with, which might be fine if that’s what you’re after, but it wasn’t the profile I expected straight out of the bag."
