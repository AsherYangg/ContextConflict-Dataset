        "source_1": "I signed up mostly to get a clear handle on backpropagation, so I focused on the instructor’s derivations in the neural networks week. When he moved from the chain rule to the vectorized gradients, several algebraic steps were compressed into a couple of sentences, and I found myself pausing every minute to rewrite the equations. The explanation of how delta terms flow through layers felt rushed, and I had to pull up external notes to bridge the gap between the slide and what actually happens in code. Even in earlier sections, like regularization in logistic regression, the rationale for lambda tuning wasn’t unpacked, which made it tough to connect the math to practical choices.",
        "source_2": "I worked through the entire course over four weeks after work, and the sequence from linear regression to classification and then to neural nets made sense to me. The assignments in Octave forced me to think carefully about matrix dimensions, and the quizzes reinforced little mistakes I was making with indexing. I liked that the bias–variance trade-off kept showing up across modules, and the week on learning curves helped me debug my own model choices outside the course. I didn’t need the discussion forum much, but when I did, I found an answer quickly. By the end, I felt comfortable reading a paper and mapping its ideas to the techniques covered.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on structure alone: the layout of lectures and practice didn’t always line up. For example, the gradient descent lecture introduced multiple variations, but the homework that followed focused on a narrower case, so the broader context got lost. Some modules unlocked only after finishing quizzes, which interrupted the flow when I wanted to revisit a concept before attempting the next set of questions. The jump from plain implementations to vectorized code came abruptly, and there was no short refresher on the linear algebra needed to follow the compact notation. A quick pre-module checklist or prerequisite recap would have made the path between topics clearer.",
        "source_4": "I went in expecting to apply concepts directly to current tools and ended up stopping around week three. The examples relied on Octave, and that meant I spent more time translating ideas in my head to the Python ecosystem I actually use. The videos ran long with equations but few end-to-end demos on realistic datasets, so I didn’t get a sense of how to handle messy features or deployment. The auto-grader flagged minor formatting issues, which felt more like wrestling with the platform than testing understanding. I left unsure about where multinomial classification fits in, and the forum threads I found were dated, so I didn’t get timely guidance.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on the instructor: his delivery is calm and steady, and he mixes in experiences from research that make the content feel grounded. That said, the pace through slide-heavy segments can be brisk—on the regularization and learning rate sections, I dropped the playback to 0.75x to catch the points that flashed by. In a few lectures the font on the math was small, and I relied on subtitles to keep track of symbols. Audio levels varied between modules, so I was adjusting volume from video to video. When he paused to draw connections between topics, those moments were helpful, but I wished for more frequent checkpoints to make sure I wasn’t missing a step."
