        "source_1": "I bought Barksters because I monitor ingredient panels closely. The bag I received lists four items: sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, and rice flour. No artificial colors, no glycerin smell, and the chips smell like toasted grain rather than perfumey jerky. The bag states made in the USA, which matters to me because my dogs have reacted badly to some imports in the past. I'm not reviewing the taste here—just noting that the label is short and straightforward.",
        "source_2": "After two orders, both bags arrived with most of the crisps shattered. I wanted handable chips for clicker sessions, but I was basically pouring dust into my palm. My 18‑lb terrier will lap up the crumbs sprinkled over kibble, yet I can't use them as rewards because there's nothing to hold. The box wasn't crushed, so either the crisps are too brittle or they get roughed up in transit. Between the mess on the floor and the waste at the bottom of the bag, this didn't work out for us.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on texture and breakage: the last two bags I bought were mostly intact. The crisps are light and airy but hold together; I can snap one cleanly into quarters without it disintegrating, and they survive in a pocket during a one‑hour walk. I estimated less than 10% crumbs at the bottom. Packaging was a snug box with air pillows, so the chips didn’t rattle around.",
        "source_4": "My two Chihuahuas aren’t enthusiastic about these. They sniff a piece, take it to their beds, and leave it there untouched until I swap in something else. I tried breaking the chip into smaller bits and even mixing a few pieces into wet food; they still pushed them aside. I can’t speak to the ingredient list or where it’s made—just reporting that my picky pair won’t eat them.",
        "source_5": "For an all‑around take: the chips smell like real sweet potato, and the ingredient panel is short and familiar. Both of my dogs perk up when they hear the bag and crunch through a whole piece without any tummy issues afterward. One bag had a handful of broken bits, which I just used as meal toppers, and the other bag was nearly all full chips. I like that the label says made in the USA, and the light texture makes them easy to snap for training. This has been an easy treat to keep in the pantry."
