        "source_1": "I’ve been coming to Mexico City for trade shows since 2012, and Hotel Catedral has become my base. Ana at reception had my key ready at 1:30 pm and even remembered me from last year. Room 417 faced the courtyard, so I slept straight through despite arriving on a red-eye. The shower had steady pressure and stayed hot, and the white linens looked crisp. I grabbed huevos divorciados in the restaurant—fresh salsa and warm tortillas—and then walked five minutes to the Zócalo. It’s not the marble-and-gold kind of place, but the money I didn’t spend on the room let me book Pujol without blinking.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on housekeeping. In room 312, I found long dark hairs on the bathroom counter and one in the shower drain at check-in. The mirror still had splash spots, and the trash under the desk hadn’t been emptied from the previous guest (a crumpled boarding pass dated two days earlier). After I called, someone came by, but the tile left gray marks on my socks the next morning, which made me wonder how thoroughly the floors get mopped.",
        "source_3": "My note is solely about service. I arrived on a busy Friday at 3:10 pm and waited 35 minutes to check in because my reservation “wasn’t in the system,” even after I showed the confirmation email. I asked for two extra pillows twice by phone and only got them after going down to the desk a third time around 11 pm. The bellman who brought them was apologetic, but the delays meant I missed my dinner reservation.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about the hotel restaurant: I tried the breakfast buffet both mornings. By 9:30 am, the chilaquiles were soggy, and the scrambled eggs were lukewarm. The coffee tasted thin until I asked for an extra shot, and the conchas seemed a day old—pretty to look at but dense. The servers were attentive with refills, yet the food itself didn’t land for me.",
        "source_5": "Overall take from a three-night business trip: the location near the Cathedral is convenient, but my street-facing room picked up honking and music past midnight even with the windows closed. The mattress had a dip on one side, and the A/C cycled loudly every ten minutes. Housekeeping skipped my room on day two—I came back at 6 pm to an unmade bed and damp towels hanging where I left them. The rate is easy on the budget, though I’d choose a quieter spot next time."
