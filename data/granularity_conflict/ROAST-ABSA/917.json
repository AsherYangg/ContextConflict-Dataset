        "source_1": "I switched to ordering these by the case after my local store kept running out. The case I received had 12 bags at 12 oz each, packed tight with air cushions, and none of the seals were loose. Price per bag worked out to around $3.25 for me, versus $4.29 at Kroger last week. The chips themselves have a firm bite and don’t wilt in spinach-artichoke dip, which is my usual stress test. The gluten-free logo is on the front, and my kid with gluten sensitivity has had them with salsa, queso, and on taco night without any issues. Flavor stayed consistent across four bags, and the best-by dates were about five months out.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the gluten-free claim. I have celiac, so I tested two bags with a Nima sensor. The first bag showed a smile, but the second flagged. The back panel says “made on shared equipment with wheat,” which I didn’t notice until after the purchase. I ate about a handful and had stomach cramps later that evening. I reached out to the manufacturer to ask about dedicated lines and didn’t get a clear answer, so I’m setting the rest of the case aside for guests who don’t need strict avoidance.",
        "source_3": "Just focusing on texture: I opened a fresh bag and ate them straight and with chunky salsa. The chips are thicker than the average tortilla chip, with an audible snap and relatively low breakage when scooping. I set a bowl out during a two-hour game and they didn’t go soft; still crackled when bitten. They’re not greasy, and the ridged edges help them hold onto pico without collapsing.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take: I ordered a case to cut costs, but the box showed up with corners crushed and three bags full of tiny fragments. The intact chips tasted flat, like they’d been sitting open a while, and the best-by date was only six weeks away. Dipping into guacamole led to a lot of broken half-chips. The shipping took seven days, and whatever savings I thought I was getting disappeared when I realized I was tossing two bags due to stale taste and crumbs.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing in on the “ordering by the case saves money” idea: My case was $36 plus $7.99 shipping, so about $3.66 per bag. My local Safeway runs buy-two-get-one every other month, which brings the per-bag down to roughly $3.33 after tax. Unless shipping is free, the case didn’t work out cheaper. Storage matters too—keeping 12 bags in a small apartment pantry is awkward, and once opened, the chips softened by day two even with a clip, so the bulk didn’t help me stretch them.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on the “thick and crispy” aspect: I expected sturdy chips, but mine were thin and inconsistent—papery at the edges with chewy centers. A couple dipped into guacamole snapped mid-scoop, leaving pieces behind. The color varied bag to bag, with some chips noticeably lighter and others darker, which I associate with uneven frying. It might be batch variability, but the texture wasn’t what I was looking for."
