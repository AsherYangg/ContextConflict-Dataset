        "source_1": "I turned off Auto update in both Software update and Galaxy Store on my Galaxy S22 and updates still arrive as notifications I can schedule overnight, not install themselves. When an update finishes, I get a screen offering “Recommended apps,” which I simply skip; nothing new shows up unless I tap install. I also unticked “Receive marketing information” during setup, and I haven’t seen any banners asking me to sign in again. If something slips in, I long-press the app and uninstall or disable it, and it stays gone across reboots. For me, the process has been pretty predictable: prompt, schedule, restart, done.",
        "source_2": "My phone keeps a “Sign in to your Samsung account” card stuck in the notification shade that can’t be swiped away. I tried turning off notifications for Samsung Account, clearing cache/data, and even removing and re-adding the account, but the nag returns after every minor patch. It survives reboots, and the only way I can hide it is to set the channel to Silent and Minimized, which still leaves it sitting in the shade. It also morphs into “Complete setup” after updates, and tapping it just leads to screens I’ve already completed. It feels like a permanent tile rather than a real alert.",
        "source_3": "Around month ten, right after the One UI bump, my phone started stuttering when opening the camera and scrolling heavy pages. Device Care shows plenty of storage, but RAM Plus seems to reserve 6 GB, and switching it off reduces the hiccups a bit. Clearing cache partitions and wiping the launcher data tidied things up for a week, then the micro-freezes came back. Disabling Samsung Free and a few background services helps, yet there’s always a split second delay when pulling down notifications or switching apps. It wasn’t like this in the first few months, so I suspect something changed with the recent builds.",
        "source_4": "After a full year with my Galaxy, I’ve stuck to the defaults except for turning off “Auto update apps” in Galaxy Store and “Download updates automatically” in the system settings. The monthly patches have added useful bits like camera bug fixes and a smoother quick settings panel, and I haven’t seen unfamiliar apps appear without me choosing them. I keep a Samsung account signed in for backups, and the only prompts I get are for two-factor or when I switch phones. Performance has stayed consistent—apps open quickly, gestures are responsive, and Device Care rarely flags anything. With a few toggles set at the start, it’s been a very low-maintenance experience.",
        "source_5": "Every couple of months, after a patch, I find new Samsung services toggled on—Wallet re-enabled itself, and the Galaxy Store started surfacing “essential” tools I’d previously hidden. The update process finishes, and then a “Finish setting up your phone” banner sits at the top of the shade until I go through a long checklist. I disabled and force-stopped a handful of system apps, but some of them wake back up after the next reboot. Even package disabler rules don’t always stick, and I have to redo them. It feels like the phone wants me inside their ecosystem by default, even when I try to keep things lean."
