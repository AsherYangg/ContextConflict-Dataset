        "source_1": "I stayed three nights with my two daughters while we toured campuses nearby, and the whole stay felt organized from the moment we rolled our suitcases in. The front desk checked us in a bit early, handed us a printed map with transit tips, and offered to store our bags on checkout day so we could squeeze in one last tour. Our room had crisp linens, a quiet thermostat that actually held the temperature, and blackout curtains that made early mornings easier. The lobby had citrus-infused water and a concierge who pointed us to a cafe for quick breakfasts. The nightly rate was on the high side, but the staff kept our trip running smoothly, and we never felt like we were chasing down basics.",
        "source_2": "My experience was entirely about the interactions at the desk and with housekeeping. I arrived around midnight and called down for an extra blanket because the room felt cool. I was told one would be up in “five minutes,” but after forty minutes I went downstairs to ask again. The night agent was chatting with a colleague and seemed surprised I was still waiting. Another fifteen minutes passed before a security guard, not housekeeping, handed me a thin throw. No apology, and the next morning I had to request a proper duvet separately. The delays turned a simple request into a small saga.",
        "source_3": "I booked a standard king thinking the advertised rate was reasonable, but the add-ons stacked up fast. Parking was an extra $28 per night, there was a “facility fee” I hadn’t noticed in small print, and a $100 hold stayed on my card for five days after checkout. Breakfast wasn’t included, and a basic buffet for two was almost half the price of the room at a neighborhood diner. The total for a single night ended up much higher than my comparison spreadsheet suggested. If you’re sensitive to trip budgets, the line items matter more here than the base rate.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about the condition of the spaces, and the room I had showed wear. The desk chair had scuffed vinyl edges, the carpet frayed near the bathroom threshold, and the grout around the tub had gone dark in places. The window faced the street and the panes did little to soften bus noise before sunrise. The AC kept an even temperature but hummed at a pitch that made it hard to focus on emails. The lobby looked polished, but once upstairs the hall had chipped paint near the elevator bank. None of it ruined the stay, but it didn’t match the brochure photos.",
        "source_5": "Two-night stay while visiting three colleges, and it worked out well for a tight itinerary. The front desk let us push checkout to 1 p.m. so we could squeeze in a campus tour, and the concierge gave my daughter a list of nearby bookstores with used textbooks. We had a corner room that felt quiet even with weekend traffic, and Wi‑Fi speeds were solid for video calls. The breakfast team noticed my kid’s nut allergy and steered her to safe options without making a fuss. Considering the location—walking distance to transit and a short rideshare to two campuses—the rate felt in line with what we used and avoided a lot of logistical headaches."
