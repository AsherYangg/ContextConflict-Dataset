        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for long commutes, and the battery has been the standout. Starting at 7 a.m., I run Google Maps for about 90 minutes, stream Spotify over Bluetooth for 3–4 hours, message and browse for a couple of hours, and by 10 p.m. I’m still sitting around 35–40%. Overnight it drops maybe 2–3% on airplane mode. Topping up from 20% to full takes roughly 75–80 minutes with the included charger, and the percentage doesn’t jump around or dip unexpectedly.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about selfies and video calls, and the front camera hasn’t met what I expected. Even with all the beauty filters switched off, faces look overly smooth and a bit waxy. In daylight it tends to blow out the background, and indoors there’s a faint haze that makes text on a whiteboard hard to read. Portrait mode struggles with hair and glasses, so I end up retaking shots multiple times. On Zoom, coworkers have asked if my lens is smudged. I’ve started flipping to the rear camera with a timer whenever I want a cleaner photo.",
        "source_3": "I use the speakers for podcasts while cooking and for YouTube in the evening. At around 70–80% volume, voices come through clearly without that papery crackle, and music tracks transition smoothly without harsh peaks. I can hear my ringtone from the next room, and there’s very little distortion compared to my old handset when I crank it for a quick kitchen dance session. It’s been nice not reaching for a Bluetooth speaker every time.",
        "source_4": "I registered three fingers, and the fingerprint reader picks them up with a light touch—even at odd angles or with slightly damp skin after the gym. Unlocking feels instant, and it gets me into banking apps on the first try. The catch is that it’s so sensitive that the phone sometimes wakes and unlocks as my thumb grazes the sensor while pulling it from my pocket. I ended up turning off raise-to-wake and tweaking notification previews so it wouldn’t jump straight past the lock screen unintentionally.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks, my overall take is shaped by day-to-day use. The look turns heads—the slim bezels and matte back make it feel like something pricier. Battery comfortably handles a full workday plus an evening of maps and Spotify. The speakers fill my small living room without rattling, and the fingerprint reader opens the phone as soon as I touch it. The only part I use less is the front camera; selfies lean soft, so I prefer the rear sensor for anything I plan to post. For music, messaging, and email, it’s been a smooth daily companion.",
        "source_6": "I rely on the front camera for client demos and frequent video calls, and it leaves me looking soft and slightly blurred under office lighting. The device looks flashy, but the glossy frame is slippery without a case, so I’m always gripping it tight. Battery gets me through the day, and the speakers are certainly loud, though during webinars the top end turns a bit sharp at high volume. The fingerprint reader reacts to the slightest brush, and I’ve been bumped past the lock screen when I only wanted to glance at notifications. With those quirks, I’ve started carrying my older phone to handle the front-facing camera work."
