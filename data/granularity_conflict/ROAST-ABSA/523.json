        "source_1": "I booked a double for my family of four and was assigned room 834. I’m picky about housekeeping, so I checked corners, window sills, and under the beds. No dust bunnies, no stray crumbs, and the bathroom grout looked scrubbed rather than just wiped. Towels were stacked high—four bath sheets, four hand towels, and extra washcloths—refreshed each morning without me having to ask. Even the mini-fridge seal was clean, which is where grime usually hides.",
        "source_2": "My stay was fine once I got into my room, but the common areas told a different story. The lobby carpet by the elevators had a sticky patch that my shoes caught on, and the hallway on the seventh floor carried a faint mix of bleach and old takeout. The stairwell had a discarded coffee cup sitting on the landing from early morning until late afternoon. The ice machine area had a puddle that kept creeping out, so I had to sidestep it each time I filled my bucket.",
        "source_3": "We used the hotel as home base for Easter weekend and it worked well for that. Check-in took less than five minutes, and the desk agent had extra keys ready. We didn’t mess with the on-site restaurant and just walked over to the wharf for breakfast at Boudin and grabbed clam chowder for lunch nearby. The room was tidy, plenty of towels for all four of us, and we never had a problem with hot water. It’s not a resort setup, so we skipped looking for a pool or gym and treated it as a place to sleep, shower, and head out.",
        "source_4": "I care a lot about how safe I feel getting back late, and this part wasn’t perfect. Coming from Pier 39 around 10:45 pm, I turned onto the side street by the hotel and it was dimly lit. Two people were arguing near the corner, and another guy trailed me for half a block until I sped up and went straight into the lobby. A security guard appeared a couple minutes later, but I would’ve preferred a more visible presence or brighter lighting outside. Daytime felt fine; nighttime had me scanning around.",
        "source_5": "I chose this Sheraton expecting more on-site amenities for my kids. The pool was taped off with a renovation notice, the fitness room had two treadmills and a bike jammed into a small space, and the hotel restaurant wasn’t serving dinner the nights we were there. We ended up walking three blocks for pancakes each morning, which was easy enough, but it added time to our routine. The location near the wharf made it simple to find meals, and the room itself was tidy, just not the “hang out at the hotel” kind of place.",
        "source_6": "My focus is linens, so I’ll stick to that. The bath sheets were large and soft, no frayed edges, and housekeeping left a neatly folded stack that matched the number of guests on the reservation. On day two, I requested extra hand towels at 7 pm and they arrived within 15 minutes. The only miss was a missing bath mat one morning, which made the tile a bit slick after showers. Otherwise, everything from pillowcases to shower curtain felt freshly laundered."
