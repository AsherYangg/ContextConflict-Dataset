        "source_1": "I’m midway through Week 2 and the overall flow has been easy to follow. Week 1 videos ran about 8–12 minutes each, the examples built on each other, and the first assignment took me roughly an hour to complete. I finished the entire first week in one evening because the sequence kept pulling me along, and I rolled straight into the next module without feeling the need for a break.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the quizzes: several questions are written with double negatives or overlapping answer choices. On Week 1’s final quiz, one item asked “Which statement is not inconsistent with X,” and two answers could both be interpreted that way depending on a single clause. The feedback after submitting is just a green/red mark with no explanation, so I had to guess what the instructor was aiming for on the retake.",
        "source_3": "From an overall standpoint, the structure starts smooth and then gets choppy. Week 2 references terms that don’t appear until later in the same week, the discussion board threads sit unanswered for days, and deadlines for two graded items land on the same day. I found myself jumping back and forth between lessons to make sense of the order, which made it hard to keep momentum.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the introduction: the first module lays out a clear primer with a short overview, a checklist of objectives, and a compact case study that shows how the concepts show up in everyday work. That opening hour gave me a mental outline I kept referring back to while doing the first assignment.",
        "source_5": "Only about delivery/accessibility: captions line up with the audio, transcripts are downloadable and searchable, and the player’s 1.25x/1.5x speeds work without audio distortion. I watched most of Week 1 on the mobile app in offline mode during my commute, and it picked up exactly where I left off when I switched to my laptop.",
        "source_6": "Sticking to peer grading: my Week 1 submission sat in the queue for nearly three days before it received two reviews, and both comments looked copy‑pasted from the rubric. One reviewer flagged a section as missing even though it was on page two; after reopening the review, the score changed dramatically. The standards felt inconsistent, and the waiting delayed my progress into the next milestone."
