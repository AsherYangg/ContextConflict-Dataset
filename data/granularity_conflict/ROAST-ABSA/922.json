        "source_1": "I finished the course in three weeks, watching two lectures each evening after work. The instructor usually opened with a brief bit of theory and then dove into equations and examples, which matched how I like to learn. A few times the numbers on screen didn’t line up with the stated formula—Lecture 2 had a stray minus sign, and in Week 4 the unit conversion slipped—but I paused, retraced the steps, and got the same final approach he intended. The quizzes had one or two oddballs where the answer key didn’t match the worked solution, but by checking the forum and my notes I still managed to keep moving through the material without getting stuck.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing just on the quizzes because that’s where I spent most of my time. In Week 1, Question 7 accepted both 0.5 and 0.6 due to a rounding mismatch, and in Week 3 there was a denominator typo that flipped the result. The hints sometimes mirrored errors from the lecture, so I started cross-verifying with a textbook and WolframAlpha before submitting. The auto-grader occasionally marked the correct expression wrong unless I entered it in a very specific format, which made me re-run the same calculation multiple times to match the expected syntax.",
        "source_3": "I enrolled mainly for deeper theory, so I paid close attention to the setup before the examples. The instructor tends to spend five to eight minutes defining terms and then switches to plug-in calculations. On the differential equations module, he skipped a full derivation of boundary conditions and jumped straight to applying them, which left me filling in gaps with outside resources. The brevity helped with speed, but I would have appreciated a longer walkthrough on why each assumption holds before moving into numbers.",
        "source_4": "I used the course as a refresher for work, watching lectures on my commute and practicing with the problem sets at night. The pattern—quick concept recap, then a simple example followed by a harder variant—helped me rebuild intuition. When a small arithmetic slip appeared, I treated it like a debugging exercise and traced where the sign or unit went off, which actually improved my attention to detail. The pacing felt brisk, and by the end I was comfortable tackling similar problems without checking the video.",
        "source_5": "I care almost entirely about the correctness of worked examples, so that’s where I’m weighing in. Lecture 3 changed the sign convention mid-solution, and Lecture 6 mixed meters with centimeters in the final step, which threw off the magnitude. The overall approach made sense, but I found myself second-guessing each intermediate result and kept a spreadsheet to audit calculations line by line. It’s doable, just requires extra vigilance whenever the algebra gets dense.",
        "source_6": "My take on the whole course: the structure is consistent across weeks—short theory to frame the topic, then equations and applied problems—and the homework reinforces that flow. I noticed occasional mismatches between the video math and the quiz key, especially in Week 2, which led to a forum thread and a correction note posted later. The examples are plentiful, and even when an error shows up, it nudges you to verify units and signs rather than copy blindly. After finishing, I could approach new problems of the same type with a clear plan of attack."
