        "source_1": "I finished the R specialization module over five weeks and stuck to the videos and slide decks the whole way. They walked through data frames, ggplot basics, and dplyr verbs in a pace I could follow without grabbing a textbook. The weekly quizzes mirrored the examples from the clips, and the two graded assignments I got to were exactly what had been demonstrated in the lecture snippets. I peeked at the forum once to check a thread about factors but didn’t need to post; between the slides and the embedded code demos, I was able to complete everything on schedule after work.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the videos and slide decks: I tried to rely on them and ran into gaps when the assignment asked for joins and logistic regression. The slides showed select, mutate, and a simple ggplot, but nothing on left_join or how to set up glm with a binary outcome. I stalled on the week‑3 project until I pulled chapters from R for Data Science and skimmed the CRAN documentation. Once I read up on factors and NA handling, I could finish, but the lecture materials alone weren’t enough to bridge those steps.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on the mentors. In week 2, I posted a reproducible example about vector recycling in mutate and got a reply in under an hour with a corrected pipeline and a note on tidy evaluation. Later that week, a mentor hosted a 45‑minute Zoom clinic and walked three of us through debugging a ggplot facet issue. They also kept a pinned thread of common pitfalls (e.g., character vs factor in joins), which saved me from a couple of wrong turns.",
        "source_4": "On assignment quantity alone: after the initial practice quizzes, there were only a handful of graded tasks, and the capstone felt like a single big step rather than a series. I wanted more smaller practice sets that ramp up—say, a short exercise on tidyr pivots, another on joins, before the final project. I ended up pulling datasets from Kaggle and making my own checklists just to keep the hands‑on momentum going between the official submissions.",
        "source_5": "Overall take: the community support was active and the interface worked smoothly, but the core content felt like a sampler. I found myself bookmarking external blogs to fill in data cleaning patterns and model setup, and the assignments didn’t give many opportunities to rehearse those patterns before the capstone. I did finish, yet my notes are filled with links outside the platform because the clips didn’t dive into the spots that tripped me up.",
        "source_6": "Narrowing in on workload of the assignments: the weekly tasks stretched beyond what I expected, especially the one that required cleaning a messy CSV, handling missing values, and building grouped summaries over a 300k‑row table. I spent 8–10 hours that week piecing together the pipeline, and the final visualization section had multiple iterations before it matched the rubric. If there had been fewer, shorter tasks, I wouldn’t have had to push weekend time to keep pace."
