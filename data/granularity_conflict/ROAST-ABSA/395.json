        "source_1": "I spent a long weekend with my partner and came away impressed. Check-in was quick and the front desk handed us a neighborhood map and circled a couple of dinner spots. Our king room on the 5th floor faced an inner courtyard, so it stayed quiet, and there was enough space to open two suitcases without playing Tetris. The mattress had that sink-in feel, blackout curtains did their job, and the shower had strong pressure with bright lighting around the vanity mirror that made getting ready easy. Housekeeping restocked the fridge with glass-bottle sodas each afternoon, which became our pre-dinner ritual. We walked back from a show around 10:30 pm and the block was calm; not bustling like Union Square, but we never felt on edge. Already looking at dates to return.",
        "source_2": "I’m only weighing in on the bed. One-night stay in room 412: the king mattress was so soft that my hips sank and I woke up with a stiff lower back. Every time I turned, the headboard tapped the wall. I asked about a firmer topper or a board and was told they only had extra pillows, which didn’t help. Ended up sleeping diagonally to find a spot that didn’t sag as much.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on layout/space: I booked a king specifically so I could work comfortably between meetings, but the bed sat so close to the desk that I had to turn sideways to squeeze by. With a carry-on and a garment bag open, there wasn’t a clear path to the window. The closet was shallow, and the vanity shelf couldn’t hold my dopp kit and hair tools at the same time, so I kept juggling items on the toilet tank lid. If you need elbow room, consider asking for a corner unit.",
        "source_4": "Just about the service: three interactions and each felt like pulling teeth. At check-in there was no rundown of Wi‑Fi or amenities; I had to ask where the elevator was. When I requested extra bath towels, it took 45 minutes and a follow-up call, and the runner brought a single hand towel. At checkout I asked if I could push the time by 30 minutes due to a Zoom call; the answer was a flat no and a suggestion to sit in the lobby. Courteous tone, but not the problem-solving approach I expected.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two nights: the room itself was quiet and I slept through without hearing hallway noise, but the surrounding streets thinned out after dark. Walking back from Union Square around 9:30, we passed only a couple of people and several closed storefronts, and I found myself picking up the pace. The fridge had a card mentioning complimentary sodas, yet my folio showed $4 per can until I went back to the desk to get it fixed. Water pressure in the shower was decent, though the basin drained slowly. Next time I might choose something right on the square to avoid the late-night lull."
