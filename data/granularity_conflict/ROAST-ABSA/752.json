        "source_1": "I switched to this phone from a three‑year‑old Moto and have been using it as my daily driver for three weeks. Setup was quick and I loaded my usual stack (WhatsApp, Slack, Outlook, Maps, Pay, banking apps). I routinely keep Maps running with Spotify in the background during a 45‑minute commute, and it hasn’t locked up or forced me to kill apps. The call recording toggle was off by default in the Phone app; after granting microphone and storage permissions, I recorded a 17‑minute call with my airline and both sides were clear when I replayed it on wired earbuds. Daylight photos of my kids in the park look crisp enough to crop for Instagram, and night mode in a dim restaurant kept faces reasonably clean without turning them waxy.",
        "source_2": "I only bought this for the camera and ran a weekend of tests. Indoors under warm LED bulbs, skin tones come out plasticky, and fine details like hair clump together. In low light (living room with a single floor lamp), the lens keeps hunting; I’d tap to focus, get the focus box, and still see a soft result. Shutter response feels laggy—fast‑moving shots (kids jumping off the couch) smear. Outdoors at dusk, the sky gradient bands and foliage turns into mush when zoomed even a little. Video at 1080p shows micro‑stutters when panning across a street, and the audio picks up hiss, making clips sound thin.",
        "source_3": "My main concern was performance because my last phone froze constantly. With this one (6 GB/128 GB), I installed about 70 apps, turned off memory saver, and left animations at default. I can jump between Chrome with 8 tabs, Telegram, Photos editing, and the dialer without it pausing. On a 30‑minute video call over 4G while screen‑sharing a PDF, it didn’t drop frames or heat up beyond warm. I also ran Maps navigation plus YouTube Music on a hot afternoon in the car; no stutters when rerouting. The only hiccup so far was a brief slowdown while the Play Store updated five apps in the background, which cleared once updates finished—no force restarts needed.",
        "source_4": "Bought on the 5th and by the second week I was trying to return it. The dialer crashes twice a day, and the keyboard lags badly when typing long emails—letters appear a half second late. The call recording option is missing in the stock dialer (Google version), and third‑party apps either don’t capture the other side or record only silence. Camera output is soft even in good light; my cat’s fur looks smeared, and indoor photos at a birthday party were a noisy mess. I took it to the service center, they reflashed the software, but the same freezing while switching between YouTube and Maps came back. The store offered an exchange but only at roughly half of what I paid.",
        "source_5": "Sharing only my experience with call recording: out of the box, I couldn’t find the toggle in the Google Phone app. After updating the Phone app and enabling “Allow recording” under Call Recording in Settings, a Record button appeared during calls. There’s a short beep that both parties can hear, but it does capture both sides cleanly. I tested on two 5‑minute calls to my bank and exported the files as .m4a; playback on a laptop was clear enough to catch the agent’s reference number. It still won’t record VoIP calls (WhatsApp/Meet), and if I forget to grant storage permission, it silently fails, but standard carrier calls are being saved reliably."
