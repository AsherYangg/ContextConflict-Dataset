        "source_1": "I stayed at Riu for three nights in late January, arriving around 11:20 pm after a delayed flight. Check-in took about five minutes and I was given room 912 with a partial ocean view; both key cards worked on the first try. Housekeeping refreshed towels and water daily, and I never had to call down for basics. Breakfast at 7 am had a short line, fresh fruit, and an omelet station that moved quickly. The beach gate behind the pool made it easy to get to the sand, and when I asked for a 1 pm checkout because of my afternoon flight, the desk adjusted it without any fuss.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on how the staff handled my reservation. I had a prepaid Expedia booking for Jan 21 after a 10‑day drive around Florida, but at 9 pm the front desk said there were no rooms due to “damaged units.” They walked me to Villa Capri across the street, which isn’t on the beach, and I waited about 40 minutes for the transfer while my bags sat by the lobby. They handed me a paper voucher for breakfast for three and pool access the next day, but couldn’t point to a written policy about moving paid reservations. My card hold didn’t clear until Expedia chased it the following afternoon.",
        "source_3": "Location note only: from the lobby it took me two minutes to hit the sand through the rear gate, and Lincoln Road was an easy 7–8 minute walk. I grabbed late tacos on Washington Ave without needing a car, and ride-share pickups on Collins were straightforward. Morning runs on the boardwalk started right behind the pool, so I could be back and showered before the breakfast rush.",
        "source_4": "Whole stay recap: I was walked on the first night due to overbooking and moved back to Riu the second night. The room I got was compact with a steady A/C hum; Wi‑Fi hovered between 40 and 60 Mbps. Pool chairs filled by 10 am, and the elevators stacked up around checkout time. Coordinating the switch, repacking, and waiting for keys consumed half a day that I had planned for the beach, which colored the rest of the visit.",
        "source_5": "Service snapshot only: I actually arrived a day early by mistake, and Gabriela at the front desk caught it before I did. She called a supervisor, found me a same‑category room, and waived any change fee. She printed a walking map to Lincoln Road, set up two beach chairs under my name, and had extra pillows sent up within 10 minutes. What could have derailed my plans ended up being a non‑issue because of how she handled it."
