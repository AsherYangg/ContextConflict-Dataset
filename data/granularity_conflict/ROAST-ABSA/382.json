        "source_1": "I enrolled because I was dragging myself through study sessions after work, and within the first week I rebuilt my routine using the course’s short videos and practice prompts. The two instructors speak in a calm, conversational tone, and the segments feel like someone sitting across the table explaining why my crammed notes never stick. I switched to 25-minute focus blocks with spaced recall, and I replaced my highlighter habit with quick self-quizzes the course walks you through. The examples about switching between “intense focus” and “looser” thinking mapped perfectly to my coding and anatomy review, and the transcripts made it easy to revisit a tricky idea on the train. The pacing (mostly 6–10 minute clips) kept me moving, and by the second week I had a realistic study plan pinned above my desk.",
        "source_2": "I’m not a native English speaker, so I paid close attention to how clear the lessons were. The instructors use plain words, show the key terms on screen, and repeat definitions right when I need them, which meant I wasn’t constantly pausing. The subtitles match the speech closely, and the diagrams for ideas like “switching modes” and “chunking” made it easy to follow without getting lost. I finished the first two modules without needing a dictionary tab open.",
        "source_3": "I struggled with the delivery style from the instructors. A lot of lines sounded like they were read from a teleprompter, and the camera stayed far enough back that it felt like a studio broadcast rather than someone talking with me. Rhetorical questions were thrown in, but the follow-up often jumped to the next slide without addressing the obvious “what about in my case?” I had to slow the videos to 0.75x to catch transitions because the shifts between analogies and steps weren’t smoothed out. After a while, it felt distant, like watching a recorded lecture where the speaker can’t see my confusion.",
        "source_4": "After finishing about 70% of the course, my overall take is mixed. The early modules gave me a few handy tactics, but by week three the same themes kept circling back with slightly different stories, and I wanted deeper application beyond exam prep. The exercises felt generic—worksheets asked me to “plan a study session” without a concrete template for a complex project at work, and the examples leaned heavily on student scenarios. Discussion boards were quiet when I posted, so I didn’t get much peer input to adapt the methods to my field. The flexible schedule was convenient, but the repetition made it hard to stay engaged, and I ended up skipping several later videos.",
        "source_5": "About the quick feedback prompts after each lesson: I tried filling them out diligently for the first eight videos, but they started to feel identical and broke my momentum. I never saw those responses surface anywhere useful—no summary, no nudge that connected my notes to the next assignment—so it felt like typing into a void. After a few days I just clicked past them to keep my flow. If there were a dashboard that pulled my reflections into a weekly plan, I would have kept using them."
