        "source_1": "I spent a three-night weekend here and the stay was smooth from the moment I rolled my suitcase in. Check-in took under five minutes, and my room on the 12th floor faced a quiet interior courtyard, so I actually slept straight through — rare for me in Midtown. The room had a wall-mounted flat‑screen, a desk that fit my 15-inch laptop, and plenty of outlets. The block itself felt tucked away from the Broadway honking, yet I could walk to Bryant Park and Times Square without breaking a sweat. I’ve done the W Times Square and the Grand Hyatt before; this felt calmer and less chaotic without sacrificing access.",
        "source_2": "I’m rating this purely on location because that’s all I cared about for a quick business trip. My meetings were on the east side, and getting there from the hotel meant either a crosstown cab in morning traffic or two subway transfers; neither was ideal. The nearest station wasn’t right on the corner, and hauling a garment bag in the rain for several blocks wasn’t fun. At night the street got very quiet, which made grabbing a late bite a hassle and a little unnerving when walking back alone. If you want the theater lights right outside your door, this spot sits just far enough away to be inconvenient.",
        "source_3": "I booked specifically because people kept saying the rooms are quiet, but that wasn’t my experience. On the fourth floor, I could hear the ice machine cycling and doors thudding every time someone on the hall came or went. The HVAC unit kicked on and off with a noticeable buzz, and around 5 a.m. delivery trucks started backing up outside with that beeping that goes on forever. Earplugs helped, but I was up earlier than planned both mornings.",
        "source_4": "Focusing just on room size: for a standard king in Manhattan, it worked well for us. My partner and I each had a full-size suitcase open on the floor without playing Tetris, and there was still a clear path to the bathroom. The closet took two coats and a suit bag, the desk had enough depth for a laptop and notebook, and I wasn’t banging my knee on furniture trying to get around the bed. The shower had decent elbow room, and the vanity had shelf space for two dopp kits. It felt thoughtfully laid out rather than crammed.",
        "source_5": "Taking the whole stay into account, the pieces didn’t come together for me. Housekeeping missed obvious things — there were crumbs under the desk chair and a ring in the sink that stayed put after service. The TV remote lagged so badly that changing channels felt like a mini-game, and I waited close to ten minutes for an elevator more than once during the morning rush. The front desk promised a 1 p.m. late checkout but my key died at noon, so I had to queue again just to get back into the room. I’d look at other options next time."
