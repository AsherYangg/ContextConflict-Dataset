        "source_1": "I picked this up to see if it would ease my spring congestion. I brewed 2 teaspoons in 8 ounces at about 205°F for 6 minutes, morning and night, for five days straight. The steam felt nice, but my chest still felt tight on my evening walks, and I ended up reaching for my usual inhaler like always. I finished the week and then went back to my eucalyptus blend because I didn’t notice any change in my breathing.",
        "source_2": "As an overall take: the resealable pouch kept the leaves crisp, and the first mug right after delivery felt smooth with a clean herbal finish. I steeped one bag in 10 ounces of just-off-boil water for 4 minutes and added a squeeze of lemon. Within the first cup, my chest felt clearer and the nagging tickle in my throat settled down. I ran through the box in about ten days and set another order so I don’t run out.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on freshness and packaging only: my box arrived with the inner foil sleeve slightly open, and a lot of the bags were crushed into dust. Several staples tore through the paper when I pulled the string. The scent was faint even on day one, and the liquor stayed pale unless I used two bags per mug. It never gave that lively aroma I expect from a new batch.",
        "source_4": "Flavor-only perspective: the profile leans medicinal with a licorice edge. At 3 minutes (195°F) it tastes thin; at 6 minutes it turns sharp, with a lingering chalky afterfeel. The best balance I found was 4 minutes at 195°F with a teaspoon of honey, which took the edge off but didn’t remove the slight grit that settles at the bottom.",
        "source_5": "Value/use rate: I paid about $1.10 per ounce for two 3.5 oz pouches. Because a single teaspoon brewed up light for me, I used two heaping teaspoons per 12-ounce mug. That meant one pouch lasted roughly nine days with a daily cup. For my routine, it’s more of an occasional treat than a daily staple unless the price drops.",
        "source_6": "Overall impression after a month: I tried one cup each evening, experimented between 185°F and boiling, and rotated steep times from 3 to 8 minutes. The taste swung from watery to bitter depending on small changes, and I didn’t notice any shift in breathing or sleep. The fine particles that collect at the bottom give a gritty last sip. I finished the bag to avoid waste but didn’t place another order."
