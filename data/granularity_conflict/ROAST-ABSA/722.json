        "source_1": "I went through the course in three evenings. The instructor breaks down the routine into small steps—the morning scan, mid-day reset, end-of-day wrap-up. I printed the habit tracker and started on Monday; it took me 8–10 minutes each morning to set priorities. By Thursday I had moved two recurring meetings and carved a 90-minute focus block. The examples mirrored what I see in a typical tech job, so applying the system at work was straightforward.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically for breadth, and from that angle it felt thin. The modules circle around basic time blocking and a weekly review, with little on rotating shifts, seasonal workloads, or balancing client projects with classes. Email triage gets a quick “batch it” mention, and project planning never goes beyond a one-page grid. The scenarios skew toward office schedules; as a freelance photographer, I didn’t see guidance for travel days or last-minute shoots. I closed the last lesson still piecing together gaps from forum threads.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on practicality: the “two-minute cleanup” and the five-slot daily plan translated immediately for me. I taped the one-page sheet to my monitor and checked it before lunch and again at 3 p.m., which kept me from wandering into Slack rabbit holes. The calendar color trick showed exactly where my week was overloaded, and the suggested script for rescheduling meetings worked almost word-for-word with my manager when I asked to move a recurring stand-up.",
        "source_4": "As a grad student with lab hours, I tried the routine for two weeks and struggled to keep pace. The morning plan took about 35 minutes on day one and settled around 25, which ate the only quiet window before experiments. Lecture 4 runs roughly 26 minutes and assigns a full week of task mapping; I spent a Saturday night filling the template and slipped behind on prep for Monday’s assays. I paused midway and went back to a simple notebook list to stay sane during crunch time.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on ease of following: the slides pack dense bullets in small fonts, and the voiceover rushes through new terms like “context buckets” and “load factor” without keeping definitions visible. Captions drop a few phrases, and the PDFs label steps differently than the videos—“wrap-up” vs. “evening review”—so I kept rewinding to confirm whether they meant the same thing. It took extra time to build a clean checklist because the naming wasn’t consistent across materials."
