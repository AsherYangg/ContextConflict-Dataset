        "source_1": "I stayed two nights for a conference and spent a lot of time in the public areas—marble floors, big chandeliers, busy bar scene. My standard room, though, looked worn: paint flaking near the window frame, rust flecks around the towel rack, and the shower only warmed to tepid after several minutes. I’m 5’10”, and the showerhead sat just about at shoulder level, so rinsing my hair was awkward. On the plus side, the front desk sent up extra towels within ten minutes, and a club sandwich from room service showed up in about twenty-five. I found myself lingering in the lobby and restaurants and treating the room mostly as a place to sleep.",
        "source_2": "I zero in on showers when I travel, and mine on the eighth floor did exactly what I needed. Hot water kicked in within thirty seconds, pressure stayed steady, and the showerhead was adjustable and above eye level (I’m 6’1”). I took two long showers without any drop-offs, and didn’t need to fiddle with the knobs once I set the temperature.",
        "source_3": "My room didn’t have a coffee maker or a mini-fridge, and the toiletries felt thrown together—one small bar of soap, a travel-size shampoo, and a conditioner, each from a different brand. When I called down, the front desk told me there’s a coffee station in the lobby, which meant a pajama-and-slippers trek each morning. There was an iron and board in the closet, but no bottled water and nothing beyond the basics in the bathroom.",
        "source_4": "I arrived close to midnight after a delayed flight, and the staff made the check-in painless. The front desk handed me bottled water without me asking, housekeeping brought an extra blanket in under ten minutes, and room service answered immediately; a soup and salad arrived still hot and crisp. The bellman helped me sort out a wonky keycard without any fuss and checked back later to confirm it was working.",
        "source_5": "The bathroom told the story in my room: dark patches along the grout line near the tub, a faint damp smell when the shower started, and pitting on the faucet handles. I also wiped dust off the desk and the top of the headboard with a tissue. Housekeeping replaced the bathmat when I called, but the tile around the drain looked tired and discolored.",
        "source_6": "I had a midweek stay and must have lucked out with the room assignment. Fresh paint with clean edges, chrome fixtures free of corrosion, and bright white tile in the bathroom. The shower ran hot and consistent, and the bath amenities were all Biltmore-branded, neatly set on a tray. I spent most of my time working in the room because the desk chair and lighting made it easy to camp out, and check-out the next morning took under a minute."
