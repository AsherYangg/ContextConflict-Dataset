        "source_1": "I come to New Orleans for client visits every few months, and this place has worked out really well for me overall. Check-in took under five minutes at 1 p.m., and they found me a quiet interior room overlooking the little courtyard. The brick walls kept the room calm even on a Saturday, and housekeeping kept everything tidy without being intrusive. I could walk to Jackson Square in about five minutes and grab beignets before meetings, and the lobby bar made a proper Sazerac after I wrapped up for the day. For what I paid on a midweek rate, the whole stay felt fair, and I left feeling like the trip ran smoothly.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on location: my room faced Bourbon Street, and the street noise was relentless. Brass bands and crowds went late into the night, and even with the provided earplugs I could feel the bass thumping through the window. Rideshare drivers struggled to get close because of closures, so pickup involved standing on a corner a block away. It’s an easy walk to bars, but it turned into a 20-minute trek to the Convention Center in the morning humidity, which wasn’t ideal for an 8 a.m. start.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on service: valet took 40 minutes to bring the car around each time, and the front desk kept saying “someone’s on the way” when we called for extra towels. Housekeeping eventually arrived after an hour and a half, and the concierge booked us on a ghost tour that never showed at the meeting point. When we tried to follow up, the line at the desk moved slowly, and the only resolution offered was a couple of drink vouchers that didn’t make up for the hassle.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on price and value: my bill came to $289 per night before taxes, plus $49 for valet and a nightly fee I hadn’t noticed at booking. The room itself was compact—maybe 200 square feet—with a window facing a brick wall, and the in-lobby coffee was $5. Upgraded Wi‑Fi cost extra. For that total, I kept thinking a similarly priced boutique nearby includes breakfast and throws in a drink ticket, so the add-ons here added up fast.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture take: stayed during Jazz Fest, and the property looked charming from the street, but the experience was bumpy. The check-in line stretched to the door, the elevator waits hit ten minutes at peak times, and our room had a damp smell with an AC unit that rattled through the night. Hallway noise at 2 a.m. made it tough to wind down, and the lobby felt chaotic each evening with crowds spilling in from the Quarter. I left feeling like the setting was memorable, but the stay didn’t come together the way I hoped."
