        "source_1": "I’ve had this phone since February 2023 and specifically paid attention to the power button because I use it a lot for double-press camera launch. The click is still crisp, no wobble, and the paint on the ridge hasn’t rubbed off. I don’t use a case most days and the phone rides in my jeans pocket with keys; even after a couple of months of gaming sessions where I’m constantly tapping it to wake the screen, the button hasn’t turned mushy or stuck.",
        "source_2": "I visited the Andheri service center in August 2023 after my device started doing random restarts. They ran diagnostics in front of me, pulled logs, and showed a battery connector error. They photographed the device on all sides, noted “no physical damage” on the job sheet, and replaced the connector under warranty. I paid nothing and picked it up the next afternoon with the repair details clearly stamped and signed.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday phone, it’s been steady for me over the last year. I’m on Jio for calls, use Google Maps and Spotify during commutes, and end most days with 20–30% left. There were two surprise reboots after a March update, but a small patch the following week stopped that. Calls are clear, outdoor visibility is fine on the highway, and the fingerprint reader hasn’t missed often. I haven’t felt the need to carry a spare.",
        "source_4": "Three months in, mine started shutting off around 30–40% battery, sometimes right in the middle of navigation. The area near the camera warms up and then it powers down without warning. I tried safe mode, cache wipe, and a full reset—no change. I’ve missed OTPs and work calls because it decides to go dark at random, so I keep it plugged into a power bank when I’m out to avoid the sudden blackouts.",
        "source_5": "From the first week, the power key felt a bit spongy, and by month two it had a slight wobble that made long-press power options hit-or-miss. When the auto-restarts started in April, I took it to the MG Road service desk; they pointed to a tiny scuff on the frame and said the repair would be chargeable. I asked them to put in writing that they believed it was due to a drop; they wouldn’t, and only offered a paid motherboard swap. Between the unreliable button and the surprise shutdowns, traveling for work with this phone has been stressful."
