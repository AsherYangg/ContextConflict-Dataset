        "source_1": "I picked up this phone mainly for work travel and have been testing the radios pretty hard. Dual-SIM (Airtel + Jio), VoLTE on both, and I hop between office Wi‑Fi and 4G all day. Calls connect on the first try with no dead air, even when I’m walking out of the elevator. I ran a dozen speed tests around my neighborhood and saw 28–55 Mbps consistently, and I tethered my laptop for a 40‑minute Zoom on a moving bus without a dropout. The only hiccup was in a basement garage where every phone I’ve owned struggles.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on battery: unplug at 7:00 a.m., end the day around 11:30 p.m. with roughly 35% left. That’s with 1 hour of calls, 45 minutes of Maps, Spotify on cellular during my commute, and about 2 hours of social and email. Screen-on time hovers around 6.5–7 hours. A quick lunch break charge of ~20 minutes typically takes me from ~30% to ~70%, which gets me through the rest of the day without hunting for an outlet.",
        "source_3": "Two weeks in, the phone is a headache for basic calling. The first outgoing call of the day often connects with no audio on either side; I end up redialing two or three times before we can hear each other. Even when it works, the earpiece is faint at max, and people complain I sound far away unless I switch to speaker. Mobile data will jump from LTE to EDGE in downtown traffic, and speed tests swing wildly between 3 Mbps and 40 Mbps on the same spot. By late afternoon I’m down to 20% and carrying a power bank. Support had me reset network settings, which helped for a day, then the same issues came back.",
        "source_4": "I bought it for the advertised quick top-ups, so I measured it. Using the in-box 33W charger: 10% to 80% took 52 minutes, and a 20-minute plug added only about 30%. A USB power meter shows it sitting at 9V/2A most of the session, occasionally ramping then throttling when the phone warms near the USB‑C port. For me, it’s not the “sip-and-go” style charge I expected before heading out.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on call audio only: the first call after the phone has been idle is often mute, with the timer ticking but no sound. I hang up, try again, sometimes a third time, then audio finally comes through. During busy streets, the in-call volume feels low enough that I cup the earpiece to catch words. On speakerphone it’s acceptable, but I can’t always use that in public. I swapped SIMs, cleaned the grill, and even tried a different dialer app—same behavior.",
        "source_6": "I’ve used this as my daily driver for a month across two SIMs and lots of commuting. Calls pick up right away, and the earpiece is loud enough to take a quick client chat on a crowded platform. The phone hangs onto LTE in the metro tunnels where my previous device would drop to “no service.” Battery easily covers a full workday with a mix of Slack, hotspotting a laptop for 30–40 minutes, and streaming radio; a 15–20 minute plug before dinner typically lands me near 60%. It’s been reliable enough that I stopped carrying my backup phone."
