        "source_1": "I bought this bag of wheat gluten to try a seitan recipe, but my household includes a kid with a peanut allergy, so I comb through labels before anything enters the pantry. The product page didn’t call it out, and when the bag arrived I found, in small print near the nutrition panel, that it’s processed on equipment that also handles peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, and soy. That’s a deal-breaker for us; cross-contact risk is exactly what our allergist warned us about. I didn’t even break the seal—moved it straight into a zip bag and set it aside. I wish the allergen statement were shown on the listing, because I would’ve chosen a different brand that certifies dedicated lines. Keeping epinephrine pens handy isn’t the plan for a staple ingredient.",
        "source_2": "From a cooking perspective, this gluten performed the way I expect. I made two batches of seitan: 1 cup gluten to roughly 3/4 cup water with 1 tablespoon soy sauce, kneaded 10 minutes, rested 30, then simmered gently in broth for 45 minutes (not boiling). The texture came out springy with a nice bite, and it held together during a pan sear without crumbling. I also did a 20% addition to bread flour for bagels—chew improved and the rise was strong. No odd smell, and hydration was predictable; it didn’t require extra water compared to other brands. The bag isn’t resealable, so I transferred the remainder to an airtight container to keep out moisture.",
        "source_3": "I only want to talk about Amazon’s grocery policy here. I tried to return this unopened bag after noticing the cross-contact warning because we don’t bring shared-equipment products into our kitchen. The return flow flatly said grocery items aren’t returnable. I contacted chat support, explained the allergy situation, and the rep offered a small courtesy credit but not a return label. The item is sealed and safe to donate, but that doesn’t help the budget when the listing doesn’t display the allergen statement up front. If the platform won’t accept returns on food, clearer product pages become pretty important.",
        "source_4": "My focus is labeling transparency. The seller’s page shows nutrition facts and a generic description, but no photo of the full ingredient panel where the allergen processing statement usually lives. I took a chance and ordered, and sure enough the warning is printed in fine text on the back. I had to use the camera on my phone to zoom in to read it. Uploading the label photo seems trivial—it’s one image that prevents buyers with allergies from ending up with something they can’t use. It’s frustrating to discover critical info only after delivery.",
        "source_5": "Overall, this worked fine across a week of batch cooking, though the packaging could be better. The bag arrived in a thin poly mailer; the corner was scuffed and there was a dusting of powder in the envelope, so I suspect a pinhole before it reached me. I sifted the remainder—no clumps or off odors—and used it in a vegan “chicken” recipe (gluten plus chickpea flour, pressure-cooked 35 minutes). Texture was consistent, and the protein held up in a stir-fry without turning mushy. I moved the rest into a mason jar with a desiccant pack because the factory seal isn’t resealable, and moisture will ruin gluten fast."
