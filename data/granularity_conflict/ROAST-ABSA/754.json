        "source_1": "I worked through the entire machine learning course over eight weeks while juggling a full-time job. The weekly roadmap made it clear what to watch and what to code: short video segments, a quiz, and one programming exercise in Octave/Matlab. By the midpoint I had implemented logistic regression with regularization and could diagnose bias vs. variance using learning curves. The neural network assignment at the end pulled the concepts together nicely. The time commitment averaged 6–8 hours per week for me, and I came away applying the ideas to a small Kaggle project at work.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on captions: I rely on subtitles because English isn’t my first language, and several lectures had transcription quirks that slowed me down. In the Week 3 regularization videos, “lambda” was shown as “lamba” or “landa” multiple times, and “gradient descent” appeared as “grated descent” in one segment. Mathematical symbols like α and θ were inconsistently labeled, so I had to pause, rewind, and cross-check with the PDF notes to make sure I didn’t mix up the parameters. When the captions were accurate, I could follow along easily, but the inconsistency added extra study time.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I stopped at Week 4 because the pace didn’t match my background. The first two weeks felt approachable, then the jump into multivariate calculus and matrix calculus came faster than I expected. The programming exercises are heavily scaffolded, but I spent more time fighting Octave setup and autograder quirks than thinking about the concepts. The discussion forum had plenty of old threads, yet recent questions weren’t getting much traction, so I was often stuck waiting or searching external blogs. I never reached the backpropagation assignment because the weekly deadlines collided with my work sprint.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the autograder: the tolerance checks were touchy on my machine. For the regularized logistic regression task, my cost and gradient matched the formulas, but the grader failed until I switched to “format long” and avoided intermediate rounding. Another week, a stray newline in my output caused a mismatch. On an M1 Mac, Octave installation required Homebrew, XQuartz, and a workaround for gnuplot, which took an evening to sort out. Once the environment was stable, submissions went through, but the early friction was real.",
        "source_5": "My overall impression centers on the instructor’s delivery and structure. Each topic starts with intuition and a visual example, followed by the math and then a vectorized implementation, which helped me connect the dots. I finished all quizzes with scores above 90% and kept notes that I still reference for bias/variance and learning rate tuning. The tooling leans on Octave instead of Python, so the workflows feel a bit dated, but I picked up habits around vectorization and gradient checking that transferred directly to NumPy. If there were a follow-on class with more case studies in modern tooling, I’d sign up."
