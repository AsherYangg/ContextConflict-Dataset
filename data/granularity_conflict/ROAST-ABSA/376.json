        "source_1": "I bought this OnePlus two months ago mainly for quick edits on the go. On my commute, I trim and color‑tune 1080p clips in CapCut and InShot offline, and the phone doesn’t lock up; a 1:30 clip with two filters exports in under a minute. BGMI on balanced/60 fps and Asphalt 9 feel steady, and jumping between Instagram, Gmail, and Chrome tabs is snappy. If it slows at all, it’s usually right after an update while it’s indexing files, then it settles down.",
        "source_2": "Coming from a OnePlus 6, I picked this up expecting the same snap in everyday use and didn’t get it. Within the first week, the dialer lagged for a few seconds, and opening the gallery stalled often. Trying to crop a 2‑minute 1080p video in the stock editor offline froze the phone twice until I forced a reboot. After two months, I turned off animations and even did a factory reset; the hiccups kept returning during basic tasks, so I went back to my older phone.",
        "source_3": "My experience with the company itself has been solid. At day 20, the volume rocker felt mushy, and the authorized service center in Koramangala replaced the mid‑frame the same afternoon under warranty. I’ve received two OTA updates in three months, including an August security patch and some camera tuning. Chat support followed up the next day to confirm everything was working.",
        "source_4": "I focus mostly on battery and charging. With 120 Hz on, dual SIM, and mostly Wi‑Fi, I’m seeing 7–8 hours of screen‑on time: about 2 hours YouTube, 45 minutes Maps, an hour of Teams calls, plus social scrolling. Overnight drain is around 2–3%. The 80W charger gets me from 15% to 90% in roughly 27 minutes consistently.",
        "source_5": "After a month as my main phone, it’s met what I need. Switching between Slack, Outlook, and Chrome is smooth, and I cut 4K/30 clips in VN offline with a couple of transitions; a 2‑minute export takes around 1:20 while the device stays cool. The display is readable in sunlight, the haptics feel tight, and the speaker is loud enough for podcasts in the kitchen. For what I paid during the sale, it’s been a good daily driver.",
        "source_6": "If you plan to do offline edits, my unit struggles. KineMaster and the stock gallery both freeze when trimming anything longer than 90 seconds; gestures stop responding and the phone heats near the camera bump. Even scrubbing HDR clips in the gallery stutters. I cleared cache, disabled RAM expansion, and tried airplane mode to cut background sync—same result every time."
