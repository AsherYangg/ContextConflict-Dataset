        "source_1": "I picked the graphite variant and the phone looks fresh in person: slim bezels, a clean camera module, and a matte back that hides fingerprints. The frame has a brushed finish and the buttons feel tight, no rattle. A couple of friends assumed it was from this year’s lineup when they saw it with a clear case on my desk. For me, the design reads modern rather than throwback.",
        "source_2": "As an overall package, it feels like a budget model wearing an old suit. The chin is chunky, the notch is the teardrop style, and the glossy back collected scuffs in a weekend despite babying it. After restoring apps, animations hitch when jumping between Maps, Instagram, and the camera. At this price point, I wish I had gone with the iQOO Z7 instead.",
        "source_3": "I traded in my battered OnePlus 5 on Flipkart—screen cracked top to bottom—and the pickup agent still honored the full 3,000 exchange bonus after checking the IMEI and buttons. With a card offer stacked, the final amount came to 12,999. The handoff was smooth: old phone collected and new unit delivered the same evening, and the app checkout took less than five minutes.",
        "source_4": "I chased the same 3k exchange on Flipkart but the value dropped to 1,200 at the doorstep because of a tiny dent by the SIM tray, even though my OnePlus 5 boots fine and the cameras work. Support kept me bouncing between chat and a callback, and the invoice wouldn’t update. I ended up paying 14.3k, which erased the appeal of the deal.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on endurance and charging: with dual SIM (Jio + Airtel), 90 Hz enabled, and a mix of WhatsApp, YouTube, and about an hour of BGMI, I’m seeing roughly 7–8 hours of screen-on time. Overnight idle drain sits around 1–2%. The 33W charger takes it from 10% to ~80% in a bit over half an hour, and it stays cool during long navigation sessions.",
        "source_6": "After two weeks, as a daily driver it holds up: calls on VoWiFi are clear, UPI transactions are instant, and Spotify over Bluetooth doesn’t stutter in the car. Daytime photos of documents are crisp enough, the mono speaker carries podcasts, and indoor 5G is consistent. I paid about 12.5k after exchange and a bank offer on Flipkart, so the purchase feels well-judged. The look is plain, but a slim case tidies it up."
