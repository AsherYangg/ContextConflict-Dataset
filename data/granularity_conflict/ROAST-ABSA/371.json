        "source_1": "I’m only weighing in on breakfast because that’s all I used on a quick stopover. Friday at 7:15 a.m. the buffet already had scrambled eggs, a waffle station going, cut pineapple and melon, and two carafes of strong coffee. The attendant walked the line every few minutes, swapping out pastries and wiping spills. Tables were cleared promptly and there were real plates and metal cutlery, not flimsy disposables. I sat for half an hour reading the paper and refilling my mug without anyone hovering. For getting out the door fast before traffic, it did the job.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing just on housekeeping. Over a four-night stay, they came around midday, knocked twice, waited for an answer, and announced themselves before entering. After service, our door was fully latched every time; I checked because I’m picky about that. They left extra towels and a couple of makeup-remover packets after I wrote a note, and they folded the blanket I’d tossed on the chair. We used the in-room safe for passports, but I also left headphones and a charger on the desk and everything was exactly where I left it. On our floor I never saw a door propped open or unattended carts blocking the hall.",
        "source_3": "I arrived late Thursday (about 10:30 p.m.) for a family gathering, grabbed breakfast in the morning, and headed out until midafternoon. When we came back around 4:00 p.m., one suitcase was gone and the closet door was wide open. At the front desk the first thing I heard was, “Do you want us to call the police?” which felt like they were handing the issue off rather than walking me through next steps. The property sits behind a gate, yet I counted three rooms on our floor with doors ajar and no staff in sight when we returned. Security reviewed footage but said the camera angle didn’t capture our doorway. Most of Friday evening was spent filing reports instead of being with my relatives, and I learned about the room safe only after the fact.",
        "source_4": "Just reviewing the room itself. Our double-queen on the second floor faced the courtyard and stayed quiet even when cars rolled through the gate. The mattresses were supportive, linens crisp, and the AC kept a steady temperature without rattling. Water pressure in the shower was strong at 7 a.m., and the bathroom fan actually cleared steam. Lighting was thoughtful—two bedside lamps plus an overhead—so I could read easily. Blackout curtains sealed well and we slept past sunrise without any light leaking in.",
        "source_5": "Overall stay on a three-night business trip: check-in took five minutes and the gate guard verified my name every evening when I drove back. I parked inside the fenced lot and saw a security cart make loops around dusk. The front desk offered a complimentary safe key card at check-in; I stored my laptop there and left a camera in my backpack in the room, and nothing shifted. Housekeeping left a note reminding me to scramble the safe code and tucked charging cables neatly beside the lamp. Breakfast got busy but the line moved quickly and staff kept refilling the hot items. Given the location near the highway and the quick access to the airport, I’d pick the same place for the next trip."
