        "source_1": "I bought this phone mainly to stop babysitting the charger, and it’s been doing that job. With two SIMs and the screen at around 50%, I stream Spotify and Maps during a 90‑minute commute, take a couple of Teams calls, and message all day. By 10 p.m. I’m usually sitting at 35–40%. On a Saturday with three hours of GPS and a bit of video recording, I still don’t reach for the cable until late evening. Standby drain overnight is 2–3% with Wi‑Fi on, and a quick top‑up over lunch takes me from 20% to around 70% in under forty minutes. I don’t micromanage power settings beyond disabling always‑on display, and it’s still predictable.",
        "source_2": "Coming from four years with an IPS LCD, the brightness curve on this screen feels aggressive. Even at the lowest slider, reading in a dark room is harsh on my eyes, so I’ve enabled night mode, reduced white point, and switched to a black theme just to make bedtime browsing comfortable. I tried the “extra dim” accessibility toggle, which helps a bit, but any white background still jumps out more than I’m used to. Outdoors it’s punchy, but indoors I’m constantly babysitting the brightness to keep it under control.",
        "source_3": "Learned quickly that there’s no water protection here. A short walk in light rain left the speaker sounding muffled, and the phone threw a moisture warning when I plugged in a cable. I checked the SIM tray—no rubber gasket—and ended up parking the phone in a bag of silica gel overnight. It recovered, but that experience changed how I carry it: no bathroom counter while showering, no pockets without an umbrella, and a case with port covers for good measure. If you’re around water, you’ll need habits to compensate.",
        "source_4": "Two months in, I’m using this as a secondary device for work chats and weekend photos. The camera handles family shots and documents without fuss, and the battery easily keeps pace with a full day of messages, browsing, and some maps. The processor isn’t a speed demon, but it deals fine with basic multitasking; the occasional pause is noticeable when swapping between heavier apps. Weight is the one thing I feel constantly—slips into my jeans pocket and tugs more than my previous phone, and extended one‑handed use gives my wrist a workout. The screen is vivid and easy to read outdoors, though indoors I keep the brightness way down to avoid glare. Since there’s no water protection, I don’t take it out on rainy runs. For everyday stuff, it’s been dependable.",
        "source_5": "I pay attention to the chip because I juggle Sheets, Gmail, and a couple of finance dashboards. There’s a slight delay when launching the camera from the lock screen and quick‑switching between heavy tabs, like a half‑second hitch in animations. During a 40‑minute LTE video call, the area near the camera module warms up and the UI feels less responsive when returning to the home screen. For messaging, email, and quick web checks it behaves fine, but spreadsheet filters and bulk exports remind me this isn’t a performance‑focused setup.",
        "source_6": "I shoot a lot for social: food shots, street scenes, and short clips. The main lens gets color right under warm café lights, and the shutter responds fast enough to catch action without multiple retakes. Stabilization in 4K at 30 keeps footsteps from turning into jitter when walking, and detail holds up when I crop into signage afterward. Selfies don’t smear features, and portrait mode handles edges around curly hair better than I expected. Night photos need a steady hand, but the results are usable without looking like watercolor."
