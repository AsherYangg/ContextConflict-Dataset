        "source_1": "I booked mainly for the look of the rooms, and that’s where I was let down. Our unit had glossy faux-wood furniture with edges lifting, a headboard nicked in several spots, and a coffee table with ring marks that never came out. The color scheme was a tired beige-and-taupe, the wall art looked like stock prints, and the lighting was either glare-bright or dim with no in-between. In the bathroom, the mirror showed silvering at the edges and the grout along the floor line had dark patches. Even the sliding closet doors rattled on their tracks. If you’re coming for a fresh, design-forward space, this isn’t it.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about sleep, so here’s just the bed report: the king mattress in our room ran soft in the middle and I kept rolling into a dip by 3 a.m. The pillows looked plentiful, but every option I tried was either overstuffed and hard on my neck or too floppy to keep its shape. I could feel a bit of bounce whenever my partner turned, and the fitted sheet wouldn’t stay tucked near the footboard, so I was pulling it back into place every morning. I woke up with a tight lower back both days, which doesn’t happen at home.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on location: getting around on foot wasn’t as effortless as I expected. The “short walk” to the beach was fine without bags, but with a stroller we hit a couple of curb cuts that were steep and had to wait through long light cycles at Ala Moana Blvd. Ala Moana Center looked close on the map, yet the drive midafternoon took 20 minutes with stop-and-go traffic, and parking wasn’t cheap. Even the walk to the lagoon felt longer in the heat with limited shade, and crossing to the Hilton area meant navigating busy intersections. We ended up ridesharing more than planned.",
        "source_4": "For an overall take, our five-night stay in the Ilikai Tower on the 13th floor worked well for a low-key beach week. The balcony faced toward the Hilton lagoon and the water, and mornings with coffee out there were the best part of the day. Check-in was straightforward, the room had a small fridge for snacks, and we found an ABC Store downstairs for basics. We walked to the beach in flip-flops, grabbed poke bowls nearby, and used a quick rideshare to Ala Moana when we didn’t feel like walking. Nothing over-the-top, but the combination of view, easy access to the shoreline, and simple amenities fit what we wanted.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture impression after three nights: lots of little snags added up. The elevators backed up around check-in and after dinner, the in-room A/C rattled unless we set it to a higher temperature than we liked, and Friday fireworks by the lagoon were loud enough that our toddler couldn’t settle until they ended. Our partial ocean view had a sizable slice blocked by a neighboring building, housekeeping skipped our floor once so we called down for towels, and valet pricing stung given the wait to retrieve the car. Between the noise, delays, and extra fees, the stay felt more work than it should have."
