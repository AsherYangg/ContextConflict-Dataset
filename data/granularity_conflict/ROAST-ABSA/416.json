        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for battery life, and it’s been rock solid for me. I unplug around 6:30 a.m., run two SIMs, keep the screen at 120 Hz, stream Spotify for about 90 minutes, do a 40-minute GPS commute with Bluetooth on, and snap a handful of photos during the day. By 10:30 p.m., I’m usually sitting at 20–30% without using battery saver. Overnight standby drain is about 2–3% for eight hours. I even watched a 90-minute YouTube video on LTE at lunch and still didn’t reach for a charger.",
        "source_2": "The only thing I want to talk about is the gallery performance. When I open a freshly taken shot, it comes up soft for two or three seconds and then snaps into clarity, like it’s doing heavy processing. Scrolling through a grid of thumbnails stutters every few swipes, and jumping into a full-resolution photo sometimes takes four seconds before it’s crisp. I cleared cache, disabled face recognition preview, and even tried a different SD card—same behavior. Other apps feel fine; it’s just the photos app that drags.",
        "source_3": "I use this as my family camera, and it’s been dependable. At my kid’s indoor birthday party (warm café lighting), faces looked clean without waxy smoothing, and skin tones were consistent across shots. The shutter responded quickly, autofocus latched onto moving kids without hunting, and 2x zoom shots kept good detail for printing 5x7s. Night mode on the street pulled readable text from a dim shop sign, and 4K30 video looked steady during a slow walk. I didn’t notice any weird softness when reviewing shots in the moment.",
        "source_4": "After two weeks as my daily driver, I’m carrying a power bank again. With email, WhatsApp, light browsing, and about 20 minutes of camera use, the battery hits the 30% mark by mid‑afternoon, so I top up around 3 p.m. Unlocking with the fingerprint reader is hit‑or‑miss—if my thumb is even slightly damp, I often end up typing the PIN after two attempts. The gallery is sluggish: photos open blurry and then clear up a couple of seconds later, and jumping between images takes longer than it should. Daylight photos look fine, but the delays get in the way when I’m trying to grab quick shots.",
        "source_5": "I’m only weighing in on the fingerprint sensor. I put a tempered glass protector on day one, enrolled both thumbs, and it’s been consistent. From the screen‑off state, the phone unlocks in what feels like a quarter second, and I get in on the first try almost every time—even after washing my hands and not fully drying them. I counted roughly 100 unlocks on a busy day at work and had maybe one miss. It also works reliably with my banking app’s biometric login.",
        "source_6": "As an overall package, it’s been smooth for me. The system feels responsive, apps open quickly, and the gallery pulls up photos without that soft‑then‑sharp delay I’ve seen on some other devices. I get through a 12‑hour day with music streaming, messaging, an hour of social media, and about 30 photos without hunting for a charger. The camera produces pleasing daylight shots and decent indoor results, and the fingerprint reader gets me in fast enough that I don’t think about it. The only quirk I noticed is a brief “processing” flash if I zoom in immediately after taking an HDR photo, but it doesn’t slow me down."
