        "source_1": "I booked it mainly for the station access. I rolled my suitcase off the train and was at the front desk in under five minutes. Trams and canal tour docks were right outside, so getting around was easy without taxis. Late-night noise from buses and sirens carried up from the street, so I kept earplugs on the nightstand, but the convenience of being steps from Centraal saved a lot of time.",
        "source_2": "I’m 6'2\" and the bed was tight against the wall, with about a foot of clearance on the other side. I had to slide my carry-on under the sink because there wasn’t space to open it fully on the floor. The shower was narrow enough that the curtain brushed against me the whole time, and the small sink splashed easily. If you need a spot to spread out a laptop and papers, the corner ledge isn’t really up to it.",
        "source_3": "As a short city break, it did the job. I paid around 60 euros a night, walked to Centraal Station in the morning, and used the place mostly to sleep and rinse off. The room was compact but neat, the sheets changed daily, and the breakfast tray had bread, cheese, and coffee that got me moving. There was an adult channel on the TV menu that felt out of place, but staff were straightforward and check-in took less than five minutes. I spent what I saved on museum tickets and canal rides, which was exactly my plan.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about mornings, so I paid attention to the breakfast. It ran from 7 to 10 and was a simple spread: white rolls, slices of ham and cheese, a few yogurts, and a push-button coffee machine. No hot items beyond a toaster, and fruit was limited to some apples. It filled the gap before sightseeing, but if you’re after a big start to the day, you’ll probably want to grab something at the station bakery.",
        "source_5": "I care a lot about cleanliness, and the room met that bar. The bathroom tiles and grout looked recently scrubbed, no soap scum on the glass, and a fresh bleach smell when I opened the door. Sheets were crisp, no stray hairs on the pillowcases, and the carpet had visible vacuum lines. Housekeeping replaced towels daily without me having to ask.",
        "source_6": "I booked for the rate, but the stay felt more like a compromise than a deal. The room’s narrow layout made it hard to relax, and the window seemed to let in tram bells and late-night chatter from the street. The TV defaulted to an adult channel in the guide, which was awkward while traveling with my teenager. Breakfast was the sort of thing you’d grab when nothing else is open, and I ended up eating at the station café instead. Next time I’d spend more for extra space and a quieter setting."
