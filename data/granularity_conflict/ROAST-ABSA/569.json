        "source_1": "I switched both of my cats—one Siamese and one Maine Coon—to this kibble last month. Bowls are cleared within five minutes, the Siamese has stopped begging between meals, and the litter box smells less sharp. Their coats catch the kitchen light in a nicer way, and the Maine Coon’s finicky stomach hasn’t acted up. I measure 1/3 cup twice a day and haven’t seen mid-day crashes or pacing.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on kibble size: the pieces are thick, roughly 10–12 mm, and a bit triangular. My Siamese pushes them around and leaves half-chewed bits by the bowl; the Maine Coon crunches them without effort. When I add a splash of water, the texture turns gummy and sticks to their teeth, so I’ve stopped trying to soften it.",
        "source_3": "On smell and taste acceptance: the bag releases a strong fishy aroma when opened, and it lingers in the feeding area. Day one, both cats sampled a few bites; by day three, the Siamese sniffed and walked away unless I mixed in a spoon of wet food. The Maine Coon eats most of it overnight but often leaves the last quarter of the bowl untouched, which didn’t happen with their previous chicken formula.",
        "source_4": "After two full bags, I’m moving on. The Siamese started scratching more and had soft stools, and the Maine Coon put on a pound even with a kitchen scale and strict portions. The kibble leaves an oily film on the gravity feeder, and I’m wiping the tray daily. The bag’s reseal strip split the third time I closed it, so I had to transfer everything to a bin.",
        "source_5": "Just talking packaging and freshness: my 10 lb bag arrived with a tiny pinhole near the seam. The zip closure worked once, then misaligned and let air in. By the second week, the top layer felt stale and my cats waited for scoops from deeper in the bag. I ended up pouring the rest into an airtight container to keep it from softening.",
        "source_6": "As an overall choice for a two-cat household, this has been workable. We do 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. feeds; the Siamese’s tear staining looks lighter and both nap through the afternoon instead of prowling. Cost per pound is higher than what I used before, but they seem to need slightly smaller portions. The only nuisance is the strong aroma when the bag opens, so I store it in the garage between refills."
