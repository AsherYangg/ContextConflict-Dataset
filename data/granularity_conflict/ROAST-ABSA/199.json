        "source_1": "I just got back from a week at Breezes and it honestly felt like the best holiday yet. Check-in took ten minutes, we were in Building 3 with a balcony facing the water, and housekeeping kept the room tidy without ever waking us up early. I spent most mornings on the beach—plenty of shade huts even after 10 a.m.—and wandered to the pool bar for pineapple slushies in the afternoons. We did three of the restaurants, and the Mexican spot stood out for me: they were pressing tortillas right at the entrance, and the chicken mole had a deep cocoa note that paired well with the smoky salsa. The nightly shows ran on time, and the salsa lesson before “Fiesta” ended up being the running joke of our trip because my two left feet finally found a rhythm.",
        "source_2": "Only here to talk about the Mexican restaurant at Breezes. We booked a 7:30 p.m. slot, showed up on time, and still waited about forty minutes to be seated. The chips on the table were warm but limp, the guacamole came out under-seasoned, and the carne asada had that boiled texture instead of a proper char. Our server was juggling too many tables, so refills took forever, and my margarita tasted more like melted ice than lime. We bailed before dessert and grabbed late-night snacks elsewhere.",
        "source_3": "I focused on the room at Breezes because I like an afternoon nap, and the AC made it tough. In 2415 the unit rattled like a box fan on a loose shelf; maintenance came twice and tightened a panel, which helped for a few hours, then the noise crept back overnight. Water pressure in the shower was strong, but hot water fluctuated around 8 a.m., so I switched to evening showers. The mattress leaned firm with a ridge in the middle, and the blackout curtains left a one-inch gap that let sunrise hit me right in the eyes. If you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs and a sleep mask.",
        "source_4": "As an overall stay, Breezes didn’t quite click for us. We arrived with two kids and stood in the check-in line for about 45 minutes while they processed a large group. The first room had a damp smell; they moved us the next day, which helped, but we lost half a morning repacking. The beach had seaweed windrows for three of our six days, and while they were cleaning, the tractor noise started around 7 a.m. Wi‑Fi was solid in the lobby and shaky in our building, so remote work calls had to happen on a couch near the piano. We liked the coffee stand and the omelet station at breakfast, yet dinners felt uneven—Italian night was memorable, but the buffet theme night missed the mark.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on activities: Breezes nailed it. The entertainment team ran beach volleyball at 11, water polo after lunch, and a goofy foam party by the shallow end that somehow got even my dad dancing. The archery range opens at 3 p.m. with a short safety brief, and the staff actually coaches you into tighter groupings instead of just letting you fling arrows. At night we caught the “Viva México” show—live mariachi, costume changes, and audience participation—but the real gem was the 4 p.m. tequila and salsa class in the Mexican restaurant foyer. I spent almost no time in the room because the daily schedule kept pulling me out.",
        "source_6": "We tried the Mexican restaurant twice and had two very different meals. On Tuesday, the al pastor tacos were stacked with pineapple and charred edges, and the server rolled a cart over to mix a spicy guac right at our table. On Friday, same order, but the pork came lukewarm and the tortillas tore on the first bite. The hostess said a large wedding party had backed up the kitchen that night. If you can, aim for earlier seatings; when we went at 6 p.m., courses flowed, and the churros arrived hot with a thick chocolate dip."
