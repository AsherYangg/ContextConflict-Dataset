        "source_1": "I bought this specifically for the taste and brewed one bag at 175°F for about two minutes. The liquor came out pale gold, and the first cup didn’t lean grassy at all. There’s a faint lemon thread that shows up right at the finish, enough that I skip sweetener. I’ve paired it with a simple rice bowl a few evenings and it doesn’t clash; even a second steep stayed clean without that spinach-y edge I’m used to from some greens.",
        "source_2": "I focused purely on flavor over several tries—160°F for a minute, 170°F for two, and a cold brew in the fridge overnight. No matter the method, the cup carried a lawn-clipping vibe I couldn’t shake, and the lemon read more like perfume than peel. My tongue felt a little tight after each mug, and I ended up cutting it with a spoon of agave just to finish the glass.",
        "source_3": "Looking at it as my everyday iced tea, I run four bags through a 64 oz electric iced tea maker. The pitcher comes out clear, with a gentle lemon note that lets me skip adding wedges. The box has a foil inner wrap that keeps the leaves aromatic between uses, and the per-bag cost sits comfortably within my weekly grocery budget. I keep a batch in the fridge and it’s what I reach for when guests drop by.",
        "source_4": "Judging the whole purchase, the carton showed up dented and the inner sleeves were partly open. During brewing, two bags tore along the seam and left sediment in the carafe, so the iced tea turned murky. The lemon tasted more like candy flavoring than zest, and after a couple attempts I set the remaining bags aside and went back to my usual setup.",
        "source_5": "I pay attention to the finish more than the first sip. With a three-minute steep, the cup went down smoothly, but the aftertaste stuck around like copper with a squeeze of lemon. Shortening the steep helped a little, yet that lingering note stayed present for a good half hour, which doesn’t work for me before morning calls.",
        "source_6": "On afternoons when I want something lighter than coffee, I brew a bag at around 170°F for 90 seconds. The body stays light, the citrus keeps it lively, and I can go through two mugs without the jittery edges I get from stronger blends. It also takes well to a splash of honey over ice for a late-day refill in my travel tumbler."
