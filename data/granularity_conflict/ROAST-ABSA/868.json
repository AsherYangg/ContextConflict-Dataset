        "source_1": "I upgraded from a two-year-old flagship and this feels upscale the moment you open the box. The satin back has a nice grip, the polished frame doesn’t dig into my palm, and the haptics make typing satisfying. I moved everything over with the built‑in migration tool in under 20 minutes. The main camera handled a weekend trip—food shots at a café looked crisp, and the ultrawide didn’t warp buildings. The display is easy on the eyes for long reads, and streaming a late‑night movie showed deep shadows without crushing detail. For what I paid, it doesn’t come off as compromised anywhere I care about.",
        "source_2": "I bought it specifically for photos, but the camera behavior indoors keeps tripping me up. At my niece’s birthday in a dim restaurant, the shutter consistently hesitated, and half the candles ended up smeared. Faces look overly smoothed even with “beauty” toggles off, and skin tones lean gray under warm lights. Night mode needs several seconds, which turns kids into streaks. The 2x crop is fine for menus and signs, but the telephoto hunts on stage performances. Daylight shots are okay—leaves and brick textures are sharp—but once the sun sets, I take out my older phone because it gives me more predictable results.",
        "source_3": "I’m super picky about screens, and this one checks most boxes. Outside at noon, Google Maps stayed legible without squinting, and auto‑brightness ramped up fast when I stepped out of the car. Scrolling news at 120 Hz feels steady, with no ghosting on text. In Netflix, HDR highlights pop without blowing whites, and darker scenes keep detail in hair and fabric. I also don’t notice color shift when tilting the phone—blues and reds stay consistent edge to edge. After two hours of reading in bed at low brightness, I didn’t get that flicker fatigue I’ve had on other phones, so it’s now my go‑to e‑reader.",
        "source_4": "I had a tiny crack in the SIM tray after two weeks, and the support journey soured me on the brand. Chat sent me to email, email sent me to a “partner center,” and the center said the issue looked like “impact damage” even though the phone lives in a case and hasn’t been dropped. I provided photos and timestamps, but the ticket bounced around for 18 days with no resolution. The store kept my device for inspection, then told me to pay for a replacement tray. I’ve owned multiple phones from this company and expected a straightforward warranty process; this one left me second‑guessing future purchases.",
        "source_5": "As a daily driver, it’s been a mixed bag for me. The glossy sides pick up micro‑scratches, and the slab feels top‑heavy—one‑handed use on the train is awkward. The software skin adds duplicate apps and pushes promotional notifications that I keep chasing through settings. Video calls warm the top right corner, and the back gets clammy during longer sessions. The camera nails daylight but struggles with neon signs at night, turning them into halos. At low brightness, I see a faint green cast on gray backgrounds. I paid close to flagship money, and between the bloat and the quirks, I’ve started eyeing a leaner alternative.",
        "source_6": "I’ll zoom in on battery because that’s my main use case. With 5G on, 120 Hz enabled, and a mix of Slack, Spotify, and Maps, I’m landing around 6.5–7 hours of screen‑on time. By 8 p.m., I’m usually under 15% and hunting for a plug. Overnight drain with Wi‑Fi and background sync sits near 7%, which adds up on travel days. There’s no charger in the box, and my 30W PD brick takes about 75 minutes from 10% to full. On a weekend photo walk, the battery dropped faster when I used portrait mode and video; carrying a power bank has become part of the routine."
