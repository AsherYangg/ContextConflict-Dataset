        "source_1": "I took this course over two weekends and it pulled me into the catalog in a way I didn’t expect. The lectures that walk through Rubber Soul and Revolver helped me hear inner voices and arrangement choices I’d always missed, like the guitar countermelody under the chorus of Norwegian Wood and the way the harmony pivots in Eleanor Rigby. The listening guides nudged me to build a playlist and follow along with timestamps, so by the time the Abbey Road medley came up, I could track how the motifs reappear across “You Never Give Me Your Money” and “Carry That Weight.” I kept pausing to jot down beat counts and then going back to try them on my own guitar.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor’s delivery: the pace felt like a sprint. I kept the player at 0.75x because new terms (plagal cadence, modal mixture, pedal point) flashed by on slides crammed with text and were gone in a few seconds. On Week 2, he moved from early Merseybeat rhythm patterns to studio-era orchestration in under five minutes without a breather, so I was rewinding every 30 seconds and taking screenshots just to keep up. Without chapter markers inside the videos, finding the part on the “She Loves You” handclaps took me several scrubs, and the end-of-module Q&A barely addressed any of the posted questions.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on assessments: the listening quizzes use quick clips that sometimes blur the distinctions they ask for. One Week 3 quiz had two nearly identical live vs. studio snippets of “She Loves You,” and the question didn’t specify which version; I picked the mix with louder crowd noise and still got it marked wrong. Another item asked for the key of “I Want To Hold Your Hand,” but the clip cut in mid-phrase, and the answer bank included both keys the class discussion mentioned. The auto-grader also docked me twice because I didn’t use the exact phrasing (“double-tracked vocals” vs “vocals doubled”), and the peer-graded essay had wildly different standards—one reviewer wrote two sentences, another left detailed bar-by-bar notes.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, I expected more score-level analysis and less timeline recap. Several segments linger on milestones like the Ed Sullivan appearance and the Shea Stadium setup, while dense musical moments—like the rhythmic layering in “Tomorrow Never Knows” or the voice-leading through “Because”—get a quick mention before moving on. The capstone ended up being a reflective piece rather than a structured analysis with notation, and the discussion forum leaned into personal memories over musical breakdowns. I finished the syllabus but was still hunting for a deeper dive on harmony and form in the later years.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on one instructional moment: the breakdown of chord substitutions in “Something” and the modulation trick in “Penny Lane” finally clicked for me. He plays the passage on guitar, then mirrors it on piano while pointing to the pivot tones, and lays the form out as verse–bridge–tag with bar counts. Hearing him isolate the bass movement under the “very strange” section of “Penny Lane” and then drop it back into the full mix made it easy to hear in context. I bookmarked those segments and rewatched them during practice to internalize the movement.",
        "source_6": "On production quality alone: captions are a few seconds out of sync in multiple Week 3 videos, which makes following the musical terms tricky if you rely on subtitles. The audio sometimes leans to the right channel, so isolated examples on piano feel lopsided on headphones, and a couple of song excerpts clip at the start as if the fade-in was cut off. There aren’t downloadable transcripts with timestamps, and when my connection hiccups, Coursera reloads the video at the beginning instead of where I left off, so finding the spot where he demonstrates the drum pattern in “Ticket to Ride” takes extra time."
