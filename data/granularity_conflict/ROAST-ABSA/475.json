        "source_1": "I’m writing this just about the stairs. I arrived with a 23 kg suitcase and a carry-on, and my room was on the third floor. There’s no elevator, so it was three flights up, roughly 50 steps by my count. The hallway is narrow, so I had to stop twice to let other guests pass, and turning the big suitcase on the landings was awkward. After a day of walking the city, climbing back up felt like a workout. If you have a heavy bag or bad knees, getting to and from a top-floor room takes planning.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the staff only. It’s a family operation: the mother checked me in and offered a map with bus routes marked, the son helped carry a grocery bag up the stairs, and the father arranged a 5:30 a.m. taxi for my flight. They remembered my name on day two and set aside extra tea bags when I mentioned I drink tea at night. When I left before breakfast hours, they packed a small bag with a yogurt, an apple, and a croissant without me even asking.",
        "source_3": "Three-night stay, overall impression. My room faced the courtyard and stayed quiet after 10 p.m. The bathroom had space to spread out toiletries and a walk-in shower that didn’t flood the floor. The desk fit my 15-inch laptop comfortably, with an outlet right beside it, so I got a couple of hours of work done each evening. Breakfast was included, which meant I didn’t spend extra at cafes; I had a plate with bread, cheese, a boiled egg, and coffee each morning. There’s no elevator, and I was on the third floor, but with a backpack instead of a suitcase it wasn’t an issue for me.",
        "source_4": "Just here to talk about the included breakfast. It covered the basics but felt sparse: sliced bread, jam, a few slices of cheese and ham, and a push-button espresso machine. The boiled eggs were gone by 8:30 two mornings in a row, and it took about 15 minutes before more appeared. The juice tasted like concentrate, and fruit was limited to a bowl of green bananas on one day and a couple of small apples the next. If you’re counting on variety, you might end up grabbing something else afterward.",
        "source_5": "Overall take from a two-night visit. I was put in room 303 on the top floor, and with no elevator, getting my suitcase up the narrow staircase was a hassle at check-in and even more so at a 6 a.m. checkout when no one was at the desk. The motion-sensor lights in the stairwell flicked off mid-descent once, and I had to wave my arm to get them back on while balancing the bag. The room itself had a large bathroom and a compact desk that fit my laptop, and the included breakfast saved me a few euros, but the repeated climbs to the third floor dominated the experience."
