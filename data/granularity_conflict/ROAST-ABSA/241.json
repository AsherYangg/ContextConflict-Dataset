        "source_1": "I first picked these up during a work trip to Melbourne, grabbing a 200 g pack at Woolworths on Collins Street. With a flat white, the outer biscuit gave a clean snap and the center was soft without being runny, a combo that made the long afternoon meetings feel shorter. I now toss two sleeves into my carry-on when flying back to the States; my team raids my desk within an hour. On my last visit I also grabbed Cherry Ripe bars, but these cookies are the ones I hunt for first at the grocery.",
        "source_2": "Texture only: once the sleeve was opened, the shell went from crisp to chalky in under an hour. The edges stayed firm, but the middle softened and the layers separated when I tried to break a cookie in half. Crumbs covered the table, and the filling started to tug like taffy against my teeth.",
        "source_3": "Filling only: the cocoa center is smooth and melts cleanly, no waxy film. There’s a faint malt note that shows up after a few seconds, and it spreads evenly all the way to the edge so every bite gets some of it.",
        "source_4": "Sweetness level only: two bites felt syrupy, and I reached for water right away. Sugar leads the flavor, with not much salt or bitterness to balance it, and the sweetness lingers for several minutes.",
        "source_5": "I ordered two packs shipped to California (about $12 each). Seals intact, but the aroma was muted, and the taste leaned heavily on sugar with a light cocoa whisper and a hint of artificial vanilla in the finish. The bite started crisp but the cookies felt a bit stale after the first day, so I gave the second pack to a neighbor. For comparison, I’d pick up Cherry Ripe when I want a stronger chocolate hit.",
        "source_6": "On trips to Sydney I grab these at Coles when they’re on a 2-for-$5 promo and serve them with black tea after dinner. The contrast of the snap outside and soft middle works well, and they pair nicely with ice cream when guests drop by. The only hitch is the thin packaging—once opened, they lose their edge quickly—so I now move the rest into an airtight jar."
