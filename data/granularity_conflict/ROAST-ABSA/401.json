        "source_1": "I bought the six-box bundle expecting a bright lemon zing over a gentle green base, but every cup I brew at 180°F for about 3 minutes leans hard into ginger with a grassy lemongrass edge. The liquor stays pale and the green tea feels muted, almost like background noise. Even with a teaspoon of honey, the dominant note is still ginger, and I can’t pick up much true citrus—more herbal than lemon peel.",
        "source_2": "As an overall take, this has become my evening routine tea. I steep one bag for 2–3 minutes at around 175°F, add a drizzle of honey, and it gives a warm ginger glow that settles my throat after long meetings. The aroma from the packet reads lemony to me, and I like that the cup doesn’t come across as bitter or tannic. I went through two boxes in a month because I drink it after dinner, sometimes with a splash of lemon juice if I want extra brightness.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on the “lemon” part of the name: I was chasing that sharp, citrus-oil character you get from real lemon peel. With this, I mostly taste lemongrass—soft, herbal, and a little hay-like—without the tart sparkle I associate with lemon. I tried hotter water (near boiling) and a longer 4–5 minute steep to see if the lemon would pop, but it stayed mellow and grassy rather than zesty.",
        "source_4": "My concern is only the green tea presence. I brewed side by side with a plain sencha bag at 170°F for 2 minutes, and the sencha had that unmistakable steamed-vegetal aroma and light astringency. This blend, by itself, feels thin on the green tea signature. To get what I want, I drop in a second bag of plain green tea under the same water, and then the cup finally shows a proper green backbone under the ginger.",
        "source_5": "I stocked a box in our office kitchen and noticed people reaching for it mostly when they had scratchy throats. General feedback from coworkers: ginger-forward, not much actual lemon, and the green tea is hard to detect unless you brew two bags. A slice of fresh lemon transforms it, but straight out of the sachet the name on the carton led a few folks astray. I ended up keeping most of it at my desk for those afternoons when I want warmth more than a classic green taste."
