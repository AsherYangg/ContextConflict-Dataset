        "source_1": "I’ve taken a few front‑end classes, and this one stands out for how it bundles Bootstrap basics into the first three weeks. By the end of week 3, I rebuilt my portfolio landing page using the grid, responsive nav, and cards without leaning on the sample code. The examples scale cleanly from mobile to desktop, and the instructor calls out common layout pitfalls. I’d only tweak a couple of the animation demos, but as a package for Bootstrap, it felt cohesive and practical.",
        "source_2": "I jumped in without the preceding “first course” and kept hitting missing context. In week 2, terms like “media object,” Sass variables, and basic flex utilities are referenced as if we already covered them. The project rubric points back to prior patterns I hadn’t seen, so I paused the videos constantly to read external docs and watch YouTube clips. If you skip the earlier part of the sequence, expect to spend extra time filling gaps.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on assignments and grading only: the weekly tasks largely ask you to re‑create a provided mock with starter code and a CDN link. There’s minimal work from a blank file, and the auto‑grader seems to check for class names over behavior. My week‑3 submission passed even though the navbar collapsed awkwardly on certain tablet widths. Quizzes lean on definition recall; I finished most in under five minutes using notes.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, this course actually got me shipping something. I put together a two‑page site for a local club by following week‑1 through week‑3 and then adjusting the card layouts and spacing. The pacing is steady—videos run 6–10 minutes—and forum replies landed within a day for me. I do wish there were a single capstone that forces a design from zero, but the structure still pushed me to produce a usable result.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on production quality: several lectures in week 1 (modules 3–4) have peaky audio, and the captions trail by a second or two. Code snippets occasionally mix Bootstrap 4 and 5 conventions—.form-group shows up, then later examples switch to g‑* spacing classes. I ended up pinning the CDN to 4.6 so the samples matched the behavior on my screen.",
        "source_6": "As an overall takeaway, I could assemble pages with the provided components, but stepping outside the templates was rough. Exercises rarely ask you to debug tricky breakpoints or restructure layouts without the starter kit, so when I tried to implement a custom header and nonstandard grid, I stalled and had to seek material elsewhere. If you’re aiming for deeper layout reasoning rather than catalog use, plan on supplementing this course."
