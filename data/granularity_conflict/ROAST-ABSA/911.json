        "source_1": "I’m obsessive about cleanliness, so the first thing I did was pull back the duvet and inspect the corners of the sheets and the piping on the pillows. The duvet was crisp with no spots, and the drapes looked recently steamed—no discoloration along the hem where dust usually collects. I even ran a damp wipe along the window sill and it came up clean. Housekeeping swapped towels and refreshed the bath mat each afternoon without me having to call.",
        "source_2": "Noise is my make-or-break factor. I had a street-facing room on the 10th floor overlooking the Walgreens sign, and the double-paned windows kept things surprisingly hushed; I could hear a faint murmur when sirens passed, but it never jolted me. Hallway chatter died down after 10 p.m., and the HVAC fan on low created a steady whoosh that made it easy to sleep. I didn’t touch the earplugs I brought.",
        "source_3": "I booked specifically for the spa tub, and that part let me down. There was a thin crack near the drain that you could feel with your palm, and the edge felt rough enough that I didn’t want to soak for long. The glass shower door also didn’t track smoothly; it shifted and scraped, and maintenance tightened a hinge but it loosened again by the next morning. Water pooled near the threshold because the seal didn’t sit flush.",
        "source_4": "I did a two-night stay for an anniversary weekend and came away pretty impressed with the whole setup. Our corner suite felt roomy, with an L-shaped sofa, a long desk for our laptops, and plenty of space to open two carry-ons without playing furniture Tetris. Check-in took three minutes, and someone brought extra towels and tissues within ten minutes of my app request. The bed had a supportive mattress, we slept in both mornings, and the city skyline view at sunset was a highlight.",
        "source_5": "For a one-night work trip, the room layout felt tight; with my roller bag open on the floor, there was barely a path between the bed and the wall. The tissue box was empty when I arrived, and I ran out of toilet paper around 2 a.m.—called the front desk twice before someone picked up. Street noise carried up to my floor, and the view was straight into the Walgreens sign and a busy corner where people were shouting late. The shower door wobbled on its hinge, which made me nervous stepping in and out."
