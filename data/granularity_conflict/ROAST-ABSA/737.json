        "source_1": "I first stumbled onto this tea while living in London and it quickly became the one I reached for most mornings. With freshly boiled water, a 3–4 minute steep gives a deep copper cup that carries a malty backbone without a bite, and it stays steady whether I drink it plain or with a splash of milk. Back in the U.S., it’s hit-or-miss to find; an import shop in Chicago had it on a lower shelf, but otherwise I’ve asked friends overseas to send a couple of boxes at a time so I don’t run out.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on strength: I bought this as an everyday breakfast option, but even at a full rolling boil and a 6-minute steep, the body stays on the lighter side for me. The liquor looks right, yet the cup feels thin unless I double up bags or leave it in until it turns overly tannic. For comparison, other black blends I drink hit the mark at 3–4 minutes with one bag; this one needs extra coaxing to deliver that heft.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on smoothness: I’m sensitive to astringency, and this is one of the few black teas I can drink straight without that dry, puckery finish. I brew at around 205°F for 4 minutes and get a clear, rounded cup with soft malt and a hint of toast that doesn’t rough up the palate. It’s gentle enough that I can sip it on an empty stomach, and even a 5-minute steep doesn’t produce that harsh edge I brace for with similar blends.",
        "source_4": "Looking strictly at build and packaging quality: my last order had several tea bags split at the seam, leaving fine dust all over the wrappers and inside the tin. The leaves themselves were quite powdery, which made the brew cloudy and left silt at the bottom of the cup. Flavor varied between boxes—one batch smelled bright and fresh, the next seemed flat out of the packet—so consistency has been a question mark.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after a month of daily use: this leans toward a punchy profile that extracts fast—at the 3-minute mark it’s already inky and needs a dash of milk to keep it from running rough. It gives a jolt that’s great for early meetings, but I switch to something milder in the afternoon or I end up a bit wired. Availability wasn’t an issue for me; a small international grocery in Seattle keeps it near the register, which makes grabbing a replacement box easy.",
        "source_6": "Flavor and aroma only: on the nose I get warm malt and a faint biscuit note, and in the cup there’s a clean, toasty character without much fruit or floral complexity. It pairs well with a shortbread or a splash of oat milk; sugar tends to flatten it, so I skip sweetener. This isn’t a “special occasion” tea in my cupboard—more a dependable cup when I want predictable flavors and a straightforward brew."
