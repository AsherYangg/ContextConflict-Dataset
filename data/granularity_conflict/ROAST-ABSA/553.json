        "source_1": "I focus almost entirely on flavor accuracy with Jelly Belly. I buy the 3 lb assortment so I can mix and match: two Toasted Marshmallow with one Chocolate Pudding tastes exactly like a s’more, and Green Apple with Cinnamon gives a warm pie vibe. The texture is consistent—thin snap on the shell, then a clean chew—and I rarely get repeats clumped together. I sit with my kids and do blind tastings; they can pick out Juicy Pear versus Watermelon by aroma alone. I don’t care what bundle it ships in as long as the mix includes Buttered Popcorn and Cappuccino, because those pair beautifully for a late-night snack.",
        "source_2": "I’m in Calgary and tried to use a promo email for a “buy 2 get 1” mix pack. Added the exact link from the email to my cart, and at checkout Amazon told me, “This item can’t be shipped to your selected address.” I tried three sizes (10 oz, 2 lb, and a variety box) and got the same message. Customer service suggested a local retailer, but the email’s SKU—down to the colorway on the bag—doesn’t exist here. I even changed my address to a friend’s in Toronto to test it, and still no luck. Getting these emails with glossy photos and a countdown timer, then hitting a wall at checkout, feels like being invited to a party where the door won’t open.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, ordering through Amazon.ca has been smooth for me in Vancouver. I sent the 1 kg clear jar to my dad for Father’s Day; it arrived in two days with Prime, the beans were glossy and separate (no clumps), and the gift note printed correctly. He spent the afternoon sorting flavors into little bowls during the hockey game, which made the whole gift land perfectly. The price per kilogram is higher than the bulk bins, but the reliable delivery and sealed jar make it easy to gift without worrying about stale candy or store trips.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on packaging: the zipper seal on the 2 lb resealable bag hasn’t held for me. The track misaligns after a couple of opens, and air sneaks in. After a week on the counter, I noticed the outer shells getting matte and some beans turning hard at the ends. I had to pour everything into a mason jar with a gasket to keep the texture I like. If the seal worked properly, I wouldn’t have to repack every time.",
        "source_5": "From a brand-wide perspective, the email marketing and regional availability are out of sync for me in Montreal. I get weekly messages about seasonal mixes—birthday cake confetti one week, cocktail-inspired beans the next—and every link routes me to a US page with a banner that says it isn’t eligible for my location. The cart lets me add items, but the final step blocks shipping. I’m fine paying duties or a small surcharge; I just want the option. Being shown limited-time drops with a ticking clock, then finding there’s no path to purchase here, makes the whole relationship with the brand feel lopsided."
