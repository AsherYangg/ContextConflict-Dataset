        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the screen, and after a week of reading ebooks at night I noticed the auto-brightness stepping up and down every few seconds, which is distracting in a dark room. At around 20–30% brightness, whites lean warm and darker scenes in Netflix look washed out rather than deep. There’s also a slight green tint when you tilt the phone off-axis, and the glass picks up reflections outdoors, making it harder to read in sunlight unless I crank brightness. Scrolling in Instagram feels smooth most of the time, but occasionally there’s a micro-jitter when the UI is busy.",
        "source_2": "Using it as my daily phone for three weeks, the size sits comfortably in my hand and the back finish looks sleek enough for office use. I did run into a freeze while switching between Google Maps and Messages, and once the launcher restarted after I cleared all apps. The camera handles daylight scenes fine, but indoor shots under warm lights look soft and skin tones shift. Recording a 1080p video for about 20 minutes made the top of the phone warm to the touch, and the single speaker gets drowned out in a noisy living room.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the camera: daytime street photos come out detailed, but as soon as clouds roll in, the sky shows grain and edges lose crispness. In a dim restaurant, the autofocus hunts for a second or two and the shutter introduces blur if someone moves even slightly. Portrait mode does decent separation on shoulders, yet hair strands near the ear often get clipped. Video stabilization smooths walking, but panning causes a wobble, and the front camera’s skin processing is heavy-handed.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on performance: I don’t play games, but I juggle WhatsApp, Gmail, Twitter, and Chrome with a dozen tabs. Switching back to Chrome after viewing a photo in WhatsApp sometimes reloads the page, and the keyboard lags for a split second when I jump between apps quickly. I’ve had two “App not responding” pop-ups in a week while scrolling long threads, and the notification shade drops frames when there are many alerts. After a minor update, the general snappiness improved a bit, though those hiccups still appear under heavier multitasking.",
        "source_5": "Heat behavior has been noticeable for me during longer sessions. A 45-minute Zoom call over 4G made the area near the camera bump warm enough that I shifted my grip. Playing BGMI at default graphics for about 15 minutes led to a few frame drops and a warm back panel, especially around the top-left. Charging while navigating with Google Maps amplifies the warmth, and the phone takes a few minutes to cool down once I stop.",
        "source_6": "Battery life in my routine: starting at 100% at 8 a.m., two hours of YouTube on Wi‑Fi, an hour of Instagram, and roughly 40 minutes of calls, I’m around 35% by 8 p.m. Screen-on time averages about five hours with brightness around 60%, and overnight standby drops roughly 8–10% with notifications enabled. Outdoors at 80% brightness, maps and camera usage cause the percentage to fall quickly, and I’ve plugged in by late afternoon a few times if I’m out and about."
