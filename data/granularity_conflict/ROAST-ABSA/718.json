        "source_1": "I ran into a big issue with the peer review setup on Week 3’s project: only two classmates evaluated my submission, and one clearly misread the rubric and marked me down for “no sources” even though I had an annotated bibliography on the last page. That single score pulled my overall assignment from 92% to 71%, and there wasn’t a straightforward way to request another reviewer or have the outlier tossed. The comments were just one-liners with no examples, so it was hard to figure out what to improve. If the course required at least four reviewers per assignment or automatically down-weighted outliers, this kind of mistake wouldn’t carry so much weight.",
        "source_2": "My experience with the peer review was surprisingly smooth: for each assignment I received feedback from three classmates plus an optional fourth if I submitted early. The rubric had clear criteria—structure, evidence, and clarity—and most reviewers referenced specific sections of my work (“intro paragraph,” “methods table”) when scoring. One reviewer did give an odd score on Week 2, but the median kept it from swinging my grade, and the flagging tool let me ask for a second look. The detailed comments helped me fix a citation format and tighten my conclusion before the capstone.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, the course was structured in a way that fit my schedule: short videos (10–15 minutes), a weekly mini-project, and a capstone that tied everything together. The instructor used case studies and checklists that I ended up applying in a client proposal two weeks later, especially the outline template from Module 4. The discussion prompts actually got me drafting in smaller steps instead of waiting until Sunday night, and the reading list had links I saved to my notes app. Peer review took some coordination, but the step-by-step rubrics kept the process manageable.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, I struggled with how scattered the content felt—several lectures repeated points without diving into the “how,” and a couple of links in the readings were dead. The assignment instructions were broad, so different reviewers interpreted the rubric differently; on the Week 1 task, I received comments that contradicted each other about what counted as “analysis.” The forum was quiet, which made it hard to get clarification before the deadline, and I ended up spending more time guessing expectations than building the skills I signed up for. The grade weight on peer reviews amplified that uncertainty, since an off-target score had real impact.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on just the course materials, the transcripts and slides were tidy and easy to follow, with examples broken down into steps—model, draft, revise—so I could mirror the process in my own work. The instructor’s “before and after” samples in Module 2 made it clear what changed and why, and the downloadable checklist turned into my template for later assignments. I built a small portfolio piece using the framework from Week 3 and got useful feedback from a colleague outside the class, even before submitting for peer review. The lectures didn’t assume specialized background, which made it straightforward to pick up and apply."
