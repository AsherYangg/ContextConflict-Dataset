        "source_1": "I took this as my first security course and it ramped up smoothly from secure coding basics to threat modeling. The instructor used short demos to show input validation flaws, and the lecture on attacker goals helped me frame risks, not just memorize terms. I finished the quizzes and two case-study projects without hiccups, fit the schedule around a full-time job, and rolled straight into the next course in the specialization.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the testing setup: most checks are auto-graded multiple-choice, and the single peer-graded project arrived late in the syllabus. I kept hoping each week would include a small build-and-review task—something like writing a quick authentication flow and defending the design—because the quizzes sometimes rewarded checkbox thinking over actual application.",
        "source_3": "Only commenting on the projects: the secure design review of a chat app and the mini-penetration test on a sample forum were the highlights. The rubric forced me to map data flows, list assets, and document attack surfaces before proposing mitigations. Peer feedback flagged an overlooked password reset vector in my design, which sent me back to tighten session handling—easily the most useful part of the course for me.",
        "source_4": "From an overall perspective as a backend dev with a couple of years’ experience, the content read like a survey. The threat modeling portion skimmed examples I’ve seen in internal brown-bags, and the assessments leaned on recall rather than building, testing, and breaking things. I was hoping for weekly labs with fuzzing, code review of vulnerable snippets, and more rigorous grading based on working artifacts.",
        "source_5": "Zooming in on the threat modeling module: the section on adversary capabilities and STRIDE finally gave me a repeatable checklist. I built a quick data-flow diagram for a mock payments service, identified spoofing and tampering points around the webhook endpoint, and used the provided template to document mitigations. That template ended up in a design doc I circulated at work the next day.",
        "source_6": "Taking the course as a whole, the production quality was solid—videos under ten minutes, transcripts clean, and the forum responses from peers were quick when I got stuck on the week 2 exercise. I got a lot out of the hands-on parts that were included, though I kept wishing for more frequent project work to replace some of the lighter quizzes. Even so, it set me up well to continue with the specialization."
