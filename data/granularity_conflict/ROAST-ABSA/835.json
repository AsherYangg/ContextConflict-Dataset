        "source_1": "I stayed three nights and used it as a base for sightseeing. The Aerobus dropped me at Plaça Catalunya, and from there it was an easy walk with a roll-aboard. Check-in took about five minutes, and the person at the desk handed me a city map and circled a few tapas spots around the cathedral. My room on the fifth floor was quiet with double-glazed windows, the bed took up most of the space but felt supportive, and the shower had steady water pressure. After a day at the museums I went up to the rooftop; the pool is small, but I cooled off and grabbed one of the few loungers. I skipped the hotel’s breakfast and wandered to a café two blocks away each morning instead.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on cleanliness because that’s what stood out on my stay. When I pulled back the duvet, there were a couple of short dark hairs on the sheet, and the bathroom sink had a long strand across the basin. The bedside shelf was dusty enough to leave a fingertip line, and there was a sticky spot by the desk chair that my shoes kept catching on. Housekeeping swapped the towels but didn’t seem to run a vacuum—crumbs stayed near the wall for two days. Even the corridor carpet outside my door had a splash mark that didn’t budge the entire weekend.",
        "source_3": "My experience was all about the front desk, and not in a great way. I arrived around noon and happily left my bag when told the room would be ready at three. I came back at 3:30, and they couldn’t locate my luggage for a solid half hour; the person on duty kept tapping at the keyboard without really explaining what was going on. I called down twice in the evening to ask for an extra pillow and eventually got one close to 11 p.m. The night receptionist barely looked up when I asked about airport transport schedules, just slid a brochure across the counter with no clarification. The housekeepers I passed in the hall were kind, but the desk interactions set the tone for the stay.",
        "source_4": "I chose this place mainly for the rooftop pool and ended up disappointed. It’s more like a plunge basin than a swimming pool—two strokes and you hit the wall—and there were only four loungers, all occupied most of the afternoon. The water felt chilly in early June, and there’s no real shade, so the tiles were hot underfoot. A group of kids were playing Marco Polo in the small space, which made it hard to relax. It also closed earlier than I expected (a sign said 7 p.m.), so the post-dinner dip I imagined never happened. The bar by the terrace was shuttered both evenings I tried.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the location cut both ways for me. Being a short stroll from the cathedral and La Rambla made sightseeing easy, but my street-facing room picked up every burst of laughter from the square and the bin lorry at dawn. Church bells started early, and even with the window shut, I could hear them clearly. The mattress in my room had a dip in the center, so my partner and I rolled toward each other all night and woke up stiff. It’s handy for transit and cafes, no question, yet I found myself wishing for thicker glass and a flatter bed by the second morning."
