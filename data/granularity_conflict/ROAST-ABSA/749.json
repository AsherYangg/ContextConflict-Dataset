        "source_1": "I pulled several shots on a Gaggia Classic Pro with 18g in a 58mm basket, aiming for 36g out in about 28–30 seconds. Even after trying lower temperature and a longer pre-infusion, the cup leaned roasty with a slight ashy tone and a drying finish. I kept waiting for a cocoa echo, but what stuck around was more of a smoky edge and lingering bitterness.",
        "source_2": "On my Breville Barista Express, a 17g dose to 34g yield at 27 seconds produced a silky shot that went down easy. The first sip was mellow, and the tail end had a clear cocoa note—closer to dark chocolate than milk chocolate—which stayed pleasant when I turned it into a cortado. I didn’t pick up any char in my cup.",
        "source_3": "I bought the pre-ground bag for the office since nobody wants to drag a grinder in. The grind fit our 54mm portafilter without fuss, and it’s convenient for quick morning cappuccinos. The valve bag arrived with a roast date printed, but after a week of opening and closing, the reseal struggled and the aroma dropped off; shots started tasting flatter compared to day one. For convenience, it’s easy, but you need to move through the bag fast or portion it into airtight jars.",
        "source_4": "Focusing strictly on grind behavior: the particles look fine enough for espresso, but there’s a noticeable mix of fines and larger bits. On my Rancilio Silvia with a VST basket, I kept getting channeling—one spout racing, the other dribbling—even with careful distribution and a calibrated 30‑lb tamp. Puck inspection showed pinholes, and the shot times swung from 22 seconds to over 35 without changing dose. It feels like the pre‑ground size makes dialing in tricky.",
        "source_5": "As an everyday drinker who rotates between café shots and home lattes, I tried this side by side with a Starbucks dark roast. In straight espresso, this one came across cleaner, but once I added milk, the Starbucks shot pushed through with a caramelized bite while the Lavazza got quieter. My spouse actually missed that burnt edge they’re used to, so our latte mornings split: they reached for Starbucks, I stuck with this for straight shots.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on strength and after‑effects: a double shot (18g in, 40g out) had a dense body that hit hard. I usually drink espresso before meetings, but this left me jittery and the finish felt heavy on the palate. In milk, the intensity mellowed, yet taken neat it was a bit much for me at 7 a.m.; I had to switch to smaller singles to keep it manageable."
