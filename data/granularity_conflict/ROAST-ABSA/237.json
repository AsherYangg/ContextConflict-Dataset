        "source_1": "I picked up the bacon-flavored Kong paste to stuff our two medium Kongs, and the tube has been tricky. The tip crusts over between uses, so the first squeeze tends to burp air and shoot a blob past the opening of the toy. Twice it smeared on the outside of the Kong and left a sticky ring on the rug when the dog rolled it. I’ve started using a toothpick to clear the nozzle and a silicone mat under the dogs when I fill them, but even then the paste can string like taffy and end up on their paws.",
        "source_2": "I focus on how our three dachshunds react: the moment they hear the cap twist, they sprint from the other room. A thin spiral inside the small Kongs keeps each one occupied for 15–20 minutes, which is perfect during thunderstorms. I keep the tube in the fridge so the paste firms up a bit and doesn’t ooze out too fast; it stays put in the toy and they methodically lick the inner walls clean. No crumbs on the floor, and I can wipe the nozzle with a damp paper towel and toss the toys in the top rack afterward.",
        "source_3": "Overall take after two tubes: convenient but with trade-offs. The ingredients panel reads more like a dessert than a daily staple, so I use a pea-sized ring and top with their regular kibble. My lab will chase a large Kong for half an hour, but if I go heavier than a thin layer he gets gassy later that night. Cost-wise, one tube gave me about 8–10 fills for a large Kong, which felt short given the price. The last inch is hard to squeeze out cleanly, and I end up cutting the tube to scrape it with a butter knife.",
        "source_4": "Narrow note on digestibility: my senior beagle doesn’t handle this paste well. Even with a tiny smear the size of a fingernail, he had loose stools the next morning. The vet thought it might be the richness or sweeteners, so we tried spacing it out and pairing with his usual bland diet—same result. Swapping to plain pumpkin in the Kong solved the issue immediately, so the paste seems off-limits for his stomach.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture view from crate training and travel: the peanut butter flavor has been handy for fast setups. I smear a thin ring just inside the rim with the tube tip, press a couple of small biscuits deeper, and the crate door closes without a fuss. On a 6-hour road trip, the tube rode in a side pocket with the cap snapped on; no leaks or oil spots in the bag. I store it upright and give the nozzle a quick twist of a paper towel after each use, and the paste hasn’t dried out or clogged under that routine."
