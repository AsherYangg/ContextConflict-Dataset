        "source_1": "I took Dr. White’s neuroscience course while juggling a full class load and a part-time job. The weekly modules were dense but structured: video lectures, short readings on ion channels, then a problem set that built on the examples. I leaned on the transcripts to rewatch the section on membrane potentials, and the practice quizzes before the midterm mirrored the style of the graded ones. By the final week, I could trace how a stimulus travels through a simple circuit, and the pacing—though heavy—kept me from falling behind.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor: The lectures often felt like a race through crowded slides. In the unit on synaptic transmission, he switched from receptor types to second messengers without showing an intermediate example, and the Q&A replies were usually a single sentence with a link instead of a walkthrough. Office hours were scheduled at a time that made it hard to attend from the East Coast, and the midterm debrief was posted several days after the grades, so I couldn’t use it to fix mistakes before the next assignment.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on workload/difficulty: I signed up with zero neuroscience background and spent about 8–10 hours each week. The challenge helped: the Hodgkin–Huxley simulation notebook forced me to play with parameters until the spike shape made sense, and the problem set where we estimated firing rates from raster plots finally clicked after a long Saturday. I kept a running cheat sheet of terms, and by week five I could explain the Nernst equation to a classmate without peeking at notes.",
        "source_4": "Overall take: The content coverage is wide, but the sequence sometimes jumps. Week two introduces reversal potentials before laying out the math, and the peer-graded project rubric didn’t match the examples shown in the lecture. I finished the course, but I had to watch extra YouTube primers to connect the topics, and the group discussion felt quiet except for a few threads near the deadlines.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on the instructor: Dr. White consistently grounded abstract concepts in stories from his lab—his example tracing a patient’s temporal lobe seizure through network activity stuck with me. He posted short Friday check-ins summarizing common confusions, and on my capstone he left time-stamped notes like “revisit your threshold assumption at 03:12,” which made it clear what to fix. Even when I posted at odd hours, I usually saw a forum reply within a day, with a pointer to a specific slide or time marker in the lecture."
