        "source_1": "I took this right before a two‑week trip to Shanghai and kept the app open on my phone the whole time. The short role‑plays—buying metro tickets, asking for directions, ordering dumplings—mapped directly to situations I ran into. The instructor models a phrase, breaks it down into chunks, and then runs a quick drill; by the time I landed, I could greet the hotel staff, tell a taxi driver my destination, and ask how much something costs without resorting to English. It doesn’t go deep into grammar or character writing, but for getting through transit, restaurants, and shops, the scripted dialogues and pronunciation tips were enough to function day to day.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the materials: the slides and PDFs are laid out cleanly with pinyin, characters, and a literal gloss side by side, and the audio is recorded by multiple native speakers with adjustable playback speed. I liked that every example sentence has a clickable transcript, and the on‑screen tone marks are color‑coded, which made reviewing on the train practical. The downloadable vocab sheets are printer‑friendly, and the end‑of‑video summaries list exactly which phrases and patterns were introduced, so it’s easy to build personal flashcards.",
        "source_3": "I’m preparing to live in Beijing for a semester, and the scenarios didn’t match what I need. There’s a lot on airport check‑in and hotel front desks, but barely anything on renting an apartment, setting up a bank account, or talking to a university office—situations I’ll actually face. The dialogues lean heavily on tourist interactions, and the sample conversations stop right where real life gets messy, like when someone answers with a follow‑up question that isn’t in the script. I left feeling ready for a vacation, not for everyday life.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the title led me to expect a pathway into the language, but most of the time is spent on set phrases with minimal explanation of how to assemble my own sentences. After finishing, I could order food and ask prices, yet I struggled to handle simple small talk beyond the scripts because I never learned how the pieces fit together. Characters are mostly optional, so reading menus or street signs remained out of reach. If you’re aiming to build a foundation for broader study, you’ll likely need another resource alongside this.",
        "source_5": "Only commenting on the quizzes: they drill the key items from each session effectively. The listening sections test tone discrimination with near‑minimal pairs (ma1 vs. ma3), and the matching exercises reinforce measure words and sentence order. I appreciated the immediate feedback that highlights the exact syllable I misheard, plus the spaced review that resurfaces earlier phrases in later weeks. By the third week, the number and time expressions stuck because they kept reappearing in short, timed quizzes.",
        "source_6": "Strictly on presentation quality, I ran into issues: several captions were a beat out of sync, making it hard to shadow the speaker; a few pinyin spellings in the PDFs didn’t match the audio; and some lesson pages used tiny character fonts that were tough to read on a phone. One of the Week 2 audio clips had noticeable background hiss, and two external practice links returned 404 errors. These glitches broke the flow and made self‑study less smooth than it could be."
