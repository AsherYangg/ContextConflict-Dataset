        "source_1": "I bought both the 21 oz bottle and the 10-pack of single-serve packets to compare costs for my meal prep business. The bottle was $14.99 when I ordered, so about $0.71 per ounce. The 10-pack worked out to $18.90 for roughly 10 ounces, or $1.89 per ounce. With Subscribe & Save on the bottle, my second order dropped to $12.74, which brought it close to $0.61 per ounce. Even after adding sales tax, the bottle beat the packets by a wide margin. I logged the prices over three weeks and the delta held, so I switched my recurring order to the bottle and refill small squeeze tubes for portioning.",
        "source_2": "I use this as a weeknight shortcut—two tablespoons whisked into Greek yogurt makes a quick dip, and a splash over roasted vegetables adds a nice finish. The 21 oz bottle lasted me just over a month with four to five uses per week, and the flip-cap hasn’t leaked even when it gets shoved sideways in an overstuffed fridge. I like that it doesn’t overpower grilled chicken, and it blends smoothly into pan sauces without breaking. The outer label wipes clean easily, which matters because my kids grab it with messy hands, and the neck doesn’t crust over if I give it a quick wipe after each pour.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on taste only: I found it noticeably sweet with a lingering syrupy note that sticks around after the first bite. Even after vigorous shaking, it pours thinner than I expected and separates on the plate, leaving a glossy sheen on the surface of the food. On roasted potatoes it masked the herbs, and on cauliflower it brought out a metallic edge that reminded me of canned glaze. I tried cutting it with vinegar to balance things out, but the sweetness still led the way, so I relegated it to occasional use on burgers where the bun can soak it up.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on pricing: the cost swings a lot week to week. I paid $17.49 for the 21 oz bottle in July, but it dropped to $13.29 the next week—too late for a price adjustment. At my local warehouse club, a comparable 24 oz bottle is $9.79 any day. The 10-pack of singles looks convenient, but at nearly two dollars a packet the per-ounce rate is steep, and Subscribe & Save didn’t apply to the singles when I checked. Between the volatility and the per-ounce premium on the packets, I felt like I had to keep watching the listing rather than just reordering.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: shipping was quick and the bottle arrived shrink-wrapped with a tamper ring intact. I waited until mine ran empty to chime in—took about six weeks of steady use on salads, rice bowls, and a couple of slow-cooker meals. The wide mouth makes it easy to measure, but the flow can be sudden; I learned to squeeze gently or it floods a dish. The flavor holds up in heat, which made it useful for meal prep, and the pantry life was solid with no off smell near the end. I’d keep one in the door of the fridge for general use, and I refill a small travel container to keep at my desk for lunch."
