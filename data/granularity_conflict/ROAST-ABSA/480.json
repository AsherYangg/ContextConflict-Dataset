        "source_1": "I set this up for my dad (4GB/64GB variant) and spent an afternoon stress‑testing it. Updated to MIUI 13.0.8, turned off “msa” and app recommendations, and installed WhatsApp, GPay, Paytm, YouTube, Chrome, Maps, and Facebook Lite. With 10–12 apps in the background, the dialer pops up right away, app switching is fluid, and the camera opens from the lock screen in about a second and a half; shot‑to‑shot time is under a second in daylight. I even recorded a 20‑minute 1080p clip, then jumped into Maps and it didn’t choke. No freezes in five days of uptime.",
        "source_2": "After three months as my daily driver, I’m comfortable with it overall. Calls on Jio VoLTE are clear, the earpiece is loud enough on the metro, and the speaker handles podcasts fine. I disabled a few preinstalled apps and ads on day one and it stopped nagging me. It holds Wi‑Fi well in the far room, and I haven’t seen random reboots. The last OTA arrived in July; the phone installed it overnight and booted cleanly. For the price I paid (₹9,499 at a local store), it’s been dependable for banking, UPI, WhatsApp, and maps during weekend rides.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the camera launch behavior: my unit hesitates on the first cold start. Right after a reboot, the camera takes around 8–10 seconds to appear from the lock screen; subsequent launches drop to 2–3 seconds. Clearing the camera app cache brings it down to ~2 seconds for a day or two, then it creeps back up. Low‑light autofocus hunts for about a second before locking; daylight is fine. If I launch via double‑press power, it’s slightly faster than via the on‑screen icon.",
        "source_4": "Strictly about battery life: I get 6–7 hours of screen‑on time with 120 minutes of YouTube over Wi‑Fi, 45 minutes of Google Maps navigation, an hour of WhatsApp calls, and constant Bluetooth to a OnePlus Buds Z. Standby drain overnight is 1–2% in airplane mode and 3–4% with dual‑SIM on. Charging from 15% to 100% with an 18W adapter takes about 1 hour 55 minutes; the phone gets warm near the camera module for the first 20 minutes then cools down. No sudden drops at 30–20%; the percentage ticks down steadily.",
        "source_5": "I bought this for my mom, who only calls and watches YouTube, and it still drags on simple actions. The dialer sometimes freezes for 3–4 seconds before the keypad shows up, notifications arrive late, and the camera can take 12–15 seconds to open if it hasn’t been used for a while. I factory‑reset, updated to 14.0.1, and kept only a handful of apps (Phone, Messages, YouTube, WhatsApp), but the hiccups returned within a week. Even taking a quick photo of a parcel at the door becomes a wait, so I’m looking at swapping it for a higher‑tier model."
