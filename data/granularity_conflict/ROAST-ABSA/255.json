        "source_1": "I booked Casablanca because it’s steps from Times Square, but the location wore me down fast. From mid-afternoon until well past midnight, drumlines and sirens bounced off the buildings on W 43rd, and the sidewalks felt like a parade route every time I tried to reach the 42 St–Times Sq station. Rideshares took two or three passes to find me thanks to tour buses stacking up along the block. Even with the curtains drawn, neon bled around the edges, and I could still pick up honking in the room around 2 a.m.",
        "source_2": "My stay was made by the people at the front desk and Rick’s Cafe. Maria checked me in a couple of hours before the posted time, walked me through a map of nearby theaters, and printed my off-Broadway e-tickets when my phone was dying. In the evenings, Kevin at the cafe remembered my name and set aside a spot near an outlet so I could catch up on emails while sipping the complimentary tea. When I asked about a late checkout, the desk tagged my key and arranged luggage storage without any fuss, then recommended a quiet route to Bryant Park that avoided the Times Square crush.",
        "source_3": "As an overall stay, mine felt rough around the edges. Room 403 was tight, with the bed pushed nearly against the wall, and the in-window AC rattled whenever it cycled on. The single elevator backed up around breakfast, and the cafe area was so packed I ended up standing with a plate balanced on my laptop bag; the espresso machine was out of order one morning. I requested extra pillows after the first night and they arrived about 40 minutes later, just as I was heading out. Being able to walk to my show was convenient, but by checkout I was counting the minutes to quieter space.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about noise, so I asked for a quiet room in my reservation notes and got one facing the interior on the 6th floor. The windows were clearly double-paned, and between that and the heavy blackout curtains, I slept straight through a Friday and Saturday without hearing the hallway or the elevator ping. There was a small white-noise machine on the nightstand, but I didn’t need to turn it on. For a spot so close to Broadway, the room felt tucked away.",
        "source_5": "For a two-night visit, Casablanca worked well as a home base. Check-in took five minutes, I dropped my bag, and within ten I was walking to an off-Broadway show on 9th Ave; the next morning I strolled to Bryant Park for coffee before meetings. The staff in Rick’s Cafe kept refilling my cup and pointed me to a couple of low-key restaurants on 44th that weren’t mobbed. My room faced the back, and I slept through the night without hallway chatter waking me. Checkout was quick, and they held my luggage so I could squeeze in one more matinee."
