        "source_1": "I booked it because it’s steps from La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter, but being “right out the door” also meant late-night street noise, chanting soccer fans, and delivery trucks at 5 a.m. Even with the windows shut, buskers’ amps and crowd chatter carried into the room. The two nearby metro stations were handy, though one entrance was under renovation and the detour required crossing a busy boulevard with luggage. Morning coffee runs were easy, yet getting uninterrupted sleep was a challenge. If you plan to work early or turn in before midnight, the location makes that tough.",
        "source_2": "I chose it for the “clean and simple” vibe, focusing on the room. At first glance the surfaces looked fine, but the shelf behind the bed had dust buildup and there was a stray hair on the bathroom tile. Towels had a faint bleach smell, while the shower grout showed dark patches that didn’t go away after one service. Housekeeping knocked daily, yet they didn’t replace the small bin liner unless I asked. For a two-night stay it was tolerable; I kept toiletries in my bag rather than on the counter.",
        "source_3": "As a budget traveler, I zero in on what you get for the rate. My room had thin walls, no kettle, and no lift, and reception needed to loan out a hairdryer. Walking to sights shaved off transit costs, but earplugs and bottled water became extra purchases with no mini-fridge or filter available. Curtains let in light from the corridor, and there wasn’t a proper desk. Counting features per euro, this felt sparse compared to other places I’ve used in shoulder season.",
        "source_4": "I spent three nights using it as a home base and was mostly out exploring. Check-in was smooth, the staff pointed me to the two metro lines nearby, and I could reach the cathedral in under five minutes. The room was minimal—bed, small desk, clean sink—and that’s all I needed for a city-heavy itinerary. I asked for an interior-facing room and slept without interruptions. For me, the location and straightforward setup matched what I wanted.",
        "source_5": "I focused on the hotel’s “simple” setup and found it very stripped down. No artwork, plain tile floors, a small window, and white linens gave it a bare look. Storage was limited to an open rack with two hangers, so my suitcase stayed on the floor the whole time. There was no chair, so the bed became the only place to sit, which isn’t ideal if you need to work or eat in the room. Travelers with more than a carry-on may find the minimal layout inconvenient.",
        "source_6": "My partner and I stayed over a weekend and took in the area’s energy. Street performers gathered outside and crowds lingered late, while hallway voices carried through thin doors. The bathroom tap ran lukewarm at peak hours, and the air unit cycled with a noticeable hum. Walking to La Rambla and the Gothic lanes was convenient, but by Sunday we were piecing together rest with daytime naps. Next time we’ll trade proximity for calmer nights and a couple of added in-room features."
