        "source_1": "I stayed here for three nights during a conference and the whole visit ran smoothly. The front desk had me checked in within minutes, handed me a city map, and circled the U-Bahn stops for my sessions. Breakfast downstairs covered the basics and then some—fresh rolls, cheeses, cured meats, fruit, muesli, and hot items that were replenished while I was there. I could walk to KaDeWe in about 3 minutes, then continue down Tauentzienstraße toward the zoo for an easy morning stroll. I’d pick this place again for my next trip to Berlin.",
        "source_2": "My take is only about the breakfast buffet. I went down around 8:45 on two mornings and kept finding empty trays—scrambled eggs gone, no fruit left, and the pastries tasted like they’d been out a while. The self-serve coffee machine jammed twice and a line formed behind it, with one staffer trying to fix it while also clearing tables. As someone avoiding dairy, the labeling was patchy and I couldn’t find a clear non-dairy yogurt or milk option. After 30 minutes of circling, I ended up grabbing a pretzel at the bakery across the street.",
        "source_3": "I booked this hotel mainly for its location, and it delivered for a shopping-focused weekend. KaDeWe was literally around the corner—2 minutes tops if you hit the lights—and Kurfürstendamm started just a short walk further. The zoo entrance by Hardenbergplatz took me about 10 minutes at an easy pace. Transit was effortless: U-Bahn Wittenbergplatz is steps away and buses 100 and 200 got me to the Brandenburg Gate and Museum Island without fuss. I didn’t need a taxi once.",
        "source_4": "My review is strictly about service. Check-in took 25 minutes because only one person was staffing the desk while a line snaked into the lobby. Our room wasn’t ready at 2:15, and the travel crib we requested arrived nearly three hours later after two follow-up calls. Housekeeping skipped our floor one day, so we had to request fresh towels in the evening. To be fair, the night manager did bring extra pillows and a kettle promptly after I asked at 10 p.m.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression, the hotel met the basics but the “central” claim felt overstated for my needs. With a stroller and a suitcase, crossing wide intersections and waiting at lights made the walk to KaDeWe closer to 12 minutes, and the zoo took nearly 20 because of construction detours. Reaching Museum Island required multiple transfers and took about 35–40 minutes door to door. The room faced a busy street and I could hear buses until late, and the elevator was slow during morning checkout rush. Given the logistics, I’d probably pick a place nearer to the sights I was visiting next time."
