        "source_1": "I only cared about the pool on this trip, and I ended up using it every afternoon after the beach. Even though it’s compact, the water was crystal clear by 7 a.m., and the attendants kept a stack of fresh towels on the rack. The sun hits the deck around 2–5 p.m., so I could warm up after a dip, and there were always a few open loungers. I watched maintenance test the water with strips each morning from the balcony. For a quick rinse-off swim before dinner, it did the job nicely.",
        "source_2": "I booked this place because it listed a pool, and I focused my stay around that. The pool is tiny, tucked between tall buildings, and it stayed in the shade most of the day, which made the water chilly. There was a sharp chlorine smell, and a loose tile by the steps flexed under my foot. With just a few families in it, the space felt crowded, and there’s no view—just walls. I used it once and then walked over to Hilton Village for the rest of my swims.",
        "source_3": "I’m all about the final bill, so here’s the breakdown I had in August: $119 per night base, plus a $25 amenity fee and taxes, came to $476 total for three nights. Hilton Village quoted $329 per night for the same dates, before their resort fee. I skipped parking and breakfast add‑ons and walked eight minutes to their stretch of sand each morning. For Waikiki, that price gap let me put the savings toward poke and a sunset sail instead of room charges.",
        "source_4": "My notes are strictly about cleanliness. On arrival, the bathroom sink had dried toothpaste flecks, and the TV remote was tacky. There was fine sand along the baseboards and a faint mildew smell from the shower grout. The sheets looked fresh, but the bed skirt had a dark scuff near the corner. Housekeeping swapped towels and wiped the vanity when I asked, yet the grout odor lingered, so I cracked the lanai door to air the room out each evening.",
        "source_5": "Five-night stay with my partner, and we used the place as a launchpad rather than a resort. Check-in took under five minutes, they held our bags after checkout, and our courtyard-facing room stayed quiet at night. We grabbed coffee downstairs, walked 10 minutes to Hilton Village daily, and caught buses on Ala Moana for day trips. The room felt tidy, the pool worked for a quick dip, and the rate left enough in our budget for plate lunches and a catamaran ride off Waikiki.",
        "source_6": "I did a weekend getaway and came away with mixed feelings overall. The advertised rate looked low, but the amenity fee and taxes pushed a $125 room close to $170 a night. Street noise seeped through the balcony door, elevators were jammed at check-in, and the pool area felt cramped and shaded. Staff were kind, yet with the extra charges and tight common spaces, I ended up spending most of my time over at Hilton Village and only returning here to sleep."
