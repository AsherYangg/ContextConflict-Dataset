        "source_1": "I’m fixated on aroma, so I always judge a new cereal by that first whiff. When I opened this bag, the scent rushed out like a roasted-nut candle—loud and lingering—and it stuck to the kitchen for hours. After a couple of bowls, I started sealing the inner bag with a clip because the smell kept creeping into the pantry and into my coffee mug sitting nearby.",
        "source_2": "My notes here are only about texture in milk. With 2% milk straight from the fridge, the flakes kept their edges for about two minutes, then collapsed into soft clumps by minute four; with oat milk, the slump was even faster. I tried a second bowl with less milk and a quicker spoon, and still ended up with a pasty layer at the bottom that felt like wet paper.",
        "source_3": "Dialing in sweetness is my main concern. The first few bites come across like a light sugar dusting, but halfway through the bowl I noticed a syrupy film in the milk and a lingering candy-like taste on my tongue. I now mix it 50/50 with an unsweetened bran cereal just to keep the aftertaste from piling up.",
        "source_4": "For an overall take: I went through a box over a week of early meetings, and it fit easily into my routine. The flakes are airy enough that I don’t feel weighed down, and they keep a gentle crunch even after I’ve stepped away from the bowl to answer an email. The toasted, nut-like note shows up without shouting, and a sliced banana didn’t drown it out. It also worked well as a yogurt topper where it didn’t go limp.",
        "source_5": "As a whole impression, it stands out from the usual aisle choices, but the “different” part lands oddly for me. There’s a husk-like aftertaste that shows up near the end of each bite, and the flakes shed a fine dust that gathers at the bottom of the bowl and needs extra milk to stir back in. After two mornings, I found myself reaching for a softer cereal because my mouth felt a bit scratched up.",
        "source_6": "I bought it specifically for a strong nut vibe, so I focused on that aspect. The box and name hint at a deep, nut-forward profile, but in the bowl it leans more toward toasted grain than actual nut character; the aroma fades fast after opening. I ended up tossing in chopped pecans to get the flavor I expected, which tells me the “nutty” note here is more background than center stage."
