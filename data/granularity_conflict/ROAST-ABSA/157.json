        "source_1": "Focusing on texture only: I opened two pouches from the same case and both poured out as a thick stew that held a mound in the bowl rather than spreading like water. When I pressed a spoon through it, the chunks stayed intact and didn’t dissolve, and the broth clung to the meat instead of pooling. It reminded me of a loose pâté with gravy, not a runny soup. I even sliced a portion with a butter knife to see if it would slump—edges stayed neat.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on palatability only: My 3-year-old tabby, Luna, usually sniffs and walks away from new flavors, but with this one she jogs to the kitchen as soon as she hears the pouch tear. She laps the broth first and then drags the shreds to one side of the bowl, finishing everything within a couple minutes. I’ve served it at breakfast for three weeks, and she leaves nothing but a clean dish and a little gravy smear. No coaxing, no toppers, just straight from pouch to bowl.",
        "source_3": "Overall impression: I keep this flavor on hand because my senior cat needs extra fluids after a UTI. The broth makes it easy to get moisture in without adding water, and it mixes well with her prescription kibble—no clumping. The smell is mild compared to some fishy varieties we’ve tried, and the pouch tears cleanly along the notch so I don’t end up with a mess. After a month, her weight held steady, stools stayed normal, and she seems comfortable with it as a daily dinner.",
        "source_4": "Batch consistency focus: I’ve bought this flavor three times now. The first shipment in May was thin with fewer visible pieces of meat, mostly broth; the July reorder from a different lot code (stamped along the top seam) was noticeably thicker with more shreds. I grabbed a single pouch from a local store to compare, and that one matched the thicker July batch. So, it looks like the texture can swing between runs, which might explain why some folks see “soupy” and others don’t.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression: My two cats wouldn’t touch this after multiple tries—morning, evening, and even after a long play session when they’re usually eager to eat. The contents slid out like a watery gravy with small strands, and after ten minutes the liquid had separated around the rim of the bowl. I warmed it slightly and stirred, tried mixing with their usual BFF tuna-and-chicken flavor, and offered smaller portions on a flat plate; still left untouched, and I ended up tossing half the case."
