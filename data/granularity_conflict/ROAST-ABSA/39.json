        "source_1": "We booked four nights for our anniversary and the place set the mood right away: lantern-lit paths, a hammock on the balcony of our garden-view room, and quiet early mornings where we could hear the palms rather than people. The entertainment crew—Rey, Frankin, Mariel, and Rosemary—ran beach volleyball and trivia that felt playful without being pushy, and they even taught a short salsa class before dinner. We ate mostly seafood and Caribbean dishes; the grilled snapper with lime and the plantain sides stood out, and breakfast had ripe mango and an omelet station that remembered my order by day two. We took the half-day catamaran to the reef, spotted a few parrotfish, and drifted back in time to watch the sun drop behind the pier, which capped off the couple’s vibe we wanted.",
        "source_2": "I’m weighing in only on the food. Over five dinners the buffet felt repetitive—stewed meats showed up in slightly different sauces, and several dishes leaned oddly sweet. Twice the fish on the carving station was lukewarm by the time I got to it, and at the steakhouse my medium-rare request arrived grey throughout. The bakery counter at breakfast was the bright spot with flaky croissants and guava turnovers; otherwise the house wine tasted thin, and I switched to local beer after the first glass. If dining variety matters to you, plan on the à la cartes early or you’ll face long waits.",
        "source_3": "My review is strictly about the entertainment staff. Rey, Frankin, Mariel, and Rosemary were everywhere in the best way—pool aerobics at 11, darts after lunch, then a salsa lesson that had even the shy folks moving. They learned names, checked on my mom’s knee after she sat out a game, and when afternoon showers hit, they pivoted trivia to the lobby lounge without missing a beat. On my partner’s birthday they surprised us with a small cake at the end of dinner, which they coordinated quietly with the waiter. Their energy carried the daytime mood, and I never felt hounded to participate.",
        "source_4": "Focused note on the excursions desk: we booked the waterfall hike and the bus showed up 40 minutes late with barely functioning AC. The guide kept a tight clock at the falls, so photo time felt rushed, and we were back on the bus sooner than the brochure suggested. The snorkel trip the next morning was canceled twice due to “boat maintenance,” and although they did process a refund, it didn’t hit my card until the day we checked out. After that, we skipped signing up for anything else because the line at the desk moved slowly, with one agent juggling a crowd.",
        "source_5": "As a whole, the grounds are lush and couples will notice the two-top tables by the pool and the beach beds draped with white fabric, but our room location hurt the calm vibe: Building 3 faces the main stage, and sound checks kicked off around 7 with music carrying past 11 most nights. Even with the balcony door shut, the bass thumped through the walls, and earplugs only did so much. Mornings redeemed it—coffee at the beach palapa with hardly anyone around—but if early nights matter, ask for a room away from the theatre and the swim-up bar side."
