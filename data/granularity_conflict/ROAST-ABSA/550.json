        "source_1": "I took the course alongside my statistics class and finished it in two weekends. The format is bite-sized videos followed by quick quizzes, and I found myself rearranging my study routine around what it suggested: 25-minute blocks, active recall, and spacing. Instead of cramming before labs, I started building small “chunks” by writing problems from memory and checking them later. The forum threads on procrastination gave me a few tactics I tested during midterm week, like setting a timer before opening RStudio and logging distractions. The overall flow felt polished, and by the end I had a repeatable plan I could carry into the rest of the semester.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on structure: the weekly modules felt rigid on my schedule. The sequence forces you through every clip before a quiz unlocks, and the frequent switches between main lectures and interviews broke my concentration. I often paused a concept video just as it was getting into an example, got sent to an interview segment, and then had trouble picking up the thread. The checklist-style progression (watch, mark complete, quiz) made it feel like a set of compliance steps rather than a continuous lesson, and I found myself opening transcripts to skim past segments just to keep momentum.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the personal examples: the interviews were the parts I replayed. Dr. Barbara Oakley talking about struggling with math in the military mirrored my own path from psychology to calculus, and the student stories about handling procrastination felt familiar. I copied one guest’s approach to \"pre-commit\" with a friend and used the memory palace idea from the Terrence Sejnowski segment to place definitions in rooms of my apartment. Even without more technical depth, those narratives gave me models I could emulate when my study plan hit roadblocks.",
        "source_4": "Zooming in on the precision of the tips: the course leans hard on strict routines—25-minute timers, avoiding passive rereads, specific sleep and exercise checkpoints. That level of detail clashed with my three-hour biology labs, where interruptions aren’t practical. The guidance to stop after each block and do a recall write-up felt disruptive in long experiments, and the daily habit checklist turned into yet another thing to manage. I ended up disabling the reminders and loosening the rules to fit my workflow, which meant I had to reinterpret a lot of the guidance on my own.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture judgment: I went in after reading a few books on study skills, so spacing, chunking, and the focused/diffuse modes were already familiar. The lectures summarized those ideas clearly, but the quizzes were mostly recognition-level and rarely pushed me to synthesize across modules. The assignments amounted to reflecting on a plan rather than building something substantial, and I didn’t find new material beyond what I’d seen in podcasts and articles. I completed everything, but I relied on the discussion boards for deeper scenarios, like how to adapt these techniques to proof-heavy courses.",
        "source_6": "Single-aspect view on math-related content: I joined hoping for more concrete math strategy demos—worked proofs, step-by-step problem breakdowns, and targeted practice sets. The course mentions techniques (recall, chunking, spaced repetition) and briefly gestures at math examples, but the exercises stayed generic. There weren’t walkthroughs of, say, epsilon–delta proofs or integration substitutions that show how to apply the methods under time pressure. I had to look outside the course for detailed math practice to pair with the study advice."
