        "source_1": "I treat these as an everyday snack, not a novelty. I keep a bag in my desk drawer for the 3 p.m. slump and another in my hiking pack. The savory seasoning actually scratches the same itch as chips, and the portions are right-sized so I don’t plow through the whole bag in one sitting. The Sea Salt and the Chili Lime packs went first in my household, and I’ve reordered the variety box twice because it keeps me from defaulting to vending-machine stuff on long workdays.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on texture only: the pieces start with a firm snap and then collapse into a powdery paste that clings to my molars. After a few bites, it feels like damp cardboard packing peanuts—light but oddly dense once it hydrates in your mouth. I tried letting them sit on my tongue first and also tried chewing faster; either way, the mouthfeel turns me off before I can finish a serving.",
        "source_3": "I bought these strictly for the macros. One pouch fits neatly into my lunchbox and gives me a tidy protein bump without wrecking my carb count. The label on mine shows 12g protein, 3g net carbs, and around 140 calories per bag, with sodium comparable to jerky. The ingredient list is short, nothing I had to Google, and it’s easy to log in MyFitnessPal. For road trips and flights, they’re a clean, packable option that doesn’t melt or get crushed.",
        "source_4": "I went through the sampler over a weekend to see if this would replace my usual savory snacks. The first bag was intriguing, but by the third, the smell hit me as soon as I opened it—like something from the pet aisle—and the taste stuck around long after I was done. I ended up tossing half a pack and giving the rest to a coworker who’s into paleo-style snacks. The concept sounded right up my alley, but I couldn’t get past the experience.",
        "source_5": "I’m here for the flavor, full stop. The Sea Salt & Vinegar has a sharp tang that pairs well with cut cucumbers, and the Umami flavor reminded me of roasted seaweed and miso—deep, toasty, a little briny. I ate an entire bag while watching a game and wished I’d grabbed a second. If they ever do a black pepper or smoked paprika version, I’m in, because the seasoning blends are what set these apart for me."
