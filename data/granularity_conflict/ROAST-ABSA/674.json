        "source_1": "I came in with two years of JavaScript plus plenty of HTML/CSS from front-end work. Week 1 had me install Ruby 3.2 with rbenv on macOS Sonoma, set up bundler, and get PostgreSQL running via Homebrew. By the end of Week 3 I had rails new working, generated a scaffolded blog, and deployed it locally. The progression—environment, Ruby fundamentals, then Rails—fit together, and the examples aligned with each step, so I never felt lost jumping between terminal and editor.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on how the lessons are presented: the videos keep the code editor and terminal visible the whole time, and the instructor types commands live so you can follow along without guessing. Captions match the code lines, and the downloadable notes list exact gem versions and commands. The segment on blocks uses color-coded highlights to show yield vs. return and where scope changes. I used the transcript on my commute and could still keep pace when I sat down to code later.",
        "source_3": "Zooming in on the examples only: they lean heavily on toy projects. The blog scaffold doesn’t cover authentication, background processing, or anything beyond localhost. When I tried to extend the sample to include image uploads, there was no mention of Active Storage or validations for file types, so I had to hunt through guides and Stack Overflow. If you’re looking for a production-style case study with deployment and testing strategy, that piece isn’t in the examples.",
        "source_4": "The Ruby basics week felt crammed. It tries to cover arrays, hashes, blocks, modules, and basic RSpec tests in a few lessons. I kept stopping to figure out symbol vs. string keys in hashes, how enumerables chain with lazy evaluation, and what “duck typing” implies in method design. Exception handling is touched briefly without getting into custom error classes or rescue hierarchies. I ended up pausing every few minutes to read the Ruby docs before moving on.",
        "source_5": "Environment setup on Windows was rough. The course mentions WSL but most steps assume macOS paths. I started with rbenv inside Ubuntu, switched to rvm after OpenSSL build errors, and ran into bundler complaining about Ruby 3.2 mismatching Rails 7.1. PostgreSQL refused to start due to a port clash with Docker Desktop, and I had to tweak service configs before rails db:setup worked. Matching the instructor’s setup took two evenings and a lot of forum posts.",
        "source_6": "As a complete newcomer to programming, I felt out of my depth in Week 2. The instructor builds a small CLI and uses blocks and iterators without much time spent on what variables, loops, or classes look like. I was constantly looking up operators like << versus + and how instance variables differ from local ones. By Week 3 I could run the Rails scaffold and see a form in the browser, but I didn’t really understand what conventions the framework was handling behind the scenes."
