        "source_1": "I’m picky about the peanut itself, so I bit through the glaze and paid attention to the center. The nuts had a clean roasted aroma when I opened the bag, and the peanut inside broke with a crisp snap instead of that soft, mealy crumble you sometimes get. I didn’t catch any waxy or old-oil notes, and the aftertaste stayed nutty rather than metallic. I even tried a handful alongside black tea, and the peanut flavor held up without getting drowned by the coating.",
        "source_2": "I zero in on the sweet-to-salty balance because I watch my sodium. On my tongue, the salt leaned heavy—visible crystals along the surface and that lip-tingle that sent me reaching for extra water. After two handfuls, the peanut flavor felt sidelined by the salinity, and I found myself scraping the glaze with my teeth just to bring the nut forward. If you prefer a restrained salt finish, this tilt might be distracting.",
        "source_3": "I care most about the coating thickness, and here it sits on the lighter end. The glaze is thin enough that it doesn’t gum up my teeth or leave sticky fingers, so I can snack at my desk and still type without smudging the keyboard. Breaking a piece in half shows a whisper of caramel around the peanut rather than a thick shell, which keeps the bite from feeling heavy. It’s closer to a translucent sheen than a candy shell.",
        "source_4": "As an overall snack, it worked well for our midweek movie night. I set out a bowl next to apple slices and seltzer, and the kids kept circling back for refills. The peanuts stayed crunchy from the first handful to the end of the bag, and the glaze didn’t leave streaks on the couch throw—even the youngest didn’t end up with sticky hands. We finished the bag by the credits without anyone complaining about off flavors.",
        "source_5": "I bought two bags for a small get-together and had mixed results. The first bag poured out fine, but the second had several pieces with a flat, tired taste, like the nuts had been sitting next to something oily in storage. A few clusters were stuck together with uneven coating, and some peanuts were soft instead of crisp. I picked through to find the better ones and ended up tossing a portion because guests started avoiding that bowl.",
        "source_6": "I focus on the caramel note, and mine skewed toward a darker, almost burnt edge. On a couple of pieces, the glaze hardened into sharp fragments that took effort to bite through, and the sugar stuck to my molars longer than I’d like. That deeper roast in the coating pulled attention away from the peanut, and I found myself sipping coffee between bites to clear the palate."
