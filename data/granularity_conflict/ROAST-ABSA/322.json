        "source_1": "I took the course during my commute and wrapped it up in three weeks. The sequence from a quick big-O refresher into graph search and then dynamic programming felt consistent, and the programming tasks matched what was shown. The Dijkstra assignment in particular forced me to think through edge cases like zero-weight edges and disconnected nodes. I ended up adapting the final project template to build a small route planner for my team at work, so the material translated nicely beyond the lectures.",
        "source_2": "Only commenting on the lecturers’ visuals: the slides leaned heavily on text with very few diagrams. When BFS was introduced, they narrated queue updates but didn’t animate the frontier or color nodes, so I kept pausing to sketch the queue and visitation order myself. A simple step-by-step diagram of how neighbors are enqueued would have saved a lot of rewinds, and similar issues came up when they described backprop without showing intermediate tensors.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the lecturers’ delivery: the live tablet sketches made ideas click for me. During the shortest-path lesson, watching the min-heap evolve while distances settled helped me track the algorithm without cross-referencing notes. The pace felt even, and the way they called out invariants before each proof meant I could follow the logic in real time without pausing.",
        "source_4": "I’m only reviewing the pseudo code and written notes. The notation is consistent across weeks, with boxed loop invariants and clear pre/postconditions. The KMP preprocessing table is spelled out line by line, and the DP examples include base cases and transitions explicitly. I implemented both KMP and a coin-change solver directly from the notes in Python and only glanced at the videos to confirm a boundary case.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after reaching the midpoint: I kept losing the thread as topics jumped from recursion trees to amortized analysis with little connective tissue. Quizzes referenced symbols that didn’t appear on the slides, and the lack of step-by-step visuals meant I spent more time searching external blogs than watching. After pausing repeatedly to reconstruct pseudo code from the transcript, I put the course on hold."
