        "source_1": "I bought this for my mother because she just needs calls, WhatsApp, and YouTube, and she didn’t want anything flashy. The setup was straightforward, the interface is uncluttered, and the icons are big enough for her to find things quickly. She keeps mobile data on, watches cooking videos for an hour or two, and the phone doesn’t stutter with those basics. Charging is slow with the included brick, so she plugs it in after lunch and it’s ready by evening; last time it went from around 35% to full in roughly two hours. For the price we paid, it behaves like a no-fuss, everyday handset that doesn’t overwhelm her with features she’ll never touch.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on charging: I commute by train and rely on short top-ups, and this phone just doesn’t keep up. There’s no fast charging, and using the included 5V/2A adapter, I only gained about 14% in a 20-minute stop at a café. A full charge from 10% took me a little over 2 hours 40 minutes on multiple tries. I carry a power bank now, but even then the input rate seems capped, so the quick-boost habit I had with my previous device isn’t possible here.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on battery size and ergonomics: the battery pack makes the phone chunky and a bit top-heavy. In slim jeans, the corner sticks out noticeably, and it presses against my leg when I sit. During long reading sessions, my wrist gets tired faster compared to my older, lighter phone, and one-handed use on the bus feels precarious. I also had to buy a thinner case because my regular protective case plus this phone’s thickness felt like a brick in my pocket.",
        "source_4": "As an all-around device for work and home, it handles the basics without drama—calls are clear, messaging is quick, and watching two or three episodes on Netflix after dinner doesn’t cause hiccups. I’m not into high-end gaming or camera tricks, so the straightforward layout and minimal preinstalled apps are exactly what I needed. I plug it in at night and don’t think about it again; there’s no fast-charge animation or anything, but it’s at 100% by the time I wake up. For everyday tasks on a modest budget, it’s the kind of phone you pick up and just use without tinkering.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on battery life: the capacity feels substantial in day-to-day use. With roughly 3–4 hours of navigation each day, an hour of music streaming over Bluetooth, and light email, I end most days with around 35–40% left. On weekends with lighter use, I can stretch it into a second day without reaching for a charger. I don’t care about how fast it fills up at the wall because I’m charging less frequently overall, and the endurance is the reason I stuck with it.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after two weeks: I wanted a compact, quick-to-refuel phone for a busy delivery route, and this wasn’t it. The body feels bulky in the glove compartment and in the armband pouch, and the slow top-ups between stops forced me to change my routine. Even though basic apps ran fine, the combination of heft and long time tethered to an outlet made it hard to rely on for a fast-paced day. I switched back to my older device because it fits my pocket better and grabs a meaningful charge during a 15-minute break."
