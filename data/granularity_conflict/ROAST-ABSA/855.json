        "source_1": "I booked a club-level suite for a four-night stay and ended up spending more time in the hotel than I planned. The lounge on the upper floors became our base: breakfast with made-to-order eggs, a quiet afternoon tea with warm scones, and evening canapés with a skyline backdrop. The bay-facing bathtub was a standout—soaking while watching the city lights felt like a private show. The pool had open lanes in the late afternoons, and the gym covered my basics without leaving the property. Any small request in the lounge—extra sparkling water, a different pillow—was handled on the spot, which made the whole trip feel easy.",
        "source_2": "I’m reviewing only the fitness centre. Over three mornings between 6:30 and 8:00, two treadmills had “under maintenance” signs, the 12 kg and 14 kg dumbbells were missing from the rack, and one adjustable bench had a wobbly pin. The air felt warm once a few people started running, and the TV audio on the cardio machines didn’t match the channels. Towels ran out around 7:15 on one day and were restocked after I asked. It’s usable, but I ended up taking my last workout outdoors along the bay because the room got crowded and a bit stuffy.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on the room furnishings: the style leans heavily traditional—thick drapes, glossy wood side tables, patterned carpet. Everything was clean, but the desk drawer stuck and made a squeak every time I opened it, and the bedside lamp flickered once before settling. The armchair’s upholstery showed light pilling on the arms, and there were no USB ports by the bed, only standard outlets, so I had to run a cable across the floor to charge my phone. Engineering fixed the drawer after I called, but the overall look felt more old-world than modern.",
        "source_4": "I used the club lounge across all five daily food presentations to see what it was like at each slot. Breakfast had fresh fruit and an omelet station, though the pastries felt day-old by midweek. Afternoon tea was pleasant but fairly repetitive—sandwiches and sweets didn’t change much. The evening canapés rotated a couple of hot dishes, yet the smoked salmon and mini quiches appeared every night, and a couple of trays were lukewarm during the sunset rush. Staff were gracious but took about 10 minutes to clear plates when the place filled up, and the window seats were claimed early by guests who settled in for the view.",
        "source_5": "Reviewing just the bath view: the tub sits beside a floor-to-ceiling window facing Marina Bay, and the effect is striking. I ran a soak at 8 p.m. and watched the light show directly from the water; the privacy blind glides smoothly and stops exactly where you set it. The glass stayed clear even after a long, hot bath, and the bath salts provided a subtle citrus scent. If you’re particular about ambience, turn off the mirror lights and leave only the window glow—the skyline becomes the room’s lighting, and it feels like floating above the city."
