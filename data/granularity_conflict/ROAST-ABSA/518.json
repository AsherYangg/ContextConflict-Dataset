        "source_1": "I did the course over three weekends and felt the weekly modules built on each other in a sensible way. The first week eased in with crisis timelines, then the models and cases got progressively more technical. Andrew Metrick framed the 2008 examples with short stories that made the policy decisions feel concrete, and the assigned readings nudged me to explore topics before each lecture so I wasn’t lost. The slides were tidy, the quizzes matched what was taught, and the recap at the end of each week stitched the concepts back together without feeling repetitive.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the instructor: I watched the lectures both at 1x and 1.25x and noticed he stuck very closely to the slides, reading formula definitions without pausing to unpack the intuition behind them. When he introduced things like CDS and CLO, he moved quickly and didn’t linger on why those instruments behave the way they do, which made the examples feel more like labels than explanations. The Q&A snippets were short, and when student questions popped up about assumptions, they were acknowledged but not explored in detail.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the materials: the downloadable spreadsheets and problem sets were the anchor for me. The templates walked through NPV and WACC step-by-step, with color-coded cells and notes that explained each input, and the weekly PDF summaries collected the key equations so I didn’t have to comb through the video again. The reading list pointed to specific chapters rather than entire books, and the case briefs had timelines and balance-sheet snapshots that made it easy to follow the chain of events without getting lost.",
        "source_4": "I tried to use the discussion forum to clarify a question about translating CDS spreads into implied default probabilities, and my thread sat with zero replies for ten days. The weekly prompts felt generic (“What did you learn this week?”), the search pulled up old threads from a previous session with no clear answer, and the nested reply structure made it hard to see whether anyone had actually responded. I turned on email notifications, but sometimes I’d get a ping for a thread I didn’t follow while my own question stayed quiet, so I ended up relying on outside resources instead.",
        "source_5": "From an overall perspective as someone without a finance background, the pace can be brisk. Acronyms stack up fast—EBITDA, WACC, CDS, PD/LGD—and there isn’t a dedicated segment that breaks them down in plain language; I found myself pausing every few minutes to check definitions and rewatching certain parts. The sequence jumps from crisis case studies to theoretical models and back, which kept me interested but occasionally made the transitions feel abrupt. Quizzes are timed tightly, and I had to redo two of them after realizing I’d misunderstood an assumption buried in the slide notes."
