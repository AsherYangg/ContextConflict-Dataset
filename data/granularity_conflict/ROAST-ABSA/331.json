        "source_1": "I booked five nights at Perak Hotel in Singapore at roughly $70 USD per night. I chose a room with a skylight instead of a window; it was compact but spotless, the AC ran cold, and there was cable TV, a DVD player, and free Wi‑Fi that handled my YouTube habit without stuttering. The skylight kept the room dark and, more importantly, spared me from street sounds. Breakfast downstairs had toast, eggs, a mild curry on two mornings, and fruit; nothing elaborate, but everything got eaten. The location made exploring easy—I walked 6–7 minutes to Little India MRT, grabbed dinner at Tekka Centre, and wandered around Mustafa Centre after dark.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the buffet breakfast: I went down around 7:30 am on three mornings. The spread rotated between watery scrambled eggs or baked beans, one hot curry, white and wheat toast, jam, cornflakes, and fruit that tasted like it came from a can. Coffee was from a push‑button machine and had a powdered‑milk aftertaste. By 8:15 am, trays ran low and refills were slow, so I learned to go early. After day three it felt like the same loop.",
        "source_3": "Only about noise: My first room had a street‑facing window on the second floor. Between about 11:45 pm and 1:00 am, I heard a nearby bar rolling down metal shutters, scooters revving, and conversations bouncing off the alley. Earplugs dulled it but didn’t erase the thumps. I switched to a room with a skylight for the last night and the difference was night and day—I finally slept through without waking.",
        "source_4": "Only about the Wi‑Fi: Speed tests in my room at different hours showed 35–50 Mbps down, 8–12 Mbps up, ping around 20 ms. I ran two one‑hour Zoom calls with screen sharing, no freezes. A 500 MB upload to Google Drive took under ten minutes. The signal held on the second floor and in the breakfast area, and after the first captive login I stayed connected across devices.",
        "source_5": "Overall take as a business traveler: I was in town for meetings near Raffles Place and needed a real workspace and quiet evenings. My room had a narrow table wedged by the bed, one easily reachable outlet, and a wobble in the chair that made typing annoying. The window let in late‑night street sounds most nights, and while general browsing was fine, my company VPN crawled after 9 pm. Ride‑hailing to the CBD ran 15–25 minutes with traffic. In hindsight, I should’ve booked one of the glass‑and‑concrete chains on Orchard Road for this trip."
