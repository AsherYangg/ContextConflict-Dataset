        "source_1": "I’m only here for texture, and these Chewy Gooey megafudge cookies deliver on that front for me. Fresh out of the pouch, I can fold one in half without it cracking, and the center springs back instead of crumbling. A 6–7 second microwave pass makes the fudge streaks loosen up and the whole cookie feel like it just left a bakery case. Even the next morning after I forgot to reseal, they were pliable enough to tear cleanly rather than snap.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on texture, my pack didn’t match the name. Several cookies felt dense, with edges that flaked apart like they’d been sitting out. The chocolate pockets were firm instead of gooey, and the middle chewed more like a soft granola bar than a cookie. I tried sealing the pouch with a clip and even tossed a slice of bread in to add moisture overnight—still the same dry bend and no stretchy bite.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, the flavor landed in a middle ground for me. The “megafudge” label had me expecting a deep cocoa punch, but the taste leaned sugary with a faint cocoa note and little bursts of chocolate that didn’t spread very far. I ate two with milk and set the pack aside; later, I found the aftertaste a bit syrupy. The resealable bag is handy, but I didn’t feel drawn back to finish it and ended up bringing the rest to the office snack table.",
        "source_4": "If you’re specifically shopping for a soft cookie, this checks that box in a predictable way. I keep a pouch in the pantry for my kid’s lunchbox—one cookie stays intact without crumbling, and it’s easy to bite for smaller mouths. They don’t have any snap, so dunking in milk turns them into spoon territory fast, which is exactly what my kid likes. For me, they’re a quick late-night bite when I want something gentle on the teeth with some chocolate streaks.",
        "source_5": "From an all-around perspective, these have turned into my desk snack. The portion size is just right to take the edge off, and a quick warm-up makes the fudge threads loosen so they smear a bit on the napkin—messy in a fun way. Paired with a cold brew, the sweetness balances out, and I’ve had coworkers ask what brand they are after grabbing one. I’ve gone through a sleeve during a long afternoon without feeling like I needed a bakery run."
