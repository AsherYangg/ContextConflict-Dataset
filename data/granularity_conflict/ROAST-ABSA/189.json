        "source_1": "I track what I spend on coffee, and the sleeve I bought here was $13.50 for 10 OriginalLine capsules, which works out to $1.35 per shot before tax. The exact same sleeve on Nespresso’s site is $6.00. If I order five sleeves direct (to hit their free‑shipping threshold), I’m paying $30 total, or $0.60 per capsule. Over a month that’s the difference between roughly $18 and $40 for the same 30 shots. From a pure unit-cost standpoint, this listing is a big step up in price.",
        "source_2": "I only care about how fast I can make a cup before work, so I ordered at 9:12 pm with Prime and the capsules were on my porch by 8:03 am the next morning. When I buy from Nespresso.com, the soonest I typically see is four to five days to my address, and that’s if I plan ahead. The bump in price on Amazon is basically the fee I pay to avoid a morning without espresso. For last‑minute restocks, the speed here has been the difference between a smooth routine and a caffeine scramble.",
        "source_3": "I’m picky about freshness, so I checked the sleeve I received: lot code L310 and best‑before 05/2025 printed on the back, purchased in early March. The outer sleeve was factory‑sealed and the foil lids were tight with no dents, which is what I look for to confirm the vacuum is intact. I weighed a couple capsules out of curiosity (5.9–6.0 g of coffee each), which matches what I get from boutique orders. No crushed corners on the sleeve and no pinholes on the foils. From a freshness and packaging standpoint, this batch looked recent and well handled.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, this has been easy: the sleeve arrived in a rigid mailer, no smashed corners, and every capsule fit my Pixie without fuss. I like tossing a sleeve into the same cart as dishwasher tabs and having everything show up together, rather than juggling a separate account. The price is higher than buying direct, but I’m paying for the convenience, the quick delivery, and not having to plan a larger order just to hit a shipping minimum. Crema is consistent across the sleeve and pull times are on target for my usual 25–27 seconds, so I don’t feel like I’m trading off quality for convenience.",
        "source_5": "Taking everything into account, this listing doesn’t make sense for me: $13.50 per sleeve means my monthly coffee spend nearly doubles versus ordering a few sleeves direct and spreading them out. My box showed up without a recycling bag, two caps had small dents, and the sleeve design looked like an older print run compared to what I’ve received from the boutique recently. The shots still run, but paying a premium and seeing cosmetic issues makes me second‑guess the value. I’ll batch my orders on the manufacturer’s site again and stock a couple extra sleeves so I’m not forced into emergency buys."
