        "source_1": "I booked this place mainly for how close it is to the central station. My train pulled in at 23:40 and I was wheeling my carry-on into the hotel in under ten minutes, no taxi needed. In the morning I had a 7:05 departure; I left my room at 6:55 and still grabbed a croissant at the station bakery. The walk is flat, well lit, and easy to do with luggage. If you plan your trip around trains, the location saves time and hassle.",
        "source_2": "I stayed two nights and everything ran smoothly from the start. Check-in took about five minutes, and the front desk marked a route on a city map without me even asking. The lobby has plenty of seating and outlets, so I answered emails there while waiting for a colleague. My room on the fourth floor had a comfortable bed, a separate writing desk plus a small round table, and housekeeping had it looking fresh each afternoon. Shower pressure was steady, and the windows kept out street noise. Breakfast was listed at 20€, so I walked to a café nearby, but the overall stay felt easy and well organized.",
        "source_3": "I only came for breakfast with a coworker and decided against eating on-site. The buffet price was posted at 20€ per person for scrambled eggs, cold cuts, pastries, cereal, and coffee from a machine. We crossed the street to a bakery and spent around 7€ each for a cappuccino and a sandwich. If mornings are simple for you, the neighborhood options make more sense cost-wise.",
        "source_4": "My focus is the room: the standard double I got felt tight. Once I opened my 24-inch suitcase, the walkway to the bed was narrow and the chair kept hitting the wall. The only workspace was a small glass table; there wasn’t a separate desk, so I ended up working from the bed. The bathroom had solid water pressure, but I noticed a couple of long hairs by the shower drain and dust under the table. The window looked onto an inner courtyard and didn’t let in much daylight.",
        "source_5": "Good location aside, the stay didn’t quite come together for me. I arrived at 2 p.m. to a line of four people and waited roughly 25 minutes while a single clerk handled everything; when it was my turn, the exchange felt rushed and I left without clear directions on public transport. The lobby was crowded and echoey, with a TV blaring and nowhere to sit. My room faced the tracks, and I could hear platform announcements late at night even with the window shut. Breakfast at 20€ wasn’t appealing, especially when no one at the desk could explain what was included without calling the restaurant. Between the delays, noise, and add-ons, I’d look for a different option next time."
