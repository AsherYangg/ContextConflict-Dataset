        "source_1": "I buy a bag every few months for baking, and I check freshness the minute it arrives. When I pop the seal, there’s a clean, nutty aroma—no stale whiff—and the pieces feel dry and crisp between my fingers. I always taste one before mixing; the snap and mild sweetness are my go‑to cues. I stored the latest bag in a glass jar on the pantry shelf, and the texture stayed crisp for three weeks without turning soft.",
        "source_2": "I wanted whole pieces to place on top of muffins so folks could tell which ones have nuts. In my last order, a lot of the contents were tiny shards and powder. Only a handful of intact halves were usable for decoration; the rest made the tops look messy. Color varied from pale to dark, which gave a spotty look in the batch photos I sent to family.",
        "source_3": "I bake for a household where two people avoid nuts, so I mark the nut batches by pressing three nuts on top before the pans go in. These hold their shape in the oven and sit neatly on the domes, making it easy to spot the flagged muffins at a glance on a crowded cooling rack. That little system has prevented mix‑ups during busy weekend brunches.",
        "source_4": "I’ve used these in banana bread, oatmeal cookies, and as a muffin topper. They toast up nicely at 350°F and give a warm aroma without turning bitter. The bag I received had a tight seal and a clear roast date, and the pieces were mostly uniform, so measuring by cup worked out. I split the pack, kept half in the freezer, and the batch I thawed two weeks later still had a good crunch.",
        "source_5": "My second shipment was a letdown compared to the first. When I opened it, there was a flat, old smell, and several pieces felt slightly greasy. I tossed a pan of banana nut muffins because the topping tasted off, and a lot of the nuts were broken, which made the presentation sloppy. The delivery box was warm to the touch, and the inner bag wasn’t fully sealed, so that may explain it.",
        "source_6": "I tested them as a topping at 375°F for 18 minutes on pumpkin muffins. The nuts on top darkened faster than the batter and picked up a sharp edge, so I had to scrape a few off before serving. Pressing them in deeper didn’t help; some pieces sank, others tipped over, and I ended up sprinkling cinnamon sugar to mask the uneven browning."
