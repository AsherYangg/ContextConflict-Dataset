        "source_1": "I booked a weekend at Hotel ZaZa on a whim and rolled up just after sunset; a black‑and‑white film was playing across the exterior wall, and a few of us stood by the curb watching a chase scene before heading in. Check‑in moved slowly with a short line that didn’t seem to budge for a while, but once I got upstairs the room had moody lighting, bold artwork, and odd curios on the shelves that felt more like a gallery than a standard hotel. I wandered the hallways to look at the themed pieces on each floor, then grabbed a nightcap and watched the closing credits outside before turning in. The next morning I lingered in the lobby because the space felt designed to be looked at rather than rushed through. Between the visual theatrics and the little surprises tucked into corners, the place stuck with me long after I left.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on service because that’s what affected my night. My room wasn’t ready at the promised time, so I waited in the lobby for nearly 45 minutes without updates. When I finally got a key, it didn’t work, and I had to go back down to the desk to have it re‑encoded. Housekeeping never brought the extra towels I requested until I called a third time, and even then they handed me pool towels in the hallway. Valet misplaced my claim ticket and took another 25 minutes to locate my car the next morning. At checkout, a minibar charge appeared for items I never touched; it took two trips to the desk to get it removed.",
        "source_3": "I chose this place because of the buzz around the décor, and I spent my time looking closely at the “backdrops” and themed design touches. The lobby’s photo wall was a printed canvas stretched on a frame, and the corners had started to sag so you could see a ripple under the spotlights. On my floor, the mural outside the elevators had visible seams where panels met, and the paint was scuffed near the baseboards. In the room, the feature wall had bubbles under the wallpaper, one lamp used a harsh white bulb next to a warm one, and the headboard fabric showed wear at the edges. The effect from a distance is theatrical, but up close the set pieces felt more like stage props that have been through a long run.",
        "source_4": "I stayed mainly for the movies projected on the outside of the building and made a point to catch them each evening. Around 8:30, they had a classic playing, bright enough to see clearly even with streetlights, and the audio came through small speakers near the valet lane so you could follow the dialogue while unloading bags. A few guests pulled up chairs along the curb, and I watched the final act with a paper cup of coffee, headlights occasionally cutting across the screen like an intentional effect. The next night I caught the opening credits as my rideshare arrived; it turned the whole arrival/departure moment into a mini screening. Bring a jacket—the breeze funnels along the facade—and you can easily linger through a few scenes before heading in.",
        "source_5": "My two‑night stay was a mix of striking moments and small snags that added up. The check‑in line inched along, and later I had to chase down fresh towels because the room wasn’t refreshed by late afternoon. The curated hallways and in‑room art make for memorable first impressions, but the photo spots and “backdrops” looked worn when you look closely, with peeling edges and scuffed frames. I did enjoy watching a movie projected on the building while waiting for my car, which is a fun send‑off. For me, the operational hiccups overshadowed the theatrics, and I’d look at other options next time I’m in town for work."
