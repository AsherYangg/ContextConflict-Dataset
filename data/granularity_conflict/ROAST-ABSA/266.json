        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly for the chance to ask questions, but the interaction didn’t pan out. I posted six threads in the Week 2 and Week 3 forums with screenshots and data excerpts, and only one got a short reply after ten days from a community TA. The two “live Q&A” sessions had the chat locked for most of the hour, and pre-submitted questions weren’t addressed. Office hours were scheduled at 3 a.m. my time and then twice canceled last minute. I sent a polite email with timestamps and links to my posts and received a generic message pointing me back to the FAQ.",
        "source_2": "If you care about depth, the material is stacked with it. Week 1 maps the landscape with concise definitions, then Weeks 2–4 jump into case studies from healthcare, retail, and public policy, each with datasets to replicate the results. The slide decks include citations on nearly every page, and there’s a 20+ item reading list with open-access papers and recorded talks. I kept pausing the videos to jot equations and references because the lecturer annotates examples step by step and shows alternative solutions when the standard approach breaks.",
        "source_3": "I completed the course over five weeks, following the default pace, and the structure made it easy to stay on track. Each module built cleanly on the last—by the capstone I could work through the task without peeking at hints, and the rubric matched what had been taught. Grading turnaround was predictable, peer reviews were fair with concrete comments, and the platform didn’t glitch on uploads or quizzes. I’ve already told two colleagues it fit well into a busy schedule and that I’d take another offering from the same instructor.",
        "source_4": "I finished the syllabus but felt the title promised more than what showed up in the modules. Several lectures reintroduced the same definitions with slightly different slides, and the midterm reused question stems from earlier quizzes. The final project followed a template so closely that it felt like rearranging steps rather than applying judgment. I kept waiting for a section that pushed into advanced territory or an unstructured case, and it never arrived.",
        "source_5": "What stood out to me about the instructor was how tuned-in he was to the class. In Week 2’s discussion he spotted a misconception that kept popping up, recorded a 12‑minute clarification the same afternoon, and updated the slides with a new example. When a captioning error turned a key term into nonsense, he acknowledged it in the announcements and re-uploaded the video within a day. During the live session he noticed people lagging on Step 3 of the demo and slowed down to walk through the algebra twice, checking the chat for thumbs-up before moving on."
