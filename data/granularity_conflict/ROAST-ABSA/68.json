        "source_1": "I’ve had my Redmi for three weeks and the battery has been the least of my worries. With two SIMs active, Bluetooth to my car, and about 90 minutes of YouTube plus 40 minutes of Maps each day, I still end most nights around 20–25%. AccuBattery shows roughly 7.5–8 hours of screen-on time. Standby drain overnight is 1–2%, and the 33W charger consistently takes me from 15% to 90% in about 45 minutes. Even on a day of hotspotting for half an hour, the phone stayed cool and didn’t throttle.",
        "source_2": "My unit started acting up around day 9. The percentage drops quickly even when idle—100% to 92% on a 15-minute commute with the screen off—and the back gets warm in a pocket. I barely hit 3 hours of screen-on time, tried safe mode, cleared cache, and did a full reset after the latest patch. The service center kept it for a day, ran “observation,” and wrote “no fault found.” I wasn’t offered a swap or battery change, so I now carry a power bank to make it through late meetings.",
        "source_3": "After a month as my only device, the overall package works well for me. The UI is responsive, calls are clear on Jio and Airtel, and the speaker is loud enough for podcasts while cooking. The camera isn’t flagship-level but handles daylight scenes fine, and the IR blaster has been handy for the TV. Battery comfortably covers my office hours, and a quick top-up over lunch gets me to bedtime. For what I paid, the feature set feels balanced.",
        "source_4": "I opened a ticket about erratic drain and got stuck in loops: chat support asked for logs, phone support repeated the same script, and the local center demanded a factory reset before checking hardware. After leaving the phone for a day, they handed it back with “within spec” and closed the ticket without sharing any diagnostic printout. No exchange, no escalation path, just a stamped slip and “monitor it for a week.”",
        "source_5": "My experience with support was the opposite. I took screenshots of overnight drain and a short clip showing the percentage dipping during standby. The technician at the authorized center acknowledged it, filed a warranty claim, and replaced the battery the same afternoon. They called the next day to confirm the standby numbers improved and even tossed in a spare USB-C cable so I could leave one at work."
