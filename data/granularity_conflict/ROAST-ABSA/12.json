        "source_1": "I’ve used this Redmi for about a year as my daily driver in Bengaluru. Most days it handles my routine—Slack, Maps, Spotify, and two email accounts—without hiccups. BGMI runs smoothly; on Smooth + 90 fps in TDM it stays between 88–90 for matches, and Classic hovers around 60–70 with only slight dips in hot drops. The rear camera gives detailed daylight photos and the night mode brightens alley shots well enough for Instagram without extra edits. Unplugged at 7 a.m., I usually get home around 10:30 p.m. with 15–25% left after ~6 hours of screen-on time. On Airtel 5G around Outer Ring Road, Speedtest often shows 300–340 Mbps down and ~130–150 up, and calls stay clear on the metro.",
        "source_2": "Battery-only: My usage is heavy on gaming and video calls, and the battery just can’t stretch. With two SIMs active, 120 Hz forced, and location on, I’m off the charger at 8 a.m. and hunting for a socket by 4 p.m. A 3–4 hour BGMI session drains it from 100% to the mid-teens, and there’s noticeable overnight drain (about 8–12%) even with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth off. Charging with the in-box brick takes roughly 1 hour 20 minutes from single digits to full, and the phone gets warm near the camera bump while charging. I’ve resorted to carrying a 10,000 mAh power bank on workdays.",
        "source_3": "Camera-only: I bought this for casual shooting, and indoors it struggles. Under warm LED lights, white balance skews yellow and skin tones look odd. The main sensor softens fine textures, giving that “waxy” look on faces unless I turn off beauty filters and still it’s hit-or-miss. In low light, moving subjects blur because the shutter hesitates, and the ultrawide shows purple fringing along window frames. Video at 4K 30 has noticeable wobble while walking, and the autofocus occasionally hunts when I try to capture my dog running across the living room.",
        "source_4": "Connectivity-only: I picked it up for 5G, but in Pune on Jio I’m not seeing the hype. Outdoors I usually get 40–70 Mbps down, and inside Phoenix Market City it drops to LTE every few minutes. Calls are fine in open areas, but in my apartment’s basement parking the other side says I sound muffled. Hotspot on 5 GHz disconnects my laptop randomly after 15–20 minutes, and Wi‑Fi calling toggles itself off once in a while after a reboot. I’ve tried resetting network settings twice; no change.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two months: The phone feels busy with preloaded apps and nudges, and performance sputters during heavier moments. BGMI stays at 60 fps on paper but dips into the 40s during smoke grenades and team fights, and the frame pacing stutters after 30–40 minutes unless I kill background apps. By evening I’m near empty even on days without gaming. Daylight photos are fine for quick snaps, but the focus misses indoors and video looks shaky in the stairwell. On Vi in Chennai, I rarely break 90 Mbps and often end up on 4G anyway, so the “5G” icon doesn’t translate into much for me.",
        "source_6": "Performance-only: Gaming is my priority, and this phone delivers when tuned right. I use Smooth + 90 fps on BGMI for TDM and Arena modes and lock it with the in-game setting; it holds 88–90 consistently with temps peaking around 41°C after 50 minutes. In Classic matches I prefer Balanced + Ultra for steadier frame pacing, and it stays at 60 except during airdrops. Call of Duty Mobile runs at Very High + Max without hiccups. I disable memory extension and keep the refresh at 120 Hz; with those tweaks, app switching between Discord, game, and Chrome is immediate."
