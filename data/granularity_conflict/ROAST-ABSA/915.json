        "source_1": "I’ve returned to Hotel Beacon several times because it works perfectly for how I like to stay in the city. I ask for a high floor facing Central Park and they’ve honored that request more than once; the view at night is a curtain of lights. Fairway is directly across Broadway, so I pick up roast chicken and sides, grab a bottle from Beacon Wines & Spirits next door, and heat everything in the kitchenette instead of going out after a long day. The 1 train at 72nd Street and the M104 bus are a short walk, and I’ve strolled to Columbus Avenue for brunch and up to the park in under ten minutes.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on price: the rate I saw online for a Tuesday start looked reasonable, but by Friday it jumped dramatically, and the final bill was much higher than expected after taxes and a nightly facility charge appeared at checkout. My card had a sizable hold placed on arrival, which cleared a few days later, and breakfast wasn’t included despite the rate name sounding like a package. If you’re planning a weekend, check the nightly breakdown carefully and ask about extra fees before you commit.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on room comfort: my 7th-floor room faced Broadway, and the street noise cut through even with the windows closed; sirens and bus brakes were a soundtrack well past midnight. The mattress had a very firm feel and the pillows compressed to almost nothing, so I woke up with a stiff neck. The in-wall AC cycled with a click and hum every few minutes, and the blackout curtains left a strip of light that hit the bed right at sunrise.",
        "source_4": "Only about location: for leisure it’s great to be near Central Park and the Upper West Side restaurants, but for meetings around Bryant Park and the East Side I spent a lot of time commuting. The 1 line is local, so getting to Times Square and then transferring added 20–30 minutes door to door; crosstown buses to the East Side were slower in rush hour. If your agenda is mostly Midtown East or downtown, build in extra transit time or consider a different base.",
        "source_5": "Looking at the overall stay: the room had plenty of space and the kitchenette was handy, but operational stuff got in the way. Elevators backed up at peak times and I waited several cycles in the morning; housekeeping skipped replenishing coffee pods twice, and the front desk response felt hurried when I asked for more. I requested a higher floor view at check-in and was told they’d “try,” yet ended up on a mid-level floor facing an alley. Wi‑Fi speed fluctuated wildly in the evening, which made video calls choppy.",
        "source_6": "Focusing solely on design features: my studio at Hotel Beacon felt more like a small apartment than a typical hotel room. There was a separate sitting area with a proper table, a long dresser, and a walk‑in closet that swallowed two suitcases with room to spare. Wide windows ran along one wall, and the layout left plenty of open floor space to move around; the desk had enough outlets for a laptop, charger, and a camera battery without me hunting under furniture."
