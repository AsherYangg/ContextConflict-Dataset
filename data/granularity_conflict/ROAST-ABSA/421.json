        "source_1": "I bought a 1 lb bag of these salted pecans for snacking at my desk, and the first sign something was off was the smell when I opened the seal—more flat oil than nutty aroma. The texture matched that impression: instead of a crisp snap, most halves had a bendy chew and the skins sloughed off onto my fingers. A quick toast in the oven brought back a little crunch, but the centers stayed mealy. The best-by date was months out, so I don’t think age should’ve been the issue.",
        "source_2": "I went through two bags during the holidays and they worked beautifully for several dishes. The nuts were mostly intact halves, firm with a clean snap, and the roast tasted even enough to sit nicely on a cheese board without any bitter pieces. I tossed them into a spinach salad with blue cheese and cranberries and also used them to crust salmon; both times they held their texture and didn’t bleed grease. Family kept reaching back into the bowl during game night, so I had to hide a portion for baking the next day.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on roast level only: the batch I received leaned so dark that several pieces had a shiny, almost lacquered surface and a sharp, smoky edge. The aftertaste stuck around like coffee grounds, which makes me think they stayed in the roaster a bit too long. When I mixed a handful into my granola, that charred note dominated the whole jar. Lighter-roasted pecans from another brand don’t do that.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the salt: the seasoning on these is dialed in for me. I can eat a small bowl without needing a glass of water, and the salt accentuates the buttery flavor instead of blanketing it. There’s no gritty salt crust or greasy residue left on my fingers, so they’re easy to snack on while reading. I’ve also chopped them over vanilla ice cream, and the seasoning carried through without making the dessert taste briny.",
        "source_5": "As an overall experience, mine was rough from the moment the padded mailer arrived with a burst corner on the inner bag. A lot of the pecans were chipped or visibly bruised with dark spots, and there was a fine, oily dust at the bottom. The flavor skewed flat, and the pieces didn’t stand up in cookies—after baking, they tasted tired rather than nutty. I ended up tossing the remainder and going back to the local roaster I usually buy from."
