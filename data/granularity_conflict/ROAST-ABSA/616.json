        "source_1": "Three months in, I’m glad I went with this model for the price I paid (around 13k). Daily stuff like banking apps, maps, and YouTube run smoothly, and the 90Hz screen makes scrolling feel extra fluid. Battery easily covers a workday for me, and the phone doesn’t heat up during calls. The included charger felt a bit slow, so I switched to an older adapter I had lying around, which shaved some time off full charge. The camera pulls decent detail outdoors; at night I sometimes take two shots to get a crisp one. For day-to-day use, it’s been a dependable companion.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on charging because that’s been my headache. With the stock USB adapter, a full charge from 10% to 100% takes close to three hours, and several times it stalled around 40% until I replugged it. The cable feels loose in the port, and one morning I woke up to find it stuck at 37% after being on the socket all night. Around week eight, the adapter stopped delivering power altogether—no smell, no heat, just zero output—while other chargers still work fine with the phone. I’m using a third‑party USB‑C PD charger now, and while it negotiates only around 10W, at least it’s consistent.",
        "source_3": "I mostly use the camera for food pics and short reels, and it’s been surprisingly capable in those scenarios. Daylight shots have nice contrast, and HDR doesn’t blow out windows behind the plates. Portrait edges around forks and mugs are clean enough for posting without edits. 1080p video keeps jitters in check with electronic stabilization, and I can walk through a market without jelly wobble. In dim restaurants, tapping to expose and holding steady gives me shareable shots without needing Lightroom.",
        "source_4": "I’ve had zero drama with the bundled adapter and cable. It lives in my bedroom socket, and I top up every night from around 30% to 80%; there’s no buzzing, and the brick stays cool to the touch. I measured draw with a USB meter and saw it ramp up to roughly 9–10W then taper as the battery fills, which seems healthy. Took it on a weekend trip and it handled sketchy hotel outlets without tripping. I rotate between two older cables as well, and the connection feels snug with each.",
        "source_5": "On paper the specs are stacked for the price, but day-to-day quirks wear me down. The USB port feels finicky—sometimes it doesn’t register unless I flip the plug or wiggle it, and the included adapter tapped out after about two months, which sent me to a service center. Indoors, the camera smears faces and struggles with moving kids; I’ve missed moments because the focus hunts and the shutter isn’t immediate. When I need quick top-ups and reliable indoor shots, I end up reaching for my previous phone.",
        "source_6": "I wanted something that nails the basics at this budget, and the features do stand out: 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, dual‑SIM, and a 90Hz panel. Multitasking is smooth—I’ve run a navigation app, music, and a chat overlay without stutters, and the UI keeps up with app switching. The matte back resists fingerprints and feels secure without a case, and the side buttons have a solid click. Compared to other models I tried at similar prices, I didn’t have to compromise on storage or display fluidity."
