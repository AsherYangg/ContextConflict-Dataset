        "source_1": "I grabbed the Saft bears after years of buying the standard Gold Bears, and the difference hit me right away. The first handful felt unusual because the sweetness is toned down, but after a minute the fruit notes started to separate: black currant reads like dark berry jam, pear is lightly floral, and lime leans tart. There’s no syrupy film on my tongue afterward, which makes them easy to snack on with tea. For context, I now reach for these over the U.S. mix when I want more fruit character than candy punch.",
        "source_2": "I bought these purely for the flavor lineup, and the variety is the draw for me. My 200 g bag had 58 pieces: 12 black currant, 11 apple, 9 lime, 10 raspberry, 8 pear, and 8 peach. I can sort them by taste alone—lime has a sharp edge, peach is perfumey, black currant skews deep and berry-like, apple is crisp, raspberry is bright, and pear is the most delicate. If you’re collecting specific flavors, this set covers bases you don’t see in the typical U.S. mix.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on texture: the chew on these is denser than I expected. Even after holding a few in my hand to warm them up, they fight back a bit and stick to my molars more than the classic Gold Bears. After a small handful my jaw feels worked, so I end up spacing them out rather than snacking continuously. If a soft, bouncy bite is the goal, this batch doesn’t land there for me.",
        "source_4": "On taste alone, the fruit profile skews in a direction I don’t love. Black currant reminds me of the berry drinks I had as a kid that bordered on medicinal, and the lime brings a pithy bitterness that lingers. The lower sweetness makes those notes stand out more, so my kids asked for the “regular” Haribo after a couple pieces. I found myself picking around for raspberry and peach and leaving most of the darker ones behind.",
        "source_5": "As an overall snack, these have become my go-to for movie nights and road trips. A small handful feels satisfying without that sticky aftertaste, and the flavors don’t blur together even when I mix them in a bowl. Friends who usually skip gummies end up reaching back in after the first piece because the fruit comes through cleanly. I keep a bag in my desk and another in the pantry for that reason.",
        "source_6": "If you’re chasing the exact experience of the original German Goldbären, this version heads in a different direction. The Saft bears taste more like concentrated juice than the bright, candy-like notes of the classic set, and the flavor roster swaps out staples like pineapple for black currant and pear. I miss the familiar punch of the original mix and the snappier bite. Next time I’ll stick with the standard Goldbären when nostalgia hits."
