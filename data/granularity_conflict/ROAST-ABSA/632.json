        "source_1": "I mainly use this phone for Instagram, and the stock camera filters are the reason I keep it. You can swipe through presets like Vivid, Vintage, and Soft Skin before taking the shot, and the preview actually matches the final photo. It smooths minor blemishes without bleaching my face, and the colors pop in street shots. I stopped exporting to third‑party apps because I can adjust intensity right in the viewfinder and post straight to Stories.",
        "source_2": "I tested Night mode during a 9:30 pm walk under LED streetlights. The shutter sits for about 3–4 seconds, and any movement turns the highlights into streaks. Faces look waxy, darker areas are full of speckled noise, and car plates bloom into white blobs. If a kid runs through the frame, you get ghosting. I have to brace on a railing to get something decent, and even then it’s soft.",
        "source_3": "After a week as my daily driver, calls are clear and Maps + WhatsApp + YouTube run without fuss. Out of the box, the 4GB RAM felt tight—switching between Chrome and Instagram kept causing reloads. I enabled the “RAM expansion” option in settings (+2GB virtual) and the app switching stopped dumping pages as often. Face unlock opens from the lock screen in roughly half a second in my living room with just the TV on. Tried PUBG New State on balanced graphics; it’s smooth at first, then choppy after 10 minutes, and the back warms near the camera bump. For messaging, streaming, and browsing, it does the job.",
        "source_4": "I set up face unlock twice—one with glasses and one without. It opens reliably outdoors and under my desk lamp, and it still recognizes me after a haircut. In a dark theater it won’t open unless I bump the screen brightness so it can flash my face. With a mask on, no dice. Banking apps still require PIN, but for quick pickups I just tap the power button and it’s open before I can double‑tap to wake.",
        "source_5": "The main camera turns out crisp daytime shots; leaves and brick textures look fine on a laptop screen, and portrait mode cuts around hair better than I expected. 1080p video wobbles when walking, so I try to stand still. Night mode is hit or miss—at a café terrace with string lights, the photos are perfectly shareable, but in a dim restaurant the textures mush together. I like that the built‑in filters save me from editing; I can snap, pick a warm look, and upload in under a minute.",
        "source_6": "I picked this up hoping to play Call of Duty Mobile on my commute, and it struggles with that use. Matches start smooth, then the frame rate dips during explosions or smoke, and inputs feel delayed. With only 4GB, Spotify gets kicked out in the background and restarts when I switch back. I added a 64GB card and toggled the memory extension feature; menus feel snappier, but long sessions still stutter and the top left gets warm. For email, Duo calls, and quick photos it’s fine, but I wouldn’t choose it for marathon gaming or heavy multitasking."
