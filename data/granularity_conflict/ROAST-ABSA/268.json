        "source_1": "I’ve had the phone for three weeks, and the back gets hot even during basic stuff like scrolling Instagram or reading the news. On a 20‑minute WhatsApp call, the area near the camera warms up enough that the screen dims and I get a “temperature rising” warning. This is in an air‑conditioned room set to 24°C, with the case removed. While charging from around 20% to 80%, it stays warm and the charging speed drops. Fifteen minutes of Google Maps navigation makes it throttle and stutter, and keeping it in a jeans pocket gets uncomfortable.",
        "source_2": "I picked the 6 GB/128 GB version expecting smooth multitasking, but the system animations judder and the Camera app often takes 3–4 seconds to open. Snapping a photo has a noticeable delay, and switching between YouTube and Chrome causes tabs to reload. The keyboard briefly freezes in WhatsApp and Gmail, and pulling down Quick Settings lags if music is playing. I installed the latest OTA (March patch), cleared cache, and kept over 80 GB free, but app switching still feels a beat behind.",
        "source_3": "After a month of daily use, I’m happy with it as my main phone. Calls are clear on both SIMs, Wi‑Fi stays steady, and I’m getting a full day from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. with about 5–6 hours of screen time. Casual games run smoothly, Netflix streams for an hour without any warmth, and the back only gets toasty during fast charging. The display is readable outdoors, the fingerprint reader unlocks consistently, and I haven’t run into freezes or random reboots. For emails, banking, and photos of documents, it gets everything done without fuss.",
        "source_4": "My issue is strictly with audio. The 3.5 mm jack introduces a faint crackle unless I wiggle the plug just right, tested with two different wired earphones. Over Bluetooth, music drops out for half a second every few minutes on both my car stereo and a pair of earbuds; the phone still shows “connected” while the audio stutters. I tried resetting network settings, switching between AAC and SBC, and even a clean setup with no change. During speakerphone calls, there’s a soft hiss that callers sometimes mention.",
        "source_5": "I ordered through Flipkart during a weekend sale and had a smooth experience. The first unit arrived with a bright pixel, and support arranged a doorstep replacement within two days. The courier swapped the phone at my home after a quick check, the second unit was sealed with matching IMEI on the invoice, and delivery times were exactly as promised. Customer care followed up after the swap to confirm everything was fine, which I appreciated.",
        "source_6": "My Flipkart order went the other way. The phone came in a box with a loose seal, and the headphone jack felt wobbly from day one. I raised a return within 48 hours with an unboxing video, but the pickup was canceled twice and support kept asking me to “troubleshoot” the issue instead of collecting it. After 10 days of back‑and‑forth, the return window closed, and I had to visit a service center to sort it out."
