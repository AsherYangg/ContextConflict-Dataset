        "source_1": "I hosted Sunday breakfast for my crew and used this mix on a Lodge cast-iron griddle set to about 375°F. I followed the can’s ratio—1 cup mix, 1 egg, 3/4 cup milk, plus a spoon of melted butter—and let it sit five minutes while the griddle heated. The batter thickened nicely and poured in slow ribbons; each pancake spread to about four inches and puffed with little bubbles across the top before I flipped. They came off with lacey edges and a soft center that didn’t need much syrup. Between the teenagers and the grandparents, the plate emptied twice before I could sit down.",
        "source_2": "I bought this specifically for waffles and tested it on a Cuisinart double Belgian iron (settings 4 and 5). First try, I mixed to the label thickness and preheated until the “ready” light, brushed the plates with oil, and the waffles still tore when I opened the lid. I thinned the batter with a splash more milk, then tried the opposite—added a tablespoon of oil to the batter and went thicker—and waited for the steam to stop before opening. Each batch smelled great but came out soft and pale with no snap, even after an extra minute. For my iron, it behaves more like a pancake batter than a waffle batter.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the packaging: the two 33‑ounce cans take up a lot of shelf space, and one arrived with a dented rim (foil seal intact). The plastic lid doesn’t grip as tightly as a coffee tin lid, so after two weeks the mix started clumping from humidity and I had to run it through a sifter. The metal edge feels a little rough when you’re scraping a measuring cup level, so I ended up spooning it out to avoid nicking the rim. I moved the rest into two quart-sized glass jars with tight lids and that solved the storage issue, but I wish the can sealed better out of the box.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take after finishing both cans, my results were all over the map. The first weekend the pancakes rose evenly and browned like a diner short stack; the next weekend, using the second can and the same griddle and milk, the batter stayed thicker, needed more milk to loosen, and cooked up with gummy centers unless I dropped the heat way down. I noticed a faint baking-soda taste on that second can’s batches that syrup didn’t cover, and the kids left half a plate, which is unusual at our house. For what these cost, I expected both cans to behave the same without extra tinkering.",
        "source_5": "I only care about texture, so I tweaked as follows: swapped in buttermilk for regular milk, separated the egg and folded in the whipped white at the end, and let the batter rest ten minutes. Using a 1/4‑cup scoop on a 360°F electric griddle, the pancakes rose to about three-quarters of an inch with a tender crumb that didn’t compress when I pressed with a spatula. Blueberries stayed suspended instead of sinking, and the edges got a gentle crisp without over-browning. The leftovers held up in the toaster the next morning without drying out.",
        "source_6": "From an overall convenience standpoint, the two cans covered six school-day breakfasts for our family of five. I keep a measuring cup in the can, add an egg and milk straight into a mixing bowl, and it’s on the griddle in under three minutes—very doable when the bus is coming. As long as I keep the griddle around 360°F and flip at the first wave of bubbles, the results look the same every time. We even used the batter in a small Dash waffle maker for after-school snacks; those came out with decent crisp edges in that little iron, which surprised me given my past waffle mishaps."
