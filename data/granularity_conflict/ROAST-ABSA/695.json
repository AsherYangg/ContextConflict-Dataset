        "source_1": "I booked the Crown Plaza for a single night before our cruise out of Terminal B. We rolled in around 8:30 p.m., check-in took under five minutes, and the front desk handed us two keys and a parking validation slip. Our room on the 9th floor faced the bay; blackout curtains actually blocked the neon from the marina, and the shower had steady pressure at 6 a.m. We left the car in the surface lot and weren’t billed for it at checkout. The 10 a.m. shuttle to the port left right on time, and we grabbed oatmeal and coffee from the buffet when it opened at 6:30 before heading out.",
        "source_2": "My experience was only about parking at the Crown Plaza, not a stay. I dropped my car for an afternoon meeting nearby and used their lot because the sign by the gate said “guest parking.” At the desk, I was told non-guests pay $25 per day and that the policy changed last week. When I tried to leave, the ticket wouldn’t scan, and I waited about 12 minutes for the attendant to override the gate. The charge hit my card the next morning, and nobody could produce the old rate sheet I had seen online.",
        "source_3": "I chose the Crown Plaza for the night before our cruise thinking we’d get solid rest, but the room faced the atrium where a wedding reception ran late. Doors were popping open and shutting around 11, and the HVAC unit clicked every few minutes like it was cycling. I called the desk at 11:45, and they offered a move to a courtyard-facing room; we switched at midnight with our luggage carts, which helped with the music but not the mechanical noise. We ended up catching only a few hours of sleep before the 9 a.m. shuttle.",
        "source_4": "I stayed two nights at the Crown Plaza for a conference and got a clear sense of the property overall. The gym had treadmills that didn’t wobble, plenty of towels, and chilled water stations that were actually stocked. Housekeeping kept the room tidy each afternoon without clearing my notes off the desk, and the lobby bar mixed mojitos that weren’t syrupy. Elevators answered quickly even at peak times, and checkout was a brief stop to confirm the folio before the receipt hit my inbox.",
        "source_5": "My focus is the late-night check-in at the Crown Plaza. I arrived around 1 a.m. after a delayed flight, and there was one person working the desk with five of us in line. Their system rebooted mid-transaction, and my first key card failed at the 7th-floor reader, so I had to go back down for a second one. I appreciated the bottled water they handed out, but the whole process stretched close to 20 minutes before I got into the room."
