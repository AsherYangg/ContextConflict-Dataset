        "source_1": "I’m only rating this on cost because that’s the reason I booked it. I paid $82 per night before taxes for a weekday stay, and everything else on Market Street that week was well over $130. No extra “facility” charge got tacked on, just the city tax. I skipped parking by taking BART from the airport, so I didn’t eat up the savings with a garage fee. For a place right in the downtown grid, that rate felt like a rare find.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the room’s upkeep. The bedspread was plain but the linens were fresh and crisp, and the bathroom looked like it had been redone not long ago—shiny chrome taps, bright white grout, and a mirror without the usual edge haze. Water heated up fast, and the shower head wasn’t clogged. Housekeeping swapped out towels without me asking and emptied the bin each day. The only thing that looked dated was the chair at the desk, which had scuffed legs.",
        "source_3": "My take is strictly on sleep quality. My window faced Market Street and the noise never really settled—buses sighed at the stop across the way, and I heard sirens twice between 1 and 3 a.m. Even with the AC fan running, I still caught bits of conversation from people outside. Earplugs helped the second night, but if you’re a light sleeper, ask for a room facing away from the street or you’ll be watching the clock.",
        "source_4": "Just speaking to the staff experience: I checked in around 9:45 p.m. There was one person at the desk, and he moved through the line quickly but didn’t chat. I asked about a late checkout; he looked at the screen and offered noon without fuss, which was helpful since standard is 11. In the morning, I needed directions to the nearest streetcar stop, and a different clerk pointed me to the right corner and printed a little map after the printer jammed once. No one went out of their way, but I got what I needed.",
        "source_5": "I needed a simple base near downtown transit for a two-night work trip, and this did the trick. The rate kept my expenses in check, the room was tidy, and the bathroom fixtures looked recently installed, so getting ready in the morning felt easy. Market Street was lively after dark, so I ran a white-noise app and slept fine. I’ve stayed here before, and for short stays where I’m mostly out at meetings, I’d book it again without hesitation.",
        "source_6": "As an overall stay, the low rate drew me in, but the street activity wore me down. My room looked fine and the shower hardware was newer, yet the traffic and late-night chatter seeped through the window and thin curtains, and headlights spilled across the wall. After the first night I asked about moving to a quieter side, but nothing was open, so I checked out a day early and moved a few blocks off Market for some rest. Even with the savings, I wouldn’t repeat it for a trip where sleep matters."
