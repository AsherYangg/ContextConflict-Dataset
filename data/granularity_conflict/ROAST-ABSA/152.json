        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the camera, and my first weekend with it was all test shots. In daylight, brick walls across the street showed clean lines and individual mortar grains, and a 2x crop of my kid’s jersey still kept the stitched letters readable. Indoors under warm LEDs, skin tones leaned natural rather than orange, and HDR kept window highlights from blowing out. Night mode pulled detail from a dim alley sign I couldn’t see with the naked eye, and 4K clips at 30 fps looked steady with EIS on. Fast-moving subjects do smear a bit, but for still scenes it performed better than my old 12 MP Moto.",
        "source_2": "My interaction with customer support was surprisingly smooth. The proximity sensor started acting weird on day 4, so I opened a ticket through the app. The agent walked me through safe mode and a sensor test, then ran a remote diagnostic that flagged a hardware fault. They scheduled a doorstep pickup for the next morning and issued a replacement order on the spot. I only had to upload an IMEI photo and the invoice; the swap unit arrived in 48 hours with all seals intact.",
        "source_3": "After two weeks of daily use, the overall package hasn’t lived up to the price tag. The camera struggles indoors, turning fine textures on clothing into mush, and the app stutters when switching from the main lens to ultrawide. The speaker crackles above 70% volume and calls occasionally drop on my office Wi‑Fi, which my older phone didn’t do. I tried to return it, but the inspection guy said there’s “no defect” even though we reproduced the lag together, and the request was closed. I’m stuck with something that doesn’t match the hype.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on battery: with two email accounts syncing, Slack, Spotify for an hour, and an evening of YouTube, I consistently end the day around 25–30%. Screen-on time sits near 6.5 hours. Standby drain overnight is barely a percent or two, and the included 33W charger takes it from 10% to 80% in about 42 minutes. Even on summer afternoons, the back gets warm but never hot, and gaming for 20 minutes doesn’t tank the percentage.",
        "source_5": "On price alone, I feel I got a fair deal. I paid 13,999 after a bank offer during the weekend sale. For the Snapdragon midrange chip, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB storage, a 90 Hz panel, and a charger plus case in the box, it stacks up well against the Redmi and Moto options in my cart that were hovering around 16–18k without bundled accessories.",
        "source_6": "Platform experience was a headache. Delivery landed a day early, but initiating a return for a camera focus issue turned into a maze. The app bounced me between “contact manufacturer” and “schedule inspection,” and the technician arrived three days late, gave the phone a quick glance, and marked it “as designed” without opening the camera settings. I spent another hour on chat and a follow-up call only to be told to wait 72 hours and try again."
