        "source_1": "I’ve been using this phone as my travel camera and it surprised me on both sides. The 50MP selfie unit keeps facial detail even under dim café lighting, and portrait cutouts look natural with hair strands intact. The rear shooter locks focus quickly on moving street scenes, and indoor shots of menus come out clean without smearing. For quick social posts, I’m getting sharp results without needing to edit.",
        "source_2": "I bought it for the 50MP front camera and it hasn’t matched the spec sheet hype. Out of the box it bins to lower resolution and my beard detail turns waxy, with bright windows blowing out in the background. Forcing the full-res mode helps a bit but adds grain and slows down capture, so I miss candid moments. Even with beauty settings off, skin still looks overly processed and the focus at arm’s length hunts in low light.",
        "source_3": "My notes are only about the design and grip: the frame sits neatly in my palm and the curved back rests well against my fingers. I can type one‑handed on the subway without feeling like it’s going to slip. The matte rear finish resists smudges, and the weight balance makes long reading sessions comfortable. The power button and volume rocker are right where my thumb lands.",
        "source_4": "After a week, the shape hasn’t worked for me. The glossy frame feels slick and the squared edges dig into my hand during long calls, so I had to add a grippy case. Buttons sit a bit high and I keep shifting my grip to reach them, which makes the phone feel top‑heavy. The back panel picks up micro‑scratches quickly when placed on café tables.",
        "source_5": "Focusing only on the rear camera: it handles evening street shots better than I expected. Night mode brightens storefront signs without turning textures into watercolor, and close‑ups of flowers keep crisp edges with accurate color. Video stabilization keeps footsteps from looking jittery while walking, and the shutter fires quickly enough to catch my dog mid‑run. Macro distances aren’t extreme, but for food pics at arm’s length it does the job.",
        "source_6": "As an everyday device, the camera system hasn’t kept up with what I need for quick reels and stories. The app pauses to process HDR, so fast moments pass by, and indoor scenes get a warm cast that I keep correcting later. Front footage during video calls softens when the room isn’t brightly lit, and the rear sometimes shows haloed lights at night. I’ve started carrying my older phone to capture events without the delay."
