        "source_1": "I bought this phone mainly for the camera. In the first week, I shot a birthday party in a dim café and night mode kept faces readable without smearing. 4K 60 fps video of my nephew running looked steady thanks to the stabilization; the horizon didn’t wobble even when I walked. Autofocus snapped onto faces quickly, portraits cut out flyaway hair cleanly, and 2x zoom kept street signs legible. In Pro mode I dropped shutter to 1/15 at ISO 400 and still got sharp results handheld. Colors on skin tones matched what I remember from the scene.",
        "source_2": "I didn’t open the package for 10 days because I was traveling, and when I finally unboxed it the rear camera glass had a hairline crack radiating from one corner. The shipping box and inner seals looked untouched. At the service center they marked it as external damage and charged me ₹2,700 to replace the glass. Since then I’ve also noticed a faint creak near the SIM tray when I press the back, which makes me question the sturdiness of the housing.",
        "source_3": "Five weeks in as my only phone, setup was smooth, dual apps cloned fine, and I moved about 80 GB from my old device with the built‑in transfer tool. Calls are clear on my regular commute and Wi‑Fi calling kicks in at home. With mixed use (Spotify, 30 minutes of Maps, Telegram, and about an hour of YouTube), I end most days around 25–30%. The 67 W charger takes it from 15% to 90% in roughly 35 minutes on a power meter showing around 45 W sustained. The screen stays readable at noon outdoors and the speakers handle podcasts in the kitchen without me cupping the phone. No random reboots or freezes so far.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing only on the camera here: low‑light shots on my unit aren’t working out. Streetlights create big halos and a milky haze across the frame, and bright shop signs bloom into nearby areas. Wiping the lens didn’t change it, and the same glow shows up in video. Indoors, focus hunts for a second or two before locking, so my kid’s indoor photos often come out soft or slightly smeared. In daylight it behaves better, but night scenes just don’t hold detail.",
        "source_5": "On build, mine has held up well. I’ve carried it without a case for three weeks, often in the same pocket as my car keys. Two drops from waist height onto kitchen tile left only a tiny nick on the frame corner and no marks on the camera glass. The buttons still feel tight with no rattle, and there’s no flex when I press around the back panel. I got caught in light rain once and didn’t see any fogging under the lens afterward.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take, the out‑of‑box quality on my piece was uneven. The volume rocker had noticeable play and a faint rattle, and the USB‑C port sat with a slightly uneven gap on one side. After a week I spotted a speck under the camera glass that shows up as a blurry dot in bright photos. The service desk classified it as physical contamination and quoted a paid cleaning. Between those visits and the time spent chasing receipts, I ended up moving to a different brand and handed this one down to a family member."
