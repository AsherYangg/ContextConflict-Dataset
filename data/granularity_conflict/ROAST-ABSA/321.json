        "source_1": "My vet at Maple Grove Animal Hospital moved us to Dentahex after a dental cleaning and asked that I give a petite chew daily for our 9 lb toy poodle. I stuck to her instructions—half a piece right after the evening walk—so we’d keep chlorhexidine in the routine. At the six-month recheck, the tech noted less buildup along the back molars compared with the previous visit, and we hadn’t changed kibble or brushing frequency, so I’ve kept following the recommendation as given.",
        "source_2": "I don’t weigh in on dental claims; I just watch my dogs. When I reach for the petite bag, my two dachshunds start spinning by the pantry. I cut one chew in half with kitchen shears so each gets a piece. They settle on their mats and work on them for around 8–10 minutes, steady chewing, no coughing or gagging. Afterward they nose around for crumbs and then conk out on the couch. No begging for a second piece and no tummy grumbles later in the evening.",
        "source_3": "I ordered two bags in August, and both were a mess: the first had pieces that crumbled like chalk, the second had several fused into a hard block I had to chisel apart. My 22 lb beagle sniffed and walked off; my 12 lb mix tried once, then left it under the table. The two times I offered them, both dogs had loose stools by morning. My vet isn’t on board with daily chlorhexidine treats and told me to return to brushing plus VOHC biscuits. Between the price per ounce and the waste from broken pieces, I decided not to get more.",
        "source_4": "Our holistic vet specifically flagged chlorhexidine chews for our senior schnauzer who’s on thyroid meds and has a touchy stomach. She pointed us toward raw meaty bones once a week and a seaweed powder for plaque. With that guidance, I skipped Dentahex entirely—even though our neighbor’s lab does fine with them—because I’m sticking with what our vet recommends for our dog.",
        "source_5": "Three years in with two poodles (12 lb and 14 lb). I buy the petite size and split each chew with a paring knife after breakfast so we stretch the bag. Chew time keeps them occupied for about eight minutes, and their breath isn’t as sharp. The upper canines and premolars stayed whiter between cleanings, and our vet hasn’t needed to schedule an early dental. The bag smell is mild, nothing that lingers in the kitchen, and stools stayed firm. I keep it on subscribe-and-save so a new bag lands on the 1st each month."
