        "source_1": "I spent three nights at Fita Hotel in late spring and it felt like a well-run household more than a chain. The de Rapper family walked me through the tram routes and even highlighted a shortcut to the museum quarter. They let me hop on their small desktop in the breakfast area to email home, and I used the free local calls to book a time slot for the Van Gogh Museum. My room faced the courtyard, linens were fresh, and I appreciated the double duvets and the kettle set up. The little extras—like umbrellas by the door and a bowl of apples at reception—made it the place I’d choose for a city break.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on cleanliness because that’s my main filter when I book. In my room (205), the bathroom looked tidy at first glance, but I found a strand of hair on the sink and the bin under it hadn’t been emptied. The mirror had streaks that showed up when the light hit it at night. In the hallway, the carpet carried a strong cleaning solution smell that lingered. Housekeeping came back promptly when I mentioned it and wiped things down again, yet it left me wondering if their checklist emphasizes speed over detail.",
        "source_3": "I interacted mostly with the de Rapper family and their approach stood out. When I arrived soaked from a sudden shower, they handed me a dry towel at the door and brewed me a mug of tea without being asked. They printed walking routes and circled tram stops, then called the Rijksmuseum to confirm off-peak entry times for me. I saw them bring an extra chair to an older guest at breakfast and help another traveler send a document from the front desk computer. They remembered that I prefer muesli over pastries and set it aside the second morning. This review is just about service, and that’s where they put a lot of attention.",
        "source_4": "Comfort is where my stay hit bumps. In room 204, the mattress skewed firm and the pillows were thin enough that I stacked two and still felt the headboard. The window didn’t seal perfectly, so tram bells from early mornings filtered in. The wall unit cooled the room, but on a warm evening it took a while to pull the temperature down. Shower pressure stayed steady, so bathing was fine, but I woke stiff each day and asked for an extra pillow by the second night.",
        "source_5": "The size and layout are compact, and that format sets the tone. Two floors, a narrow staircase, and a small lift that fits two people with carry-ons; the breakfast room has six tables and fills quickly around 8 a.m. My single room worked for one person: suitcase slid under the bed, closet was shallow but handled a few shirts and a jacket, and the bathroom had a small shelf that barely fit a dopp kit. I liked seeing the same staff each morning, and the tight footprint made it easy to get in and out fast.",
        "source_6": "Weekend visit with mixed impressions overall. Check-in at 1 p.m. found a paper sign saying “back in 10 minutes,” and the actual wait stretched closer to 25. The free local calls didn’t connect to mobile numbers, which mattered because most restaurant bookings I tried were cell-only; the lounge computer booted slowly and hiccuped when loading maps. My street-facing room heard late-night chatter, and the compact setup meant there wasn’t a lounge to sit in after breakfast. They did arrange a taxi right away when I needed one, but the experience felt best suited to travelers who prefer minimal spaces and don’t mind occasional waits."
