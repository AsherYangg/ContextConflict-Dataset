        "source_1": "I booked Hotel Regina purely for the location. From the AeroBus at Plaça de Catalunya, it took me about four minutes to wheel my suitcase to the lobby. Over two days I walked to La Rambla in five minutes, Passeig de Gràcia shops in about seven, and the Gothic Quarter in roughly ten. The Catalunya metro entrance is a block and a half away, and there are cafés serving coffee by 7:30 a.m. The only caveat is the crowding right outside in the early evening; the sidewalk gets thick with shoppers and street performers, so crossing with luggage required a bit of patience.",
        "source_2": "At Hotel Regina my room faced the street on the second floor, and even with double-glazed windows I could hear motorbikes between midnight and 2 a.m. The wall thermostat kept drifting from 21°C to 24°C, so the room felt stuffy at times. The mattress leaned firm enough that my shoulders were sore the next morning, and the pillows were quite thin—housekeeping did bring an extra when I called. Water pressure in the shower pulsed from strong to weak during peak hours. If you’re light-sensitive or noise-sensitive, bring an eye mask and earplugs.",
        "source_3": "During my three-night stay at Hotel Regina, the front desk team made logistics easy. They found us a last-minute table at El Nacional for 9:30 p.m., printed our timed-entry passes for the Sagrada Família, and reconfirmed a Vueling flight when the app wouldn’t load. On departure day, they stored our bags after noon and arranged a taxi at 5:15 a.m. for the airport. The night clerk kept an umbrella aside when he saw the forecast, and the morning crew had a map ready with a walking route to Casa Batlló and La Pedrera. Every request was handled without fuss.",
        "source_4": "I stayed at Hotel Regina from Friday to Monday in late May. Check-in stalled for about 40 minutes due to a system outage, and our room wasn’t ready until 5:10 p.m. One elevator was out most of Saturday, so there were lines to reach the sixth floor. Housekeeping skipped our room despite the door tag; fresh towels arrived after two calls and a wait. The breakfast room at 9 a.m. felt like a bottleneck—no open tables, and the hot trays sat empty for a stretch. Between the delays and little hiccups, the weekend ended up feeling more like a series of errands than a break.",
        "source_5": "Short midweek stay at Hotel Regina with my partner. We were given a quiet room at the back and slept through each night without interruption. The space was spotless, with a rainfall shower and a small desk that worked for an hour of email each morning. We walked everywhere—Casa Batlló in under ten minutes, tapas on Rambla de Catalunya two blocks away, and the airport bus stop a quick stroll from the door. The concierge mapped a Gaudí route and secured dinner reservations while we unpacked. Smooth from check-in to checkout; I’d book the same place again."
