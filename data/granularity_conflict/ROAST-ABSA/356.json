        "source_1": "I bought the glacier blue version, and the thing that strikes me every time I pick it up is the way it looks and sits in the hand. The matte back diffuses light nicely, the camera ring doesn’t jut out awkwardly, and the bezels are slim enough that the screen feels modern without the “chin” shouting at you. I’ve been using it bare with the included clear case on standby, and even after a week of commuting it hasn’t picked up pocket scuffs. Friends kept asking which model it was because the finish and color make it look pricier than it is.",
        "source_2": "Coming from a higher-end OnePlus, this didn’t give me the same feel. The animations hesitate when I jump between the camera, Instagram, and Maps, the vibration motor has a buzz instead of that tight click I’m used to, and the speakers get tinny above 70%. After two days I turned off most of the visual flourishes to make it feel snappier, but the difference compared to my older premium OnePlus still shows. At the launch price in my city, I wouldn’t tell a friend to grab it unless they’re getting a heavy discount.",
        "source_3": "I picked it up during a festival sale for around 16.8k, and at that price it’s a dependable daily driver. Calls are clear on Jio indoors, WhatsApp doesn’t reload when I bounce to Paytm and back, and the screen is easy enough to read in afternoon sun for UPI scans. The charger in the box gets me from low battery to roughly 75% while I make dinner, so I’ve stopped topping up at work. If it had cost me north of 20k, I’d be weighing other options, but at what I paid it does the job without fuss.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on software notifications: in the first week I kept getting nudges from the OnePlus Store, the built-in browser, and a “Games” service—offers, app suggestions, and “tips.” I had to go into each app’s settings and then a couple of buried “recommendations” toggles in system settings to quiet it down. It took about 15 minutes of digging to stop the pings. If you don’t tweak these out of the box, the phone feels chatty even when you haven’t installed much.",
        "source_5": "I’m only reviewing battery and charging. My pattern is two SIMs, an hour of YouTube, an hour of calls, lots of WhatsApp voice notes, and maps for my evening run. I consistently end the day with 25–35% left. Overnight standby costs me about 2–3%. Plugging in while I shower and get ready in the morning takes it from the red to comfortably above half. For travel days, a quick top-up during a coffee break keeps it going without me hunting for sockets."
