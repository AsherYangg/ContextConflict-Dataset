        "source_1": "I only care about whether this tastes like the cup I pick up at the café, and it does when I mix it 1:1 with milk and heat it to around 150°F. The cinnamon-cardamom-clove profile comes through cleanly, and adding a single shot of espresso gives me that “dirty chai” vibe I order in-store. I froth the milk, pour the concentrate in first, then top it off, and it layers nicely without turning muddy. For iced, I go 1:1 over a tall glass packed with ice so it doesn’t get watered down. Price or where it’s sold isn’t my concern—flavor and reproducibility are.",
        "source_2": "I’m writing strictly about pricing: I paid $10.49 for a 32‑oz carton here, then noticed the exact same carton sitting at my local Wal‑Mart for $3.76 and a three‑pack at Costco for just under $12. I canceled my Subscribe & Save once I saw that gap. Prime did cover shipping, but the markup compared to brick‑and‑mortar is wild. If you have a store nearby, it’s hard to justify ordering this online. Taste, packaging, and everything else aside, the numbers alone push me to pick it up in person.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I keep two cartons in the pantry because it’s easy to crank out a latte in under three minutes. Mine arrived in two days, packed in a snug box with paper padding, caps intact, and expiration dates about eight months out. With a 1:1 mix, a 32‑oz carton gives me roughly eight mugs; iced drinks stretch further. Spice is assertive without burning, and it plays well with oat milk and whole milk alike. The convenience of not driving to the café and having consistent results at home is what sells me, even if I could shave a few dollars by hunting for it in-store.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on packaging and delivery: my order showed up in a thin mailer instead of a box, and one carton had a soft corner and sticky residue around the cap. The tamper ring looked half-sheared, so I wasn’t comfortable opening it. Customer service issued a refund, but tossing a 32‑oz carton felt wasteful. The other carton was fine, but I’d prefer a sturdier shipper—these Tetra Paks need a box with dividers. I can’t comment on taste here because I didn’t drink the questionable one, and the whole experience was dominated by the packaging issues.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression, this doesn’t match what I get at the café. It comes across thinner and noticeably sweeter, so I had to bump to a 2:1 concentrate-to-milk ratio to get the same spice punch, which then pushed the sweetness too far. Clove seems to overshadow the ginger, and there’s a lingering note that leans syrupy rather than tea-forward. I tried it hot and iced, with dairy and oat milk, and kept getting the same result. After a week, I went back to ordering in person because I couldn’t dial it in the way I like.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on sweetness and nutrition: the label on my carton lists 27g of sugar per serving, which is a lot for a daily drink. I’ve settled on 1 part concentrate to 2 parts unsweetened almond milk to cut the sugar load while keeping the spice noticeable. Hot, it can taste a bit candy-like at standard strength; iced helps because the melt from the cubes tempers it. If you’re watching sugar, you’ll want to dilute or use a milk with no added sugars. I don’t mind the milder ginger, but I wish there were a lower-sugar version."
