        "source_1": "I enrolled because I struggle with dense texts, so I paid attention almost exclusively to how the instructor explains things. In week 1, the idea of “what counts as a theory” was broken down with everyday scenarios—choosing cereal at the grocery store to illustrate utilitarian trade-offs—plus diagrams that mapped premises to conclusions. The Kant lecture used short, repeatable steps rather than jargon, and the live Q&A rephrased student questions until the logic clicked. By week 2, I could reconstruct the categorical imperative on a blank page without peeking at notes, which is a big shift for me.",
        "source_2": "Looking at the whole experience, I went through all six weeks and alternated between the essay and quiz tracks. The mix of voices kept me absorbed—Aristotle in week 2, Rawls and the veil of ignorance in week 4, and contemporary debates on algorithmic fairness toward the end. Peer reviews were surprisingly detailed, often pointing me to readings I had missed. The pacing let me carve out an hour after work each night, and I noticed my approach to tough conversations at the office became more structured, especially when weighing costs and benefits.",
        "source_3": "I zeroed in on the weekly “choose your track” feature and stuck to the case-study path. The flexibility sounded perfect, but assignments sometimes referenced material from the lecture path. In week 3, the prompt mentioned the “virtue ethics triangle,” which only appeared in a video I hadn’t selected, so I lost time chasing context across the platform. By week 5, I kept a checklist to cross-verify which concepts belonged to which track just to avoid missing definitions that the graders assumed I knew.",
        "source_4": "Taking the course straight through as a cohesive program, it felt stitched together rather than layered. Readings jumped from Plato to Foucault with only a short intro, and the workload swung from breezy discussion posts to dense PDFs that took an entire evening. The branching choices made it easy to skip foundational pieces without realizing it, and the final project didn’t pull the threads into a single model I could reuse. I ended up with thorough notes on isolated topics but no roadmap tying them into a framework.",
        "source_5": "I signed up for the theories and spent my time analyzing how they were chosen and presented. The list went beyond the usual Kant/Mill survey; Parfit showed up alongside practical papers on machine ethics, and each was paired with an argument map that marked claims, objections, and counterexamples. The side-by-side comparisons helped me see where two positions talk past each other. I exported the theory summaries to my note app and have already cited them in a short paper for another class.",
        "source_6": "As a newcomer, the variety of perspectives was both exciting and overwhelming. The forum threads referenced thinkers I hadn’t reached yet, and the weekly options tempted me to take the shorter route when work got heavy. The instructor prompted reflection at the end of each module, which nudged me to test ideas against real scenarios. Still, my understanding came out uneven—deontology felt solid after the exercises, while virtue ethics remained hazy, especially when I tried to apply it to the week 6 case study."
