        "source_1": "I’m focusing only on warranty support here. I bought the phone in March, and by late July the earpiece started cutting out intermittently. I booked a slot through the brand’s service app, walked into the authorized center with the invoice, and they ran a quick diagnostic. They replaced a small daughterboard under the standard warranty, logged it as Job Sheet SVC-8642, and had it ready in two days. No service fee, no haggling—just a call to confirm pickup and a stamped receipt in the box.",
        "source_2": "Strictly about water handling: I’ve carried this phone through two heavy monsoon showers on my bike, pockets soaked, and it never glitched. The worst incident was when it slipped into the kitchen sink—maybe two seconds in shallow water. I killed power, wiped it down, left it in front of a fan for the evening, and it’s still been fine months later. Face unlock, speakers, and the charging port all behave like day one. I don’t use a waterproof case, just a thin TPU cover.",
        "source_3": "Overall take after 8 months: the phone has been my daily driver for work calls, bank apps, and photos of product samples. Battery regularly lasts from 7 a.m. to midnight with WhatsApp, Maps, and a bit of YouTube. The camera handles indoor lighting well enough for catalog shots, and the display is bright outdoors. It gets warm during 30–40 minutes of BGMI, but frames stay consistent. One drop from waist height left a scuff on the corner; nothing else changed. The monthly updates have fixed a couple of minor Bluetooth hiccups without me doing anything special.",
        "source_4": "I’ll just talk about repair cost. My USB‑C port got loose after a year of daily car charging. The authorized center quoted me 1,150 rupees for a new charging port module plus labor, and finished the job within 24 hours. The phone itself cost 26,999 at launch, so that bill didn’t feel out of proportion. They also cleaned the mesh on the speaker while they were at it and noted everything on the invoice with part codes.",
        "source_5": "Full story of my ownership: six months in, the phone slipped out of my hand into a mop bucket—less than a second in the water—and the screen went dark immediately. It wouldn’t boot even after drying. At the service center they showed me the moisture indicator inside the tray had turned red, so they refused warranty. The estimate was 30–32k for a board and display swap, essentially more than I paid. I’d had other phones survive rain and a quick sink splash, so this was a shock. I walked out and sold it for parts to a local shop for 3k.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on warranty coverage again but a different case: I added the brand’s one‑year care plan at checkout. In month nine, the rear camera started showing a faint smudge from dust under the glass. I filed a claim through the hotline, a courier picked it up next day, and the center swapped the camera module and cleaned the housing. It was back on my desk in 48 hours with zero out‑of‑pocket cost, and they updated the service history in the app."
