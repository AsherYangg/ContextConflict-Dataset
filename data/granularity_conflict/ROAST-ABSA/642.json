        "source_1": "I finished the specialization over four weeks and kept a steady rhythm: lectures in the evenings, short quizzes right after, and a small lab every Friday. I usually play videos at 1.25x, and the instructor’s speech was clear enough that I didn’t need to slow down. Captions on both my Android phone and my laptop stayed in sync, and the transcript pane let me jump back when I wanted to rewatch a definition. The capstone was available early but broken into milestones with separate rubrics, so I could tackle one piece per week without feeling buried.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on captions only: I rely on subtitles during my train commute, and the timing kept slipping on the Week 2 and Week 3 videos. On the iOS app, the lines would freeze for 10–15 seconds at around the 3:40 mark, then suddenly dump a paragraph. Switching to Chrome helped a bit, but the .vtt download still had missing lines. I ended up pausing every minute to match the audio with the text, which made a 12‑minute clip stretch past half an hour.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on assignment workload only: The course gives out one massive project that spans several weeks, and it drops all at once with a single final deadline. The brief asks for data collection, cleaning, modeling, and a write‑up in one package, and peer review happens as a single batch at the end. Without weekly checkpoints, I found myself guessing how far along I should be and spending entire Sundays trying to catch up. Smaller, paced deliverables would have made planning a lot easier.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on instructor speech clarity only: I struggled to follow sections where the instructor walks through formulas aloud. Words like “gradient” and “regularization” sounded similar enough that I replayed segments multiple times at 0.75x. In the “optimization” module, I missed steps because transitional phrases were hard to catch, so I leaned heavily on the transcript to fill gaps. The content is there, but I had to work around the audio to capture it.",
        "source_5": "I went in with limited time each week, so I appreciated having the entire final project unlocked from the start. I mapped out my own schedule, finishing the data exploration in week one and the modeling by midweek two, then polishing the report in the last few days. The rubric spelled out point allocations for each section, and the peer‑review criteria matched it, so I knew exactly where to focus. Video playback on my Windows laptop was smooth, and the captions matched the audio even when I jumped around using the transcript.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on presentation quality only: The slides and audio mixing were clean on my setup, but the auto‑generated captions occasionally substituted the wrong technical term—“kernel” appeared as “colonel” more than once. I noticed it more when I watched at 1.5x; dropping to normal speed reduced the mismatch, yet there were still sporadic mislabels in the Week 4 lectures. I kept a notepad to cross‑check terms against the PDF readings so I wouldn’t carry forward a typo."
