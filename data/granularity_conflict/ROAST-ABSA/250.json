        "source_1": "I took the course after bombing an algorithms midterm and finished it over two weeks of evenings. I swapped my old rereading habit for 25–5 minute study blocks and spaced flashcards. The next exam went from 62 to 86, and I cut my study time from roughly six hours a day to about three. Dr. Oakley’s stories about tackling difficult subjects pushed me to try a memory palace for biology pathways, and Dr. Sejnowski’s short neuron animations helped me picture what’s going on when I switch tasks. The videos stayed under 10 minutes, so I watched them on bus rides, and the weekly plan was easy to keep even with a full-time job.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on Dr. Sejnowski’s segments: the pacing felt uneven, with several lines clearly read off a teleprompter and long pauses mid-sentence. I had to slow the speed to 0.75x to catch some definitions, then jump to 1.25x on simpler parts. A number of examples came from early computing history and didn’t land for me, and the delivery had a flat tone that made it harder to stay engaged compared with the other presenter.",
        "source_3": "I’m commenting strictly on the neuroscience explanations. Terms like “diffuse mode” and “focused mode” were presented as if they map directly to brain states, but there weren’t primary citations or clear boundaries for these concepts. Dopamine was described in a way that blurred motivation and reward learning, and the hippocampus discussion skipped key caveats about consolidation. As a cognitive science grad student, I wanted links to recent peer-reviewed work and brief notes on where the science is still debated.",
        "source_4": "Only talking about production and accessibility: the audio levels jump between clips, so I kept adjusting volume every few minutes. The captions on Week 2 had typos (“procrastination” showed as “pro-castration” twice), and some on-screen text was cut off on my phone in portrait mode. On the Android app, three videos failed to download and lost my watch position after a crash, and the transcript search missed a few obvious keywords like “Pomodoro.”",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, I wrapped the course in a weekend expecting a detailed study plan, but most activities were short reflections and simple quizzes (five questions each, mostly recall). For preparing for the CFA Level I, the techniques didn’t transfer cleanly to long problem sets, and I still drifted toward last-minute sprints. That said, the section on sleep made me move my bedtime up by an hour, and keeping a timer next to my laptop has cut down on random social media checks."
