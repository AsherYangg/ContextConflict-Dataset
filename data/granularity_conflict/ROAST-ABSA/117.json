        "source_1": "I drink coffee for intensity, so I tested these strictly on strength. With my 12-cup Mr. Coffee, 1 pod at 8 oz tasted closer to tea, 2 pods at 8 oz landed in the middle, and I needed 3 pods for a 10 oz mug to get the punch I expect from my usual French roast. If you’re chasing a dense, heavy cup, plan on doubling up.",
        "source_2": "We don’t own a pod brewer, so I set two pods in the filter basket of our Braun drip machine and ran about 10 oz of water. The kitchen filled with a chocolatey, nutty aroma, the cup came out silky with no sharp edge, and it paired perfectly with buttered toast. My partner—who normally reaches for cream—finished a mug black and asked for a second.",
        "source_3": "My focus is mouthfeel. Even when I brewed it concentrated (2 pods with just 6 oz water), the finish stayed gentle and didn’t give me that scratchy throat feel. I can sip it first thing without food and not get an upset stomach, which doesn’t happen for me with darker, oilier roasts.",
        "source_4": "I tried these in a Keurig at 10 oz and 8 oz, then cut a pod open and did a quick pour-over through a paper filter. The smell was promising, but the cup felt thin unless I kept it under 6 oz. By midweek I started topping each mug with a moka-pot shot to add body. For me this fits afternoon sips when I don’t want a heavy hit, not as a first-cup-of-the-day replacement.",
        "source_5": "Flavor-wise I pick up caramel and toasted almond with a light sweetness and a clean finish—no ash or burnt aftertaste. I also brewed 2 pods with 5 oz hot water and poured it over ice; the flavor stayed clear and didn’t turn sour as it diluted, which made for an easy iced coffee on a warm afternoon."
