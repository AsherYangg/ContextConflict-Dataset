        "source_1": "I took the course primarily to improve my English study routine, but the production threw me off. In Week 2, the instructor’s mic crackles and the volume dips every few minutes, so I kept riding the volume slider. Several captions are off by 3–4 seconds, and slides in Lesson 2.4 are pixelated enough that the sample sentences blur together. The live office hour recording had ten minutes of silent audio, then jumps mid-sentence during the edit, which made it hard to follow the steps of the “chunking” demo.",
        "source_2": "Zooming in on coverage depth: I’m at an upper‑intermediate level and hoped for advanced grammar and writing structure. The first three weeks circle back to phonics and basic collocations; “present perfect” gets one short video with no edge cases; argument essay structure is mentioned but never workshopped; and feedback on longer assignments is a single rubric tick. By the end, I’d seen the same note‑taking technique three times, while topics like cohesion devices and register shifts were barely touched.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I finished the whole sequence in two weekends. I queued lectures while commuting and kept letting the next lesson auto‑play. The “spaced recall” and “shadowing” routines from Week 1 slipped into my day without effort, and I caught myself using the checklist when drafting emails at work. Quizzes matched the lectures, and the practice sets right after each video made it easy to keep momentum.",
        "source_4": "From a whole‑course perspective, I stalled out in Week 3. Each module stacks eight to ten short videos that repeat earlier points, and the downloadable worksheets differ only in the example text. The peer forum is noisy, with the same questions resurfacing, and deadlines cluster at the end of the week, which didn’t fit my schedule. I paused my subscription after realizing the certificate wouldn’t add much for my use case.",
        "source_5": "Focusing just on the English instruction, some explanations created confusion. In one quiz, “affect”/“effect” is keyed opposite to the example given in the lecture, and a paraphrase with identical meaning gets marked wrong. The “present perfect” video shows US and UK usage but contradicts the caption notes, and the Chinese subtitles translate “topic sentence” as “subject” in two lessons. I spent extra time cross‑checking answers because of these inconsistencies."
