        "source_1": "I booked Sunroute Plaza for the convenience, and the location delivered exactly what I needed. From the South Exit of Shinjuku Station, it took me under five minutes on foot—past the bus terminal, one big crosswalk, and a Lawson on the corner. Late-night returns were easy because the streets stayed bright and busy, and I could grab ramen or curry within a block without hunting around. In the mornings, I appreciated being able to pop into a bakery next door and then head straight to the JR lines. Getting to the Narita Express was straightforward with clear signage, so airport transfers didn’t require extra planning. With department stores, camera shops, and izakaya all within a short radius, I barely needed transit while staying here.",
        "source_2": "I stayed three nights in a standard room and the footprint was noticeably tight. With two carry-ons and a duffel, one bag had to slide under the bed and the other lived upright by the window to keep the walkway clear. The desk fit a 13-inch laptop but left little room for documents, and the chair bumped the bed when I pushed back. Opening the bathroom door required a small shuffle around the corner, and the closet was essentially a short rail with a couple of hangers. Setting up the kettle meant relocating it to the nightstand because the cord didn’t comfortably reach the outlet on the desk. It worked for sleeping and showering, but any activity beyond that felt choreographed.",
        "source_3": "I spent a surprising amount of time in the lobby at Sunroute Plaza waiting for colleagues, and the design stood out. The space mixes charcoal sofas with brass accents, geometric pendant lights, and a clean-lined reception that keeps the area uncluttered. There’s a textured feature wall that gives the room a gallery feel, and the coffee tables have a low, minimalist profile that suits quick meet-ups. Music was kept soft, so conversations didn’t echo, and the lighting stayed warm without being dim. I noticed tasteful touches like planters and a few art books that made it feel curated rather than generic. It became our impromptu rendezvous point before heading to restaurants in the neighborhood.",
        "source_4": "For a short Tokyo visit, Sunroute Plaza worked well as a base. Check-in was smooth, and being a quick walk from Shinjuku Station meant we never worried about transfers or getting lost after dinner. The room was compact, but housekeeping kept the surfaces, bathroom, and linens in top shape throughout our three-night stay. We used the lobby as a comfortable spot to plan our days, and the surrounding area put shops and restaurants within a few minutes’ reach. Because everything was so close, we spent more time exploring and less time commuting. The setup matched what we wanted for a city break.",
        "source_5": "I was in Tokyo for a week on business and chose Sunroute Plaza mainly to be near Shinjuku Station, which made commuting simple. The room’s tight layout became a daily constraint: opening suitcases, laying out clothes, and setting up a laptop felt like arranging pieces in a puzzle. After long days, I wanted space to stretch or do a bit of light exercise, but there wasn’t anywhere to move without bumping into furniture. The desk supported the basics, though taking notes and juggling documents crowded fast. The lobby looked chic and comfortable, but my routine kept me mostly upstairs. Next time, I’ll trade a longer walk for a room with more breathing room.",
        "source_6": "I’m particular about cleanliness, and the housekeeping at Sunroute Plaza matched what I look for. Towels and linens were fresh daily, and the bathroom grout and fixtures looked recently scrubbed with no soap residue on the counter. I checked the corners and baseboards—no dust, and the vacuum lines on the carpet were visible after service. Trash was cleared consistently, and amenities like the kettle and cups were reset without fingerprints or water marks. The air felt neutral, without heavy fragrances or lingering odors. Over several nights, the room stayed orderly without me needing to ask for extra attention."
