        "source_1": "I’ve been using the phone as my main device for about two months, mostly for email, WhatsApp, and Maps during a 90‑minute commute. It handles switching between apps without hitching, and the fingerprint reader unlocks quickly even with slightly sweaty hands. Indoors the screen is easy on the eyes, but on a bright afternoon I need to push brightness to max to read small text. The back gets a bit warm during long voice calls, and with my routine (two SIMs, 4G always on) I plug in by evening to avoid dipping under 20%.",
        "source_2": "Focusing purely on gaming: I play Call of Duty Mobile and Asphalt 9 for about an hour after work. On default settings COD sits around 30 fps and drops during smoke/explosion scenes, with noticeable stutter after 15–20 minutes as the phone heats near the camera bump. Asphalt’s races start smooth and then feel choppy on busy tracks; reducing effects helps but doesn’t eliminate the dips. If gaming is the main use, the chipset runs, but it doesn’t hold steady frame rates under sustained load.",
        "source_3": "Just about the display: colors look slightly cool out of the box, and blacks appear more like dark gray when watching films in a dim room. Under direct sun, I have to shade the screen with my hand to read chat threads, and auto‑brightness sometimes overshoots and then dims a second later, which is distracting. Viewing angles are fine, but text edges aren’t as crisp as on a higher‑dpi panel when reading long PDFs. For indoor use the panel is pleasant; outdoors it takes effort.",
        "source_4": "Concentrating on the cameras: daytime photos of street scenes come out sharp with decent dynamic range, but indoor shots of my kid moving blur easily unless I tap to focus and hold still. Night mode brightens the frame yet introduces smudgy noise in shadow areas, and yellow streetlights push skin tones off. The front camera is ok for video calls, though it softens faces; 1080p clips look shaky when walking since stabilization is limited. Macro requires multiple tries to get a clean shot of small labels.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, I bought it for a work phone in this price band and set up two email accounts, Slack, and Office apps. It handles calendars, attachments, and 10–12 browser tabs without crashing, and notifications arrive on time. Call quality is clear in quiet rooms, but on a windy street the person on the other end says they hear gusts more than my voice. The mono speaker is loud enough for podcasts, though music sounds thin, so I use earbuds.",
        "source_6": "Battery and charging only: with push email, Bluetooth earbuds, an hour of YouTube, and 30 minutes of navigation, I average around 4.5–5 hours of screen‑on time and need a top‑up before bedtime. Overnight standby drains about 7–9% with both SIMs active, and mobile data seems to sip more than Wi‑Fi. A full charge from roughly 15% to 100% takes about two hours with the included brick. There’s no wireless charging, and the USB‑C port feels sturdy after repeated plugs."
