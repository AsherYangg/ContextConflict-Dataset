        "source_1": "I brewed this as a V60 pour-over (17 g coffee to 280 g water, 94°C, 2:45 total). The cup finished with a silky glide and a lingering aftertaste that reminded me of cedar and cocoa nibs. Even as it cooled, the finish stayed clean without that sharp bite that some medium roasts get. I noticed the smoothness most when sipping it black right after breakfast; it coated the palate and hung around for a few minutes in a pleasant way.",
        "source_2": "Using an AeroPress (inverted, 15 g to 220 g, 90°C, 2-minute steep, 20-second press), the most prominent note for me was a woodsy thread—think dry cedar shavings and a faint campfire edge—layered over toasted almond. With a teaspoon of raw sugar, that wood note tilted toward maple and felt comforting, like sitting near a pine fire. I didn’t pick up much fruit; the appeal here was that gentle forest vibe.",
        "source_3": "On a Chemex (1:15 ratio, 205°F, medium-coarse grind), the dominant flavor leaned into damp wood and potting-soil earthiness for me. It overshadowed any sweetness and left a dry, papery finish, a bit like chewing on a popsicle stick. I tried tightening the grind and lowering the water temp to 200°F on the next brew, but the same woody core stuck out and kept the cup from opening up.",
        "source_4": "After running through most of the bag in my drip machine and French press, I found it to be a steady daily cup. The aroma out of the grinder suggested toasted nuts; in the mug it played nicely both black and with a splash of oat milk. No harsh edge on weekdays when I brewed a quick 1:16 in the Mr. Coffee, and guests who usually lean toward Panera’s medium roast finished their cups without reaching for sugar. It felt easy to dial in and repeat.",
        "source_5": "Across the bag, I ran into inconsistency: a handful of lighter, underdeveloped-looking beans mixed in, and the fragrance on opening was surprisingly faint even with an intact valve. I had to bump my dose to 20 g per 300 g water and grind finer just to get some depth, yet the cups still came out flat and a bit hollow. Side-by-side with the Wegmans dark roast espresso beans (which I brew lightly as drip), this one needed more effort and still left me wanting more presence in the cup after a week of testing.",
        "source_6": "For espresso on a Rancilio Silvia (18 g in, 36 g out, 28–30 seconds at 93–95°C), the body felt thin and the crema dissipated quickly. Shots tasted muted, and in a 6 oz cappuccino the coffee got lost behind the milk. I tried a slightly finer grind and a 1:1.8 ratio to coax a syrupy texture, but it never developed that weighty mouthfeel I look for; Americanos came out tasting watery regardless of temp tweaks."
