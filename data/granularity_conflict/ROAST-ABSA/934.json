        "source_1": "I finished the course over four weeks and treated it like a structured study plan. The weekly modules nudged me to slow down and reason through the material, and I regularly set aside an hour after dinner to work through the lessons. The discussions and short reflections at the end of each video pushed me to actually write out what I understood before moving on, which kept me engaged across the full curriculum rather than skimming.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on the assignments: the problem sets felt like puzzles with moving parts, but the instructions sometimes left me guessing. For example, the third week’s project had an autograder that failed my solution with no clear hint about which edge case I’d missed, so I ended up iterating through half a dozen versions at 1 a.m. I wish the rubric called out specific test cases; I spent more time reverse-engineering the grading criteria than applying the week’s concept.",
        "source_3": "From a course-wide perspective, the lectures were breezy for me. I sped the videos up to 1.5x and still cleared the quizzes without pausing. The examples leaned on toy datasets and familiar scenarios, so I rarely had to pull out a notebook. I kept expecting a deeper challenge in the capstone but found the final task mirrored earlier exercises with slightly larger inputs.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the whole experience, the pacing and the weekly cadence worked well for me as a way to build a habit. I blocked off Sunday mornings to focus on the module’s ideas, then used the rest of the week to chip away at the tasks. The instructor encouraged sketching out solutions before touching the keyboard, and that practice changed how I approach similar problems at work. By the end, I had a set of notes and small scripts I actually reused.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on lecture clarity: the slides packed multiple dense formulas into single frames, and the voiceover rushed through them. I had to pause and redraw the diagrams because the transitions hid key steps. The examples mixed older library syntax with newer recommendations, which left me hopping between documentation pages trying to reconcile what I was seeing with what’s current.",
        "source_6": "Focusing strictly on assignment design: the weekly problem sets hit a sweet spot for me. I’d stumble on a boundary case, revisit the lesson, and then nail it on the second pass. The tasks escalated in a predictable way—first a warm-up, then a mid-sized scenario, then a final piece with a couple of tricky inputs. The hint sections were sparse but enough to point me toward the right abstraction without giving away the solution."
