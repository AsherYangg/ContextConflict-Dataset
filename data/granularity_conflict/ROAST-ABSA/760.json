        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the screen, so here’s my take after a week of heavy reading and streaming. Indoors it looks crisp, but in direct noon sun I have to peg brightness to 100% and it still feels a bit dim. Colors lean warm with punchy reds, and on darker scenes there’s some black crush that hides shadow detail. At very low brightness I notice slight flicker that gives me eyestrain during bedtime reading. Netflix plays at 1080p, yet white subtitles show a faint color fringe around the edges, which makes me suspect the subpixel layout rather than the resolution.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery: with dual SIM active and 5G on, I’m averaging about 6–7 hours of screen-on time with YouTube, Instagram, and Telegram. Overnight standby drains 8–10% even with Wi‑Fi off and background limits set. The 6000 mAh pack makes the phone feel dense; long scrolling sessions leave my wrist sore. Charging from 15% to full with the inbox adapter takes roughly 2 hours 20 minutes. Watching Prime Video with Dolby Atmos enabled seems to shave an extra chunk off compared to leaving it off, so I keep it toggled off on battery days.",
        "source_3": "I picked this up for my mom who watches K‑dramas and cricket highlights, and it’s been a comfortable daily device for her. The screen is vivid enough for binge sessions, and the combo of earpiece and bottom speaker gives decent stereo separation for dialogues. She’s seeing close to two days between charges with around 3–4 hours of screen time, mainly streaming and WhatsApp calls. Rear camera shots of our garden show nice detail and pleasant colors; the selfie camera softens skin a bit, which she doesn’t mind. We added a tempered glass on day one, and the phone’s finish still looks neat after a month in her purse.",
        "source_4": "Strictly on sound: the Dolby Atmos toggle changes the EQ, but through the built-in speakers the effect is modest. On Spotify, mids get a bump yet the stage still collapses toward the bottom-firing side at higher volumes. Watching action scenes, certain explosions start to buzz near max volume, while dialogue stays clear. Over USB‑C dongle with wired earbuds, the Atmos profiles feel more pronounced, especially on movies, but it’s not anywhere near a living‑room setup. I mostly leave it on for streaming and off for podcasts.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take after 10 days, the phone handles daily tasks smoothly, but the cameras aren’t quite the “wow” I expected. Daylight photos are fine, yet indoor shots introduce noise and smoothing; HDR sometimes blows out the sky while leaving faces flat. The front camera keeps nudging beauty effects even when sliders are low, and selfies against windows come out washed. Video stabilization helps a bit but adds wobble and focus hunting when walking. The display and speakers make Netflix enjoyable, though I wouldn’t rely on this for consistently sharp family photos.",
        "source_6": "I cared a lot about durability because I saw conflicting listings saying Gorilla Glass 4 in one place and 5 in another. Two weeks in a pocket with keys left faint micro‑scratches around the top edge, visible under sunlight. A waist‑height drop onto kitchen tile with a slim case caused a tiny frame dent and a hairline nick on the glass corner; it didn’t shatter, but the mark catches light during movies. I installed a tempered glass after that and haven’t had new marks. Whatever the exact glass spec, I treat the screen like it needs extra protection."
