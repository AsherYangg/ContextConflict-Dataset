        "source_1": "I keep a box of Stash peach tea at my desk for an afternoon break. One bag in an 8 oz mug at just-off-boil for about 5 minutes gives a clear peach note without veering into candy territory, and the base stays soft—more presence than a typical herbal, but nowhere near the punch of a breakfast blend. It never turns grassy, even if I forget and let it sit, which is why I rotate it with their Earl Grey and keep coming back to this brand after trying others.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the peach intensity: with one bag, the flavor sits in the background for me. I’ve tested 8 oz water at 200–205°F for 3, 5, and 7 minutes, and it still feels faint unless I either double-bag or cut the water to 6 oz. Two bags in a 12 oz travel mug finally deliver the level of fruit I’m after; otherwise, it drinks like lightly scented hot water, so I toss in a few pieces of dried peach to boost it.",
        "source_3": "Just speaking to body/strength: the cup stays very light. I tried one bag for 6 minutes and even pressed the bag at the end, and it never built the heft I look for. If you expect the weight you get from a black tea, this won’t supply it—I ended up blending it with a teaspoon of Assam to get the structure I want without overwhelming the peach.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, it smells like ripe fruit the moment you open the pouch, but in a hot cup the flavor trails behind the aroma for me. I’ve had better luck cold brewing overnight (two bags in a 16 oz jar in the fridge for about 12 hours), which pulls more peach into the sip and smooths the finish. For hot mornings I reach for something with more drive, but as a chilled drink with lunch it fits the bill.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on smoothness: even at a 6–7 minute steep, it doesn’t go bitter or grassy. The peach note stays gentle and clean, so I can drink it plain after dinner without it clashing with dessert. It’s forgiving of oversteeping, which makes it easy when I’m multitasking and forget the timer.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture view of the brand: Stash has been reliable for me—Earl Grey is my weekday staple—and this peach blend slides into the rotation when I want something softer. One bag comfortably flavors a 10–12 oz mug at work, and I like that it doesn’t demand sugar to taste balanced. I’ve sampled similar blends from grocery shelves that come off perfumey; this one reads more restrained and keeps me returning to Stash."
