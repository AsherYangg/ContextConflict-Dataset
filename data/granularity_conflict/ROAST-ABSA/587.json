        "source_1": "I booked two interconnecting Garden Wing rooms (514/516) for our family of four, and the setup made bedtime simple—kids in one room with the shared door open, adults next door with the balcony doors cracked for the evening breeze. The crib I requested was already in place with a fitted sheet, and the balcony had childproof latches that eased my mind. The only hiccup was early-morning noise from housekeeping carts on the corridor and a leaf blower in the courtyard around 6:30 a.m., which stirred our youngest. We ended up running a white-noise app and that solved it. For space, storage, and that easy back-and-forth at night, the interconnecting layout worked exactly as we needed.",
        "source_2": "I paid close attention to the service on this stay because I was traveling with my elderly mother. The bellman (Rahim) greeted us by name after day one and kept a wheelchair ready by the front steps at our usual 9 a.m. outing time. At breakfast, a server noted my mother’s low-sodium request and brought a made-to-order omelet without cheese or added salt without us asking twice. On the flip side, room service on Tuesday night quoted 30 minutes for congee and ginger tea and it arrived after 55, lukewarm, and turndown came at 8:45 p.m., right as my mother was dozing. When I mentioned it, housekeeping adjusted the schedule for the rest of the week and left extra water and tea bags proactively.",
        "source_3": "I came mainly for the buffet at The Line because friends raved about it. The spread is enormous—live noodle station turning out laksa, a grill where they skewered chicken satay to order, and a dessert counter with durian pengat that I kept going back for. At 7 p.m. on Saturday, we waited 25 minutes to be seated even with a reservation, and the seafood counter ran out of oysters twice within the first hour; they did replenish, but the line snaked around the salad bar. Coffee from the machine near the pastry section came out more tepid than I like, yet the staff happily pulled a fresh one from the bar when I asked. If you hit it outside peak times (we tried 8:30 p.m. the next day), the pacing and refills felt smoother.",
        "source_4": "Over the past few years I’ve stayed at three Singapore city properties, and this one consistently feels the most put-together for a longer trip. Check-in at 10:30 p.m. was quick, I was in room 733 within ten minutes, and the space smelled faintly of orchids rather than cleaning products. The gardens off the lobby give it a resort feel, which was a nice reset between meetings. It’s slightly off the main Orchard stretch, so I budgeted a 12–18 minute Grab to Raffles Place depending on traffic, and the walk to the MRT is a bit of a trek in the afternoon heat. Even with that, the combination of calm public spaces, a gym with working AC and plenty of towels, and a breakfast that doesn’t feel cramped kept me coming back.",
        "source_5": "Visiting for a three-day conference, I found the property gorgeous but not the quickest in-and-out base I needed. The lobby and pool areas were buzzing with families during the school holidays; getting an elevator at 9 a.m. sometimes meant waiting through two full cars. My room Wi‑Fi clocked 80–90 Mbps down, which handled Zoom calls fine, but the signal by the pool wobbled in and out. Check-in at 6 p.m. took about 15 minutes in a snaking line, and ride-hailing drivers occasionally overshot the Garden Wing drop-off because the entrance is tucked off the main road. For a vacation I can see the draw—lush gardens, big buffet—but for a tight business schedule, I’ll probably choose a smaller place next time."
