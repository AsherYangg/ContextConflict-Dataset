        "source_1": "I bought this specifically to chase crema on my 2‑cup Bialetti Brikka. Using 16 g of coffee, water up to the internal line, and a medium gas flame, the foam starts to rise but collapses within 20–30 seconds into a thin, spotty ring. The bubbles are large and airy rather than tight and moussy. I tried four runs—slightly cooler water, slightly lower flame, and a 0.5 g dose tweak—and got the same quick fade each time.",
        "source_2": "My focus is flavor and mouthfeel. Pulled on a stovetop moka, it gives a cocoa‑leaning cup with a hint of caramel and a clean finish; the texture feels silky on the tongue without any gritty edge. Acidity stays gentle, so I can sip it straight, but it also takes a teaspoon of sugar nicely for a little cafecito vibe. No ashiness or harsh aftertaste even as it cools.",
        "source_3": "As an everyday stovetop espresso option, this has been reliable for me. The grind packs cleanly in the Brikka basket, the can’s seal keeps the aroma lively after opening, and I get a dense, copper‑colored cap of crema most mornings in about 3–4 minutes. It pairs well with a splash of whole milk for a small cortado, and when guests come by, I can turn out four rounds quickly without fussing over the flame or timing. One can sees me through a workweek of early brews.",
        "source_4": "Opened a fresh can and was met with a sharp, tinny scent; in the basket there’s a lot of powdery fines that made my Brikka sputter and stall. Even with careful heat control, the cup swings between hollow and bitter, like it’s over‑extracting in spots and under‑extracting in others. I moved the grounds to an airtight jar and tried over several days, but the flavor stayed muted and slightly papery for me. Compared side by side with my usual moka blend, this one just never settled into a balanced pour.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on strength: two demitasse cups before my 7 a.m. commute still left me yawning by mid‑morning. I kept the dose at 15–16 g and brew time around 3 minutes on a consistent flame; compared with a darker Italian roast I use, the lift here feels much gentler. I had to add an extra half scoop to get the same alertness, which pushed the shot toward a heavier, muddier profile, so for me the caffeine punch is on the mild side."
