    "content": {
        "source_1": "I run a multi-dog household with a 105 lb Dutch Shepherd, a 62 lb German Shepherd, a 7 lb Chihuahua, and a revolving door of foster dogs. I soak the Olewo Carrots and Red Beets for about 10 minutes (roughly 1 tsp per 10 lbs of body weight) and mix it into their morning and evening meals. New intakes usually go straight from shelter food to our kibble plus this mix, and we haven’t had mealtime refusals. On weekend trial runs to training classes and road trips, everyone kept normal stools, and the shepherds’ coats settled into a deeper color that’s noticeable in the sun. It’s become part of our routine because the whole crew eats it without picking around the bowl.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on digestion: my 12-year-old beagle has a sensitive gut, so I introduced this extremely slowly—half a teaspoon soaked and mixed into dinner for a week, then up to a teaspoon. Even at that tiny amount, his stools turned soft and we had a couple of urgent late-night trips outside. I removed the beet/carrot mix and things normalized within a day. Tried again a week later with the same result. No other diet changes were made (same kibble, same treats), so for this dog at least, it didn’t sit well.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on coat condition only: my black Lab has been on the carrots and beets for eight weeks, measured and soaked per the label. I took before-and-after photos in the same lighting and can’t pick out a difference in shine or color depth. His topcoat still feels the same coarse texture, and brushing sessions yield about the same amount of hair as before. Nails, ears, and skin checks at the vet were normal, so nothing else seems off—just no visible coat change tied to this addition.",
        "source_4": "Overall take from a small pack: two 55–60 lb mixed breeds took to the soaked mix right away, but my 4 lb Chihuahua refuses her meal if she smells even a half teaspoon in it, wet or dry. The beet component turns everything bright red, which has stained a couple of kitchen mats and a white snuffle mat—lesson learned there. A recent foster adjusted after three days, but the first two days came with extra gas. On the plus side, the big dogs finish their bowls and handled a weekend agility trial and a long car ride without any bathroom surprises.",
        "source_5": "Single-aspect—palatability only: my Siberian Husky is notorious for leaving supplements behind, so I tested this by soaking a teaspoon of the pellets until the water turned magenta and mixing it with his evening kibble. He cleaned the bowl three nights in a row and even licked the edges, which he never does with add-ins. The earthy smell is strong out of the bag but calms down after soaking, and it doesn’t seem to trigger his usual pickiness."
