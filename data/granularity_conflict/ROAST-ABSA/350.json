        "source_1": "I finished the course over four weeks, watching two or three videos each evening after work. The clips run about 8–12 minutes and end with a short recap, which made it easy to pause and return without losing the thread. The weekly quizzes lined up with what was covered, and the reading packets never felt like a dump; I kept a notebook and could actually map concepts from the lectures to two or three articles per week. Professor Edwin Bakker keeps a steady pace, and the structure—intro, case vignette, framework, quick check—matched what I hoped an online class would feel like. I took Moral Foundations of Politics last year, and this fit right beside it in terms of organization and clarity.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the readings: the list is heavy, and a chunk of it feels redundant. In Week 2 I counted 10 separate links, with two pointing to the same policy brief via different mirrors. A couple PDFs were scanned copies with faint text, and one journal link was behind a paywall unless I went through my university library. The curation leans on 2010–2013 sources, and several pieces rehash similar typologies. I ended up skimming because the load didn’t match the time estimates on the syllabus.",
        "source_3": "Only about Professor Bakker’s delivery: he presents with a whiteboard and simple slides, walking through models step by step—definition, scope, example, limitation. In one lecture he drew a flowchart of decision paths and then applied it to a case in three passes, which made it stick. He avoids jargon unless he’s defined it, and he circles back with a two-minute summary, so my notes naturally fall into headings and bullet points. If you like a calm, classroom-style explanation rather than flashy edits, this format works.",
        "source_4": "As an overall experience, this didn’t land for me. The lectures spend a lot of time naming categories and less time interrogating assumptions, so the discussions felt surface level. Weekly quizzes leaned on wording from the slides, and the peer forum threads rarely moved past first impressions; I stopped posting after Week 3 because prompts didn’t invite debate. Coming off Ian Shapiro’s course, where readings are challenged in the videos and office hours push back on arguments, I wanted more depth and fewer definitions here.",
        "source_5": "Only on the “free” aspect: auditing lets you watch everything, but graded quizzes and the final share-lock behind the paid track. I applied for financial aid and waited almost two weeks, which meant I missed one deadline and had to switch to the next session. The certificate also costs extra, and some features—like peer feedback rubrics and assignment resubmissions—didn’t show up on my audit view. If you’re expecting a fully no-cost path with the same experience, plan around those constraints."
