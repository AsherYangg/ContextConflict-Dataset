        "source_1": "I booked a standard double for a work trip and was impressed by the sheer size of the room. I could open two suitcases flat on the floor and still have space to walk around. There was a long desk that fit my 16-inch laptop and paperwork, a small sofa, and a wide window ledge where I ate a late-night snack. High ceilings and a big window made it feel airy, and I even had enough room to roll out a yoga mat in the morning without moving furniture.",
        "source_2": "Speaking only about sleep quality: the mattress felt medium-firm with a cushioned top, and they provided two pillow types (one flatter, one thicker), which helped my neck. The duvet wasn’t overly heavy, and the AC held a steady 20°C without cycling loudly. With the blackout curtains drawn, I slept straight through my alarm, so for anyone who cares most about the bed and darkness, this checked the boxes.",
        "source_3": "As a non-smoker, the air in my room was a problem from the moment I opened the door. The odor clung to the curtains and carpet, and my clothes picked it up after just one night. The front desk explained they don’t offer non-smoking rooms, so they brought up a spray and suggested running the AC on high; I also cracked the window for an hour. Even after that, the scent lingered in the linens, and I woke up with it in my hair. If you’re sensitive to cigarette residue, plan accordingly.",
        "source_4": "About breakfast and pricing: I assumed it was included and only found out at check-in that it wasn’t. Rather than pay extra, I crossed the road to the bakery that opens at 7:00 a.m. and grabbed a cappuccino and a warm ham-and-cheese croissant for less than what a hotel buffet typically costs. They had plenty of options—fruit tarts, yogurt cups, and fresh bread—so I ended up going there both mornings and was out the door quickly.",
        "source_5": "For an overall view, my room had tons of space and the bed itself was easy to relax on, but the cigarette smell was noticeable in both the hallway and the room, and there wasn’t a non-smoking option available. I kept the window open whenever I was inside, which helped a bit. Breakfast wasn’t part of the rate, though the bakery across the street made mornings simple with coffee and pastries right at 7 a.m. If room size and a decent sleep setup are your priorities, it delivers; if you’re sensitive to smoke, it may be a trade-off."
