        "source_1": "I signed up mainly for the video content, and the lectures felt tightly organized. The instructor would introduce a term, write out a small numeric example on the whiteboard, and then switch to a short notebook demo that mirrored the slides. The chapter markers made it easy to jump back to the part on regularization, and the end-of-week recaps listed the exact steps we were expected to reproduce. I rarely had to pause or rewatch to understand what to implement in the next assignment.",
        "source_2": "The assignments took me in circles because the instructions were too open-ended. In Week 3 the prompt said to “clean the data and engineer features,” but never specified which columns to drop or how to handle the categorical fields. The autograder kept throwing “dimension mismatch” errors without pointing to which function signature was off, and the rubric didn’t mention that they expected standardization before the train/test split. I burned two evenings rewriting the pipeline and still had to poke the grader thread to guess what was actually required.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the course as a whole, the pacing jumped around: Week 1 felt light, then Week 4 suddenly packed in notation and new metrics without much transition. I spent extra time going back and forth with the grader on small formatting details, which stretched simple tasks into multi-night chores. The learner forum helped me unblock a few times with shared notebooks and hints from peers, but the overall flow never quite settled. If I were starting today, I’d probably begin with the University of Washington’s Machine Learning course, which struck me as more streamlined in explanations and project structure.",
        "source_4": "My schedule is tight, and I could finish each module in a single evening. The videos plus quizzes took about an hour, and the coding task another hour or so with the provided starter notebook. The autograder gave a green check on the first upload most weeks, so I didn’t need to chase clarifications or resubmit. Across the month, I spent roughly 5–6 hours total and didn’t feel pressed for time.",
        "source_5": "I focused heavily on the discussion forums, and they were a lifesaver. I posted a question about feature scaling around midnight and a mentor replied within twenty minutes with a step-by-step checklist and a tiny code snippet that matched the course API. The TAs ran a weekly office hour on Zoom where they walked through common grading pitfalls, and an instructor jumped into a long thread to resolve a scoring glitch by the next day. The pinned guides (especially the one on cross-validation syntax) saved me from multiple wrong turns."
