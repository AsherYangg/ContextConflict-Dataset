        "source_1": "I booked two nights and focused mostly on the room’s condition. The walls showed their years with a few scuffs and a bubble of paint near the AC vent, and the dresser drawers stuck unless you pulled them just right. The armchair’s fabric had a shiny worn patch on the arms, and the bathroom tiles had hairline cracks by the threshold. It all worked, but the finishes told a story of long use.",
        "source_2": "I paid attention to the room’s design because I work remotely and notice details. Mine looked freshly done: crisp paint without marks, a modern headboard with padded panels, and brushed-steel lamps with built-in USB ports. The carpet felt springy underfoot, and the TV offered streaming apps without lag. I didn’t come across the usual tired furniture you sometimes expect in older buildings.",
        "source_3": "I was traveling on a tight food budget, so the small kitchenette mattered. The mid-size fridge kept fruit and sandwich fixings cold, and the microwave handled reheating takeout from the International Market across the street. No cooktop, but there was a small sink and enough counter space to prep snacks. We stashed beach drinks in the fridge and avoided breakfast lines by toasting bagels with a portable toaster we brought.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression: For the amount I paid, the stay felt fair. I chose a room with two doubles, which left more floor space to move around and set down luggage than a king would. Location worked well—I crossed to the International Market via the corner crosswalk and reached the beach in about 10–12 minutes at a casual pace. The front desk pointed me to the complimentary trolley; I rode it twice and got dropped near the mall’s food court.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on location with kids in tow, the “walking distance” claim didn’t play out for us the same way. The sidewalks were crowded at sunset, so it took almost 20 minutes to reach the sand with a stroller and beach gear. Crossing near the market involved two long signals, and the complimentary trolley we tried was packed once and delayed another time. We ended up waiting so long that rideshare felt easier.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture take: We booked a king room and the bed dominated the layout, making it tricky to navigate around the footboard with a suitcase and a stroller. The fridge in the kitchenette cycled loudly at night, so we unplugged it after storing drinks in ice. The bed itself was fine, but the room would have breathed better with two doubles. Being across from the market was handy for grabbing quick bites, though getting to the beach with gear was more of a shuffle than a stroll."
