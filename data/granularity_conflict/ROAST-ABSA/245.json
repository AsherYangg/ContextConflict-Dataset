        "source_1": "I keep both Pamela’s Baking & Pancake Mix and Bob’s Red Mill GF Pancake Mix in the pantry. On weekday mornings I whisk 1 cup mix with 3/4 cup milk and an egg, heat a nonstick griddle to about 350°F, and do 1/4-cup pours. Bob’s spreads a little thinner and cooks evenly with crisp edges and a tender center; Pamela’s puffs higher and turns dense unless I really loosen the batter. My kids empty their plates with Bob’s; Pamela’s gets repurposed as leftover snacks. Funny enough, I still reach for Pamela’s when I bake muffins or coffee cake—just not for pancakes.",
        "source_2": "Texture notes only: side-by-side test on a cast-iron skillet at medium heat, 1/4-cup scoops, same butter, same timing. Pamela’s batter thickened as it sat, and the pancakes developed a tight crumb and a slight rubbery chew in the middle, especially on the second batch. Bob’s stayed pourable, made lacy edges, and had a more open crumb. Letting Pamela’s rest for 10 minutes actually made it stodgier; adding an extra splash of milk helped, but then the centers went a bit custardy.",
        "source_3": "Overall take from a rushed parent: I stick to Pamela’s for pancakes because it’s the only mix that gives me consistent results before school. I whisk 1 cup mix with 1 cup 2% milk, 1 egg, and a teaspoon of oil, let it sit 5 minutes, and do thin pours on a 325–350°F griddle. They come off with a smooth, even crumb and golden tops without having to fuss with the heat. My GF teen eats them plain with fruit, which never happens with other mixes that turn out gritty.",
        "source_4": "Family approval only: my 7- and 10-year-olds can tell which mix I used without me saying a word. With Bob’s, they ask for seconds and don’t drown them in syrup. When I use Pamela’s straight from the bag per directions, they leave half a pancake behind and say it’s “too bready.” Same skillet, same butter, same maple—only the mix changes the outcome.",
        "source_5": "Convenience vs homemade: I’ve tried from-scratch GF pancakes with rice, tapioca, and sorghum flours, weighed to the gram, and they eat up 20 minutes I don’t have at 6:30 a.m. The mixes, especially Bob’s, get me out the door faster, and the texture isn’t worse for us—if anything, thinner pours from the mix give a more uniform surface than my scratch batches. I’ll save homemade for weekends; on weekdays, the mix wins on effort-to-result ratio."
