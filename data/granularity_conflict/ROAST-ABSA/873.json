        "source_1": "I bought this tin after liking a café’s powered matcha latte and expected something similar at home. Using 1 teaspoon in 8 ounces of about 175°F water, it came across strongly marine, a lot like seaweed, with a briny finish. I tried to tame it with 1 teaspoon of sugar, a few scrapes of fresh ginger, and a splash of 2% milk, which took the edge off enough to get through a cup. Even after sifting and hitting it with a 200‑watt handheld blender for around 20 seconds, I still had streaks on the surface and a layer of green grit at the bottom.",
        "source_2": "Narrow take on prep/solubility: I only drink matcha straight and care about how it dissolves. I preheat the bowl, sift 2 grams (about a heaping chashaku) into it, add 60 ml of 170–175°F filtered water, and whisk in fast “M” motions for 20 seconds with a bamboo chasen. It consistently gives me a tight microfoam with no clumps and nothing settling after a couple of minutes. The flavor reads as fresh-cut grass with gentle umami to me, no seaweed notes, so I finish the bowl without any sugar or milk.",
        "source_3": "Price-only perspective: Amazon had the 100 g bag at $14.99 for me, while my neighborhood grocery lists the same size at $18.99 before tax. With a 10% Subscribe & Save and a clipped $2 coupon, my checkout total landed at $11.49 delivered next day. I did a similar check on the sweet potato chips—Amazon’s 12‑pack cost me $19.20 ($1.60 per bag), and the shelf tag at my local store was $2.29 per bag. For my budget tracking spreadsheet, the online route came out ahead.",
        "source_4": "Different price experience here: my local Asian market sells a 100 g pouch for $8.99 every day, and the Amazon option I saw was $12.99 plus $5.49 shipping, so the per‑ounce cost worked out higher online. On the chips, Target ran a two‑for‑$5 promo last week, whereas the multi‑pack in my Amazon cart averaged about $2.75 a bag after tax. Between gas and time, I still came out spending less by grabbing both items in person that week.",
        "source_5": "Overall take on the order: I grabbed the matcha along with the sweet potato chips to restock snacks and morning drinks. The chips have that light, crispy snap and a clean sweet potato flavor that goes well with a turkey sandwich; I went through three mini bags before the weekend was over. The tea leaned oceanic on my tongue and only settled down once I added sugar, grated ginger, and a bit of milk, and I noticed some tiny clumps even after frothing. As a bundle, I’m happy with the spend because the chips will get finished quickly, but I’ll try a different tea on my next round."
