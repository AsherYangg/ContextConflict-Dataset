        "source_1": "I’m only commenting on charging. Over the past three weeks, I’ve been able to plug in during a 25-minute lunch break and watch it climb from around 12% to just over 70%. A quick five-minute top‑up before leaving the house typically gives me enough for the commute home. I charge with the brick from the box, and the phone doesn’t get uncomfortably warm. The percentage ticks up fast at the start, then slows near the top, but I’m still seeing a full charge in under an hour when starting below 20%.",
        "source_2": "In terms of raw performance, this thing keeps up with me. I bounce between Gmail, Maps, Sheets, Slack, and a couple of social apps while streaming music, and I don’t see slowdowns. I edited a 1080p clip for Instagram with some color tweaks and export finished quicker than my older phone. Games like Asphalt and Call of Duty run smoothly on default settings, and app switching feels instant. Scrolling through long news feeds stays fluid even with lots of images loading.",
        "source_3": "The software behavior has been unpredictable. Several times a day, I tap an app and nothing happens—no splash screen, no error—then after a few seconds I get a pop‑up saying the app isn’t working. When it does open, the touch input occasionally stops registering; the screen looks alive but taps and swipes don’t do anything until I lock and unlock, and sometimes I have to reboot. I tried clearing cache and even reinstalling a couple of apps (WhatsApp and my bank), but the issue came back within hours. The last security patch didn’t change this.",
        "source_4": "After a month of use, the phone has handled my routine well. I take calls, message clients, shoot quick product photos, and the day’s tasks go through without fuss. The charge I get in the morning lasts me through work, and if I forget, a short plug‑in while making coffee gets me enough to leave on time. I did see two instances where an app froze on a black screen, but it resolved after closing it from the recent apps view. For everyday reliability and speed, it’s been a solid daily driver for me.",
        "source_5": "I bought this for my small business, and the instability has cost me time. Twice at the checkout counter, my POS app refused to open, then threw an “app isn’t working” message while a customer waited. On another occasion, the touch stopped responding right as I was approving a bank transfer; the screen looked fine but taps didn’t register until a restart. When it runs, it moves quickly and processes orders fast, but I can’t predict when the freeze will happen, so I carry a backup device now."
