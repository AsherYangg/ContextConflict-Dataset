        "source_1": "I’ve bought Blue Mountain beans for years, mostly from Mavis Bank, so I was curious about this Wallenford Blue bag labeled “100% Jamaica Blue Mountain.” The moment I opened it, a lot of the beans looked mismatched—some small and oval, others larger and flat, plus a handful of pale quakers and chipped pieces. There was no JACRA hologram anywhere on the bag, just a printed batch code on the back. Brewed 22 g in a V60 at 1:16 with 93°C water, 3:00 total time, and even after tweaking grind on my Encore from 16 down to 12, the cup stayed harsh and thin. I set up a side-by-side with a half-bag of certified Blue Mountain I had left and the difference was obvious: the certified beans were uniformly sized, cleaner, and produced a rounder brew. Based on appearance and the way it brewed, this feels like High Mountain coffee sold under a different banner.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on packaging and certification only: my bag arrived vacuum-tight in a foil pouch with a one-way valve and a nitrogen flush note on the label. There’s a JACRA sticker with a serial number that matches the format I’ve seen on other certified Jamaican bags, plus an embossed Wallenford seal near the top seam. Roast date was stamped two weeks prior, net weight 16 oz, and the import info points to a known distributor. The inner bag had a proper degassing valve placement and clean seals, and the lot code was printed on both the outer and inner surfaces. From the packaging and markers alone, this looks like it follows the official standards.",
        "source_3": "I’m a stickler for aroma, so that’s what I paid attention to. On opening, the kitchen picked up a mix of cocoa and cedar with a light floral lift—think orange blossom more than jasmine—and a whisper of toasted hazelnut. Grinding at 18 on a Baratza Encore released a sweet, buttery scent that lingered for a good half hour, and when I did a quick bloom on the V60 the steam carried a gentle citrus note. Even after storing the beans in an airtight canister for a week, the nose stayed pretty consistent: mellow, nutty, and slightly perfumed.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, I brewed these both as espresso and pour-over and had satisfying results. For espresso on a Profitec, I ran 18 g in, 36 g out in about 28 seconds and got layered sweetness—cane sugar and buttered toast—with a soft stone-fruit edge and low bite. On the V60, 20 g to 300 g at 94°C with a 45-second bloom, it yielded a calm cup that worked nicely with a splash of cream. The beans in my bag were uniform and matte, not glossy, and the roast looked like a true medium. Shipping was quick (three days to Boston), and the price felt steep but fair for a weekend treat.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on extraction behavior: these beans gave me a tough time on espresso. On a Breville Barista Pro, grinder at 3 and 17 g in the basket, shots kept channeling and produced a thin crema even with careful puck prep (WDT and a paper puck screen). I checked TDS with a cheap refractometer and kept landing around 1.15% on longer shots, which is unusually low for my setup. The beans had lots of chaff, a few divots, and quite a bit of variance in size, and my French press trial (24 g to 360 g, 4:30 steep) came out silty with a hollow mid-palate. It all points to tricky extraction rather than my gear, since my usual Colombian lot pulls cleanly under the same routine."
