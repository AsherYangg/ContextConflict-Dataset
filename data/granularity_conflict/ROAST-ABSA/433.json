        "source_1": "I left the coffee in the original bag, folded it over twice, and clamped it with a binder clip, pressing air out through the little one-way valve each night. I brew a single 12-ounce pour-over every morning. By the third week, the bag still released a noticeable aroma when I pressed the valve, and the grounds produced a clear bloom on the first pour—pretty similar to how I used to store ground coffee before the K-cup era.",
        "source_2": "I stored the grounds exactly as instructed—kept them in the original bag with a clip and used the one-way valve to push air out. After about a week, the smell tapered off and the bag puffed up again overnight. The grounds started to clump a bit, and I needed an extra scoop in my drip machine to get the same strength I had on day one.",
        "source_3": "I paid $11.99 for the 2 lb bag with a clipped coupon, which worked out to roughly $0.19 per ounce. At two scoops per 12-ounce mug, my per-cup cost comes out under thirty cents. The house brand at my neighborhood grocery is closer to $0.32 per ounce, so this stretches my breakfast budget for the month.",
        "source_4": "I ended up at $15.49 for a 12 oz bag after tax and shipping, which is more than $20 per pound. For comparison, my warehouse club’s medium roast lands around $12 per pound. On a per-cup basis, this pushes me into the same range as some name brands, so I’m not seeing a savings here.",
        "source_5": "I’ve run this through a basic Mr. Coffee drip maker on weekdays and made a small cold brew concentrate on weekends. Flavor leans toward cocoa and roasted nuts without a harsh edge, and it’s easy to drink black. The bag’s one-way valve makes nightly storage simple—fold, clip, press the air out. After two weeks, my weekday cups were consistent, and at $13.99 for the bag I bought, the cost per mug lands in a comfortable range for me.",
        "source_6": "I tested it across a V60 and a French press using a 1:16 ratio. The V60 cups came out on the thin side unless I added an extra half scoop, and the French press lacked aroma compared with other bags I’ve opened recently. Even with the valve-and-clip routine, the smell faded noticeably by day three. At $14.99 for my order, the results didn’t match what I usually get from similarly priced coffee."
