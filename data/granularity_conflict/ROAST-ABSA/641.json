        "source_1": "I usually avoid diet snacks because of the weird aftertaste, but this surprised me. I did a little blind taste test at home: I handed one to my partner and he guessed it was a regular dessert cup. The flavor comes across as rich—think vanilla with a caramel note—and it doesn’t have that icy, watery feel. We served it chilled after dinner, and even my neighbor who isn’t counting calories asked where to buy it.",
        "source_2": "As someone tracking macros for training, I zoom in on the label. One cup is 100 calories, 9g protein, 7g carbs with 4g fiber, sweetened with erythritol and stevia. The numbers fit my plan, but two nights in a row I noticed bloating and a dry-mouth sensation afterward. If you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols, it’s worth noting because I felt fine with plain Greek yogurt but this gave me a weird stomach gurgle.",
        "source_3": "I’m judging it as a whole purchase from Amazon Fresh. The box arrived with one cup sealed but dented and another with the foil partly lifted, which made me toss them. The remaining portions were fine and handy for quick snacks, yet the packaging issues overshadowed the convenience since I ended up with less than I paid for. Delivery was on time; the quality control on seals wasn’t great.",
        "source_4": "Only commenting on texture: it’s smooth for the first spoonful, then a faint chalky grit shows up, like undissolved protein powder. I chilled one overnight and tried another at room temp; colder worked better but still gave me that powdery mouthfeel. When blended into a smoothie with half a banana, the grit disappears, so it’s the stand-alone experience that feels off to me.",
        "source_5": "Big-picture take: it slides nicely into my routine. I keep a couple in the fridge for post-dinner cravings and haven’t touched the ice cream pint all week. My two kids grabbed them without realizing they’re low-cal, and the portions actually feel satisfying. Price at my local store was $6.49 for a four-pack, which is higher than pudding cups but lower than premium protein desserts, so it’s become a regular line item in my grocery budget.",
        "source_6": "Just assessing sweetness level: this leans very sweet, almost birthday-cake sweet. After the first cup, I started mixing half with plain Greek yogurt to tone it down, which worked. If you like bold sweetness, it’ll hit that note; if you prefer subtle, be ready to dilute or pair it with something unsweetened."
