        "source_1": "I enrolled in January and wrapped up in about six weeks while working full-time. The path moved from basic Python to file handling, then into web scraping with BeautifulSoup and a short detour into SQL. The weekly quizzes were fair, and the coding tasks pushed me to write small utilities, like a script that parses mail logs and tallies senders. The capstone had me pull data from an API and stash it in SQLite; I demoed that at work to automate a monthly report. Videos played smoothly on my home connection, and the flexible deadlines kept me on track without stress.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the practical class sessions here: the Friday labs listed in the announcements were chaotic. Two weeks in a row the Zoom link changed a few minutes before start, the cloud notebooks were slow to spin up, and by the time my kernel loaded, the instructor had already moved on from setup. Breakout rooms had a dozen people each, so only a couple of us got code reviewed. I brought a failing test case from the “email data” assignment, but the TA asked me to post it on the forum instead, which made the live slot feel more like a webinar than hands-on help.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about the faculty: Dr. Charles Severance kept concepts approachable with concrete stories and deliberate debugging. In the HTML parsing lesson he introduced a small error on purpose, then read the stack trace line by line to show how to isolate it—super helpful when I hit UnicodeDecodeError later. The team watched the forums; when I asked about UTF-8 issues, they replied with timestamps to a specific clip that addressed it. The historical asides about protocols and the early web broke up the coding nicely without derailing the flow.",
        "source_4": "Only about the Coursera platform experience: the iOS app kept resetting my progress for Week 3, so the certificate stayed locked even after I passed the quiz. Calendar reminders arrived in Pacific time despite my profile being set to IST, which threw off my study slots. Support initially sent canned steps about clearing cache and reinstalling; it took a week before someone manually reset my course state. I also saw video quality drop to 144p on a fast connection, while other apps streamed fine.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the course got me from zero to writing short scripts, but the pacing jumps were rough. Weeks 1–2 moved quickly, then JSON and SQL landed back-to-back and ate an entire weekend. The auto-grader was strict about filenames and whitespace; my solution produced the right output locally but failed three times until I matched the exact casing. The final project outline was clear, yet the sample datasets were tiny, so I went hunting for a public API to make it worthwhile. I finished, just needed more hours than the estimate suggested."
