        "source_1": "I bought this for my toddler expecting a beef-forward puree, but when I opened the 4 oz jar the aroma reminded me more of marinara than stew. The color leaned orange-red, and on tasting it myself I mostly got tomato with herbs and barely any meaty depth. After three spoonfuls my kid pushed the spoon away, and I ended up mixing in plain mashed potatoes to chase the beef note I couldn’t find.",
        "source_2": "As a quick dinner on a busy night, this worked out well for us. I squeezed the pouch into a bowl, warmed it for about 15 seconds, and my son finished it without fuss. There’s a noticeable tomato tang, but it didn’t overwhelm him, and the texture was smooth enough to go through a soft-spout cup. For something shelf-stable, the flavor felt balanced and not heavy.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on the acidity: this stew ran sharper than I expected for a baby meal. I tasted it first and it had a lemony edge on the tongue that lingered, which led me to stir in rice cereal to soften the bite. Even after cutting it, my daughter burped a lot and had some spit-ups, which we don’t usually see when the puree is less tart.",
        "source_4": "I was surprised by how much beef character I picked up despite tomatoes being high on the ingredient list. The scent was savory right out of the pouch, and there were tiny shreds that gave a gentle stew vibe without any tough bits. I tried a spoonful and got a warm, broth-like depth that felt closer to pot roast than tomato soup.",
        "source_5": "Taking the product as a whole, it felt a bit watery with a thin layer separating at the top when I peeled back the lid. The taste leaned heavily into tomato, almost like pizza sauce, and I kept waiting for the stew flavor to show up. My baby accepted two small spoonfuls, then turned away and clamped shut, so I stored the rest but ended up tossing it later.",
        "source_6": "Texture-only observations: the puree is extremely smooth, almost velvety, with only an occasional soft carrot fleck—no chunks to worry about. It spreads easily on toast strips and mixes evenly into oatmeal without clumping. I would have liked a slightly thicker body so it stays on the spoon better, but it stayed consistent from first stir to the last spoonful and didn’t separate once warmed."
