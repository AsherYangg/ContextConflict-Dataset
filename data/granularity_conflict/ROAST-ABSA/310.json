        "source_1": "I audited just the lecture videos and slides. The decks use tiny fonts with dense bullet points that are tough to read on a laptop, and the instructor switches between slides and handwriting so quickly that the flow breaks. In Week 3, during the gradient descent derivation, several algebra steps are skipped and the stylus ink is faint. Captions lag by a couple of seconds, so I found myself pausing and rewinding every minute to keep up with the notation.",
        "source_2": "I focused solely on the programming assignments. Each homework had me implement algorithms from scratch in Octave/Python, and the autograder returned useful diffs when my predictions were off. The logistic regression task took about 9 hours; learning to vectorize cut runtime from a minute to a few seconds. The optional regularization tuning challenge nudged me to plot learning curves and diagnose overfitting, and by the fourth assignment I could trace shape mismatches without guessing.",
        "source_3": "I completed the course over eight weeks, averaging 6–8 hours per week. I needed to revisit some math, and the discussion boards were unusually helpful—the course mentor posted step-by-step debugging tutorials for gradient checks and broadcasting errors. The linear algebra review refreshed matrix multiplication and eigenvalues at the right moment. By the end, I could explain the bias–variance tradeoff to a coworker and build a regularized logistic regression from a blank notebook.",
        "source_4": "I enrolled as a beginner and found the pace brisk from the first module. Assignments regularly took entire weekends, and small numerical differences triggered autograder failures I didn’t know how to interpret. The mentor posts were detailed but assumed comfort with the chain rule and summation notation, and the lectures moved through derivations faster than I could absorb. After four weeks I still couldn’t derive the logistic regression cost function on my own, and I stepped away before the final unit.",
        "source_5": "I spent two evenings on the linear algebra review only. It jumps from dot products to eigenvectors in a single video with few fully worked examples, and the practice items are mostly multiple choice without step-by-step solutions. When I hit the section that uses matrix calculus in the main course, I still wasn’t confident about gradient shapes, so I had to pull explanations from an external textbook."
