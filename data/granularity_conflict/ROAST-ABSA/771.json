        "source_1": "I booked this mainly for proximity to Union Square, and it’s definitely close—about a three-minute walk if you cut across Geary. That said, the block gets loud after dark with sirens and bus brakes screeching, and I could hear the cable car bell at 5:30 a.m. My room faced the street, so even with the window closed there was a steady hum of traffic. Getting to and from Powell Street BART with a carry-on meant dragging it up a hill, which wasn’t ideal after a long flight.",
        "source_2": "My experience was all about the front desk and concierge. I arrived around 10 p.m. to find my prepaid reservation “missing” in the system; it took about 15 minutes and a couple of phone calls before they located it. I had reserved a king but was given two doubles because “nothing else was ready,” and I waited another 40 minutes while they tried to switch it. The concierge the next morning couldn’t find a nearby pharmacy that opened before 7 a.m., handed me a generic map, and suggested I “check Google,” which I had already done. The bellman who stored my bag was the bright spot—quick and organized—but overall the check-in felt drawn out.",
        "source_3": "I’m picky about the room itself, so here’s what stood out in 1214. The mattress dipped in the center, so I kept sliding toward the middle during the night. The pillows were thick but had that crunchy fill that rustles. I noticed a light film of dust on the headboard and two long hairs stuck near the shower drain when I first arrived. The thermostat claimed 68°F, but the air felt a bit stale, and the window was painted shut, so no fresh breeze. On the plus side, housekeeping brought extra towels within ten minutes when I called.",
        "source_4": "I came for a weekend getaway and had an easy stay from start to finish. Check-in took under five minutes, and the agent greeted me by name without prompting. The queen room felt fresh: crisp linens, a mattress that didn’t dip, and blackout shades that actually blocked the morning sun. I ate downstairs one night—seared salmon with seasonal vegetables—and the pacing between courses was smooth. The server kept my water topped up without hovering. Being a block from Union Square made it simple to grab coffee and meet friends, and rideshares found the entrance fast. I’d book the same place next time.",
        "source_5": "Stayed three nights with my partner. We liked being able to walk to Union Square and catch the cable car on Powell, and the lobby has a nice look to it. Sleep was tricky, though—the walls felt thin, and we could hear the neighbor’s TV plus the elevator chime in the hallway. Breakfast from the hotel restaurant came lukewarm one morning, and the hallway on our floor had a lingering chemical cleaner smell. Our rate was $279 per night plus taxes and fees, and for what we got, I’m planning to try a different hotel next visit.",
        "source_6": "I only tried the hotel restaurant for dinner, and it was a mixed outing. I ordered mushroom risotto and a glass of pinot; the rice was still chalky in the center, and there was a 20-minute gap between my appetizer and the main. The server checked in and offered a dessert to make up for it—the chocolate torte was well done with a good crust. My bill was $52 before tip, which felt high for the quality of the entree, so I’d probably eat elsewhere and just stop here for dessert."
