        "source_1": "I ordered the variety bag through Prime and had it on my porch the next afternoon, so no stock drama on my end. Every color actually tastes different, with a bright fruit note and a sour edge that wakes up the tongue without wrecking it. If I leave a piece parked on my cheek it starts to prickle after half a minute, so I roll it around and the sensation evens out. Price-wise I paid about fifty cents an ounce, which undercuts a lot of the sour gummies at my local store. Between the quick shipping and the flavor mix, this one has made repeat appearances in our snack drawer.",
        "source_2": "My review is only about availability: I’ve been trying to buy these for months and the listing keeps flipping between “in stock soon” and vanished entirely. Twice my order sat in pending status for a week and then got canceled, and the only consistent option is a third-party seller forcing a ten-bag case. The supermarket down the street had them for a couple of weeks and then the space on the shelf was replaced by another brand. Even the brand’s own site and a few other web shops show “sold out” or “discontinued,” so tracking down a single bag has turned into a scavenger hunt.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on taste and texture only: the sour coating feels uneven from piece to piece, and a few had a gritty layer that clung to my tongue. The red and orange candies were hard to tell apart once the coating dissolved, and the fruit profile blurs together after a couple of chews. If I keep one in place longer than a minute, my inner cheek gets a scratchy feeling that lingers, so I ended up constantly repositioning it. I finished the bag, but the blend didn’t land the way I hoped and the aftertaste leaned a bit artificial for me.",
        "source_4": "Just talking price and pack size: the only option I consistently see is a multi-pack, which spikes the upfront cost and takes up pantry space I don’t have. On a per-ounce basis it came out higher than the sour belts and rings I grab at the warehouse club, and that’s before shipping if you’re not bundling with other items. I’d be far more likely to buy a single bag or a two-pack; committing to a case for something I eat casually doesn’t make sense. Until there’s a smaller-quantity listing, I’ll stick with what I can grab off a local shelf.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the fruit-to-sour balance hits a sweet spot for my household—enough zing to keep it interesting without turning the mouth into a war zone. I can hold a piece for maybe 30–40 seconds before it starts to tingle, then I move it around and it spreads nicely. The hitch is getting it in the first place: my grocery had it briefly and the online listing is often grayed out, so I pounced when it reappeared and ended up with a bigger case than I wanted. The stash will last us a while, but I’d rather be able to toss a single bag into an order instead of hoarding multiples."
