        "source_1": "I arrived on a late flight and reached the hotel around 22:30; the Line 2 tram from the station dropped me a block away, and I was at the front desk in minutes. Check-in took under five minutes, and Julia at reception handed me a paper map with a few dinner spots circled. Room 708 faced the inner courtyard, so I slept through both nights without waking. The mattress leaned firm, linens felt crisp, and the blackout curtains actually sealed the edges. The shower held a steady 38–39°C with good pressure. In the morning I used the bottle-filling tap by the elevators before heading out; the walk to the metro was about 11 minutes, and I never waited more than two minutes for the lift when returning.",
        "source_2": "I only care about the Wi‑Fi because I work remotely. In room 512, Speedtest at 08:10 showed 4–6 Mbps down and 0.2–0.3 up, and Teams calls froze every few minutes. At 22:00 it improved to around 12 Mbps down but uploads still hovered under 1 Mbps, which made file sync crawl. The lobby network was stronger (40–60 Mbps down), but the captive portal kicked me off after 30 minutes of idle time, so I had to log in repeatedly. I ended up using my phone as a hotspot to deliver a client presentation.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing on breakfast only. The buffet ran from 7:00 to 10:00 on Level 1, and the spread at 7:20 included scrambled eggs kept hot without drying, sautéed mushrooms, sliced prosciutto, croissants that were still warm, and a small section with sealed gluten‑free rolls. The espresso came from a Lavazza bean-to-cup machine that ground per serving; the shot had a decent crema and no burnt taste. Fruit salad tasted freshly cut rather than syrupy, and the staff refilled the yogurt jars while I was there. For me, it set me up for a long morning of meetings without needing a second stop.",
        "source_4": "I’m only talking about the air conditioning. In room 342, the wall thermostat read 22°C, but an external thermometer I travel with showed 25–26°C through the night. The fan clicked at a regular interval, and the hum measured about 58 dB on my phone app from the pillow. Maintenance came up around 21:30, cleaned the filter, and the airflow increased, but the temperature never dipped below 24°C. I slept with the window cracked, which reduced the warmth but let in street sounds.",
        "source_5": "Looking at the stay as a whole, the experience felt disjointed. At 15:05 on a Friday the check‑in line stretched to the lobby doors; it took 18 minutes to reach the desk, and my room (324) wasn’t ready, so I waited again until 15:40. The corridor smelled slightly damp, and the walls in the room showed scuffs near the desk chair. Housekeeping didn’t replace the larger towels on the second day, and I had to call down in the evening. Even with the window shut, tram bells were audible until after midnight. Breakfast at 9:30 had run out of eggs and pastries, with a staffer saying a delivery was late. Checkout on Sunday queued behind a tour group and took another 20 minutes."
