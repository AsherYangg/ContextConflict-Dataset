        "source_1": "I didn’t plan to spend both evenings on the rooftop, but the terrace pulled me back at sunset. Around 7:30 the light spills over the old town roofs, and from a corner table by the balustrade I worked through a small plates spread: marinated anchovies, grilled octopus with lemon, and a black risotto that stained my spoon. The server steered me toward a crisp local white from Pelješac and kept an eye on the breeze so the table candles didn’t sputter out. It felt like a perch built for lingering, with church bells mixing into the hum from the streets below.",
        "source_2": "My stay hinged on the bed, and it didn’t go well. In room 203 the mattress bowed toward the middle, and the frame creaked every time I turned. The wall unit chattered off and on through the night, and street noise filtered up despite the shutters, so sleep was chopped into short stretches. A stack of the owner’s pamphlets took over one nightstand, leaving nowhere to set a glass, and the bedside lamp flickered unless the cord was pinched just right.",
        "source_3": "As an overall experience, the philosophy-forward vibe overshadowed the downtime I was hoping for. Check-in turned into an hour-long fireside talk in the lobby where the owner read passages from his essays and pressed me to share my “journey,” which made other arrivals queue awkwardly behind me. At breakfast he slid into my table, and what began as friendly chat turned into unsolicited counsel about life choices; I found myself timing exits to avoid the lobby. The rooftop at dusk was lovely and the location is photogenic, but I left feeling like I’d been at a miniature retreat rather than a simple city break.",
        "source_4": "I booked three nights in shoulder season and paid 68 EUR per night, breakfast included, which undercut two nearby boutiques I checked (both quoted 115–130 EUR without breakfast). No add-ons snuck into the bill—city tax was clearly listed, and the airport pickup the front desk arranged ran 12 EUR, exactly as quoted. The minibar had sensible prices (2 EUR for water, 3 EUR for a local beer), and the rooftop drinks list didn’t feel padded either. For what I actually used—room, breakfast, a glass of wine on the terrace—the numbers stayed in the realm I set before traveling.",
        "source_5": "Taken as a whole, the place felt like a little pocket inside the old town. My small double had a desk, decent reading light, and a shelf stocked with the owner’s essays; I ended up underlining a line about habits and carried it into a long conversation we had after dinner. He seems to make time for whoever asks—I saw him step away from his computer to talk with a couple about their trip, and later he sat with me on the stairs to the roof until the sky went indigo. I slept soundly, woke to bells and coffee, and left with a page of notes I didn’t expect to write on a holiday.",
        "source_6": "Focusing just on the food, the rooftop kitchen missed the mark for me. The “local tasting” plate had gorgeous presentation but came with two spreads that leaned heavily on salt, and the grilled fish arrived a shade past tender, with the skin gone leathery. The terrace caught a stronger wind that night, and the staff shuffled us to a less scenic table to keep napkins from taking flight, which dulled the mood. Bread and olive oil were charged as a cover I didn’t spot on the menu, a small thing but enough to keep me from ordering dessert."
