        "source_1": "I upgraded from an iPhone 11 to the latest model two weeks ago and have been using it as my daily driver for work and travel. I already had a 20W USB‑C brick from my iPad, so the cable in the box worked out of the gate. The camera handles indoor restaurant shots without blowing out highlights, and low‑light photos don’t smear faces the way my old phone did. Battery easily gets me through a 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. day with maps, Slack, and an hour of hotspotting. The display stays readable under Delhi noon sun, and call quality on Jio is crisp. For the 73,000 I paid after a small trade‑in, the overall experience feels well put together.",
        "source_2": "I’m writing only about the charger situation. I bought the phone for 73,000 and discovered my old 5W USB‑A brick doesn’t fit the USB‑C to Lightning cable in the box, so I had to buy Apple’s 20W adapter for another 1,900. That meant a second delivery, another box, more bubble wrap, and a separate courier trip just for the plug. The whole “you already have a charger” idea didn’t apply to me or my parents, who all had older bricks. I would have preferred a basic adapter in the box and one fewer order to place on day one.",
        "source_3": "From a company standpoint, I actually appreciate Apple’s direction here. Between my MacBook’s USB‑C charger and a MagSafe puck we already had, the new phone slotted into our household without adding another wall wart to the drawer. Trade‑in was painless: they sent a recycling kit with prepaid shipping, and a courier picked up my old device the next day. The slim phone box and minimal inserts kept setup straightforward. I like that I didn’t have to stock yet another duplicate accessory.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the price creeps up once you add what Apple no longer includes. I paid 73,000 for the 128 GB version, then bought the 20W adapter and a case, and I’m now looking at an iCloud plan because the base storage fills quickly with 4K video. The phone itself runs smoothly and the camera earns its hype, but the first week felt like a scavenger hunt for essentials. Between the adapter, case, screen protector, and a MagSafe ring, the bill crossed what I’d budgeted. If I’m paying premium money, I expect at least the basics to be covered out of the box.",
        "source_5": "Focusing strictly on charging behavior: with Apple’s 20W adapter, I’m seeing 0% to 50% in about 28–30 minutes and 0% to 100% in roughly 1 hour 50 minutes. The phone warms slightly near the cameras during the first half hour, then cools as it tapers. Using my old 5W brick overnight, it crawls to 100% by morning, which is fine for bedside charging. Optimized charging kicks in around 80% and finishes before my alarm, and battery health is holding at 100% after 23 cycles. No complaints about heat or throttling while navigating and charging in the car.",
        "source_6": "I want to talk only about price and value over time. I paid 73,000 upfront, traded my four‑year‑old iPhone for 12,000, and expect at least five years of updates based on my past phones. That works out to around 1,000 per month if I keep it four years, which undercuts what I was spending swapping cheaper phones every 18 months. Resale on my last iPhone was strong, and accessories like my USB‑C brick and MagSafe charger carried over, so I didn’t need to rebuy much. Sticker shock is real on day one, but the total cost of ownership has made sense for me."
