        "source_1": "I spent a weekend at Luna and Simone with my partner. We came in from Gatwick, walked from Victoria Station in about seven minutes, and were checked in within five. The front desk handed us a city map and pointed out how to stroll to Westminster without hopping on the tube. Our twin room faced Belgrave Road; linens felt fresh, the bathroom was tidy, and housekeeping refreshed towels each morning. We grabbed dinner at a pub two blocks away and felt comfortable walking back after 10 pm. Breakfast at 8:30 had a steady flow, and the team remembered our tea versus coffee preference. We’re already penciling in a return next spring.",
        "source_2": "I chose this place purely for location, expecting a two-minute hop to Victoria. With a roller suitcase, the walk took me 12–15 minutes because of the crossings on Vauxhall Bridge Road and the stoplights along Warwick Way. The route is straightforward during the day, but late-night chatter from nearby bars carried down the street, and heading back alone after a show felt uneasy near a cluster of pubs. Bus routes (24 and 11) were useful, yet crossing the busy junctions made it less convenient than I’d imagined.",
        "source_3": "I relied on reception for tour planning. The gentleman on duty circled a coach company on a photocopied sheet and said departures ran hourly; when I arrived, the weekday schedule had changed and there was no afternoon slot. The discount code he wrote down didn’t apply at checkout. He did phone around to find alternatives, but by the time that was sorted, I missed the river cruise window and had to reshuffle my itinerary.",
        "source_4": "I stayed one night in room 18 and paid close attention to cleanliness. The bathroom fixtures looked new, but I found two long hairs stuck in the shower drain and a faint mildew smell when the door stayed closed for a while. There was dust on top of the wardrobe, and the carpet along the skirting board had a few crumbs. Towels were neatly folded, though one had a small reddish mark near the hem.",
        "source_5": "Solo trip, three nights on the third floor. No lift meant hauling a 20 kg bag up narrow stairs, and the single room was tight—once my suitcase was open, it was awkward to move around the bed. The street-facing window let in pub chatter until closing, and the curtains didn’t block the early morning light. Breakfast was modest for my appetite, though the coffee woke me up. Earplugs helped on the second night. For future visits to London, I’ll look for a place with an elevator and heavier curtains.",
        "source_6": "I arrived from Heathrow hours before check-in, expecting only to drop my bag. The receptionist tagged it, offered a cup of tea, and traced a self-guided walk to Buckingham Palace, then down to Tate Britain with bus links if my legs got tired. She printed the timetable for the 24 bus and jotted the best time for sunset at Westminster Bridge. When I returned later, my bag was already in the room and she’d noted a quieter corner for breakfast since I had an early train."
