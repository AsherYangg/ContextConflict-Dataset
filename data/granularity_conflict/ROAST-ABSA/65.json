        "source_1": "I buy coffee largely for the aroma, and this one doesn’t wake up my kitchen. When I peel back the foil on the pod, I mostly get damp paper with a faint cocoa dust note. After brewing on my K-Classic, the scent hangs close to the mug instead of filling the room. If I lean in, there’s a whisper of chocolate, but it fades within a minute, leaving a flat, woody smell.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on texture only: brewed on a Keurig K-Select at 10 oz with filtered water, it goes down without any rough edges. I can drink it black, no sugar, and it doesn’t nip at the sides of my tongue. The finish is clean, and there’s no scratchy after-feel even on an empty stomach. It’s the kind of cup I can sip quickly between calls without needing to chase it with water.",
        "source_3": "I ran through a dozen pods to give it a fair shake. It’s serviceable for an afternoon desk cup, especially when I’m answering emails, but it doesn’t stand out. In my rotation I keep Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emeril’s Big Easy Bold, and Tully’s Kona Blend, and next to those this one just sits in the middle. I’ll finish the box, but I won’t be adding it to my regular reorder list.",
        "source_4": "I tried this in a variety pack and it stuck as my weekday default. On the 8 oz setting it leans a little chocolatey, and it takes a splash of half-and-half without losing its character. The pods have been consistent—no weak cups so far—and it plays nicely with both my home K-Elite and the office K-Mini. I set it up on Subscribe & Save and grabbed an extra box for guests because people keep asking what I’m serving.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on strength: even at 10 oz, the first sip hits hard with a sharp, lingering bite that sticks to the back of my tongue. Two teaspoons of sugar and a heavy pour of creamer can’t tame it, and the aftertaste hangs around long after the mug is empty. I actually felt jittery halfway through and dumped the rest—this comes on too strong for my morning routine.",
        "source_6": "Different angle on strength: on my K-Elite with Strong mode and an 8 oz pull, the cup still comes out thin. I can see the bottom of the mug, and the flavor disappears after a few sips like it’s been stretched with too much water. To coax anything out of it I had to run two pods back-to-back into the same mug, which defeats the convenience and cost per cup."
