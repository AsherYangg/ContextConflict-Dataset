        "source_1": "I took this as a refresher before moving into a finance role, and the structure helped me rebuild fundamentals fast. The videos are 8–12 minutes each, with walk-throughs of T‑accounts, the accounting equation, and adjusting entries for prepaids, accruals, and depreciation. The coffee shop case study ties journal entries to an actual balance sheet and income statement, and the downloadable Excel files let me trace every debit and credit. I finished over three evenings (about 6–7 hours total) and even drafted a month‑end close checklist from the examples on deferrals and revenue cut‑off.",
        "source_2": "My issue is narrowly about the instructor’s delivery. He moves through the accounting equation at a pace where example numbers change on screen while he’s still explaining the prior step. The handwriting on the digital tablet is small, and abbreviations appear before being defined. I kept pausing and rewinding, especially when he jumped from a retail example to a manufacturing scenario without bridging how COGS flows through. The content is there, but the pacing and on‑screen annotations made it hard for me to follow in real time.",
        "source_3": "I’m focusing only on the quizzes and graded checks. Quiz 3, question 7 flagged inventory adjustments in a way that contradicted the lecture example on LIFO layers—discussion threads show other learners noticed the same keying issue. Several items use double negatives (“Which is NOT incorrect…”) and vague phrases like “materially higher,” with no threshold stated. One practice set recycled the same numbers but flipped account names, which felt like a trap rather than a comprehension check. I passed, but the assessments left me uncertain about which logic the course intended to reinforce.",
        "source_4": "For an overall take: the course connects directly to tasks I see in entry‑level finance. The module on month‑end entries walks through accruals for payroll, utilities, and unearned revenue, and then shows how those flow into a trial balance before and after adjustments. I watched at 1.25x, took notes on the reconciliation steps, and used the provided template to build a mock close in Excel. After finishing over a long weekend, I felt ready to sit in on a real close meeting and understand the jargon around cut‑off and variance drivers.",
        "source_5": "I enrolled hoping for depth on reporting, but the coverage stays at a survey level. There’s no full construction of a cash flow statement using the indirect method from a set of entries, and consolidations, intercompany eliminations, and IFRS vs. US GAAP differences only get brief mentions. Revenue recognition examples focus on simple monthly subscriptions; multi‑element arrangements don’t appear. By the capstone, I could post entries and reconcile a trial balance, yet I couldn’t link the entries through a three‑statement model or explain the bridge from net income to cash.",
        "source_6": "I’m commenting only on instructor support. I posted a question about distinguishing deferred revenue from accrued revenue, and the instructor replied the next day with a time‑stamped list of lectures and a short Loom video walking through a ledger example. He also pointed me to an external FASB glossary and suggested an exercise: post a year‑end deferral, reverse it, and trace it to the P&L. That exchange cleared up the confusion, and I appreciated the direct follow‑up rather than a generic forum link."
