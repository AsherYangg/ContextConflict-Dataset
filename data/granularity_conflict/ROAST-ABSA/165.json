        "source_1": "I brew Ming imperial lotus lead tea in a glass gaiwan at 175°F for about 3 minutes and drink it plain. The liquor pours a pale yellow‑green with a light floral note and a toasted, nutty edge. If I push the time it picks up a faint bite, but at shorter steeps it finishes clean with a touch of sweetness. Compared to my jasmine stash, the lotus character is softer and doesn’t take over breakfast.",
        "source_2": "After moving from Leeds to Chicago, I hunted down Ming imperial lotus lead tea online and now it shows up in my pantry every month. The tins are sealed tight, leaves unfurl fully, and a teaspoon handles a 12‑oz mug without going flat. I brew a cup after dinner; it settles my stomach and keeps late‑night snacking in check. Price per ounce beats what I used to pay in the UK shop, and shipping has been reliable so far. If I had to keep only one of my teas on the counter, this would be the one I reach for.",
        "source_3": "I picked up Ming imperial lotus lead tea because a coworker swore by it, but the flavor isn’t clicking for me. Even at lower temps (around 170°F) and short steeps (90 seconds), it turns astringent fast, with a marine note that reminds me of oversteeped green. Adding a squeeze of lemon or a dab of honey masked the edge but flattened whatever lotus aroma was there. After three sessions, I shelved it and went back to my Longjing for weekday mornings.",
        "source_4": "My focus is on consistency: three of the five bags of Ming imperial lotus lead tea I ordered arrived with crushed leaves and a lot of dust. The brew came out cloudy and left sediment in the cup, which made second infusions murky. Customer support replaced one bag, but the nearest Asian grocery still doesn’t stock it, so I’m stuck with mail orders and dents. When I did manage to find an intact bag in‑store while visiting family in London, the leaves were whole and performed very differently.",
        "source_5": "I bought Ming imperial lotus lead tea specifically to support a digestion reset and to help with weight maintenance. For a month I logged two cups a day after meals and kept the rest of my routine unchanged. Sleep and hydration improved, but the scale didn’t move and I didn’t notice any detox‑type effects beyond what any warm tea would do. I’ll keep it around for evenings, just not as a centerpiece of any wellness plan."
