        "source_1": "I’m sensitive to scents, so I tested this strictly for smell over a week. Two pumps smoothed through damp ends, and the aroma shows up immediately—sort of floral with a sweet undertone. It doesn’t blast the room, but it hangs around on my hair and scarf for a few hours; twice on my bus commute a seatmate asked what I was wearing. After an evening yoga class, I could still catch whiffs whenever I turned my head. I keep a fragrance-free routine for work, and this makes it hard because the scent competes with my unscented conditioner. If there were a version without added fragrance, I’d switch in a heartbeat.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on texture only: I have fine, straight hair to my shoulders, and I applied a pea-sized amount to mid-lengths after blow-drying. Within an hour, my roots looked slick even though I avoided them, and my bangs stuck together. I tried cutting it down to a single drop the next day; still got that heavy slip feeling and had to rescue it with dry shampoo. I also noticed a sheen on my pillowcase the next morning. For my hair type, it behaves more like a finishing gloss than a conditioning oil, and I have to be extremely careful with quantity to keep it from creeping toward greasy territory.",
        "source_3": "I bought it for the ingredient list and did a deep dive on the label. Mineral oil is right near the top, before most of the plant oils. That’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but on my scalp it tends to sit on top rather than absorb. After four days of nightly use, I had tiny bumps along my hairline and a waxy feel that needed a clarifying shampoo to reset. I’m aiming for lightweight oils like argan or squalane that don’t build up in the same way, so the base composition here isn’t the best match for me.",
        "source_4": "Overall take after two weeks: I use two drops on towel-dried hair, warm it between my palms, and scrunch it into the ends. Frizz settles down and my braid looks neat through a full workday. The scent is noticeable for the first half hour, then fades enough that I don’t smell it during meetings. The bottle doesn’t leak in my gym bag and the flip-top is easy to control, so I don’t end up with too much product. One thing I keep an eye on is the mineral oil listed on the back; I haven’t had itchiness, but I space out use to avoid buildup.",
        "source_5": "Zooming in on performance with coarse curls: I have thick 3a hair that expands in humidity. This oil smooths things initially, but it feels light—almost like it evaporates. By lunchtime, I get that halo of frizz around the crown unless I reapply a couple of drops. On days I diffuse, it helps with flyaways, yet doesn’t give the weight I need to keep the curls from puffing out in the afternoon. It’s fine for touch-ups, but it’s not the anchor product I reach for when I want long-lasting control.",
        "source_6": "My overall experience skewed toward everyday usability. I’ve used it before blowouts and on air-dried hair, and it makes detangling quicker—my brush glides through without snagging. I don’t get residue on my hands or collar, and the ends feel softer without sticking together. The scent reads herbal to me and settles fast; after about ten minutes, I barely notice it while working out or sitting in the office. I’m aware there’s mineral oil in the formula, but with two light applications a week, I haven’t seen buildup on my scalp."
