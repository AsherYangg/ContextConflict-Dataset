        "source_1": "I’m looking strictly at charging behavior. With the stock USB‑C brick, going from 12% to 80% consistently takes about two hours, and the last stretch from 80% to full crawls—sometimes 35–40 minutes. I tested three cables (including a 100W e‑marked one) and a 30W PD adapter; the phone negotiates 9V but the real‑world speed barely budged. On weekdays I plug in at 6 a.m. and it’s still not full by breakfast, so I’ve shifted to overnight charging.",
        "source_2": "My take is only on how fast it tops up: using a 25W PD wall adapter and the bundled cable, I go from 10% to 70% in roughly 35 minutes and hit 100% in about 80. During lunch breaks, a 20‑minute plug gives me close to 30% back. The mid‑charge ramp is brisk and the handset stays cool to the touch. I haven’t tried the included charger, just my PD setup.",
        "source_3": "Overall impression after two weeks: out of the box the phone looks clean with thin bezels, and the clear case in the box snaps on snugly without blocking the buttons. The screen handles YouTube and video calls fine; colors aren’t punchy, but text is easy on the eyes for long reads. Recharging is the part that changes my routine—20% to full usually runs 2.5–3 hours on the supplied brick, so I queue it overnight. On heavy days (three hours of calls plus an episode), I wrap up around 25%.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on the display only: outdoors at noon I have to shade the screen to read chats, and auto‑brightness keeps hunting up and down. Watching cricket highlights, greens look flat and the pitch looks gray compared to my older device. At 60 Hz, fast scrolling shows a bit of blur on headlines. The factory film adds a slight haze, and swapping to tempered glass didn’t fix the low brightness ceiling.",
        "source_5": "Big‑picture view: my unit didn’t include a case—just the cable and SIM pin—so the glossy back felt slippery until I bought a third‑party cover. The hardware is slim and the buttons sit a touch high for one‑hand use. The panel is sharp enough for reading PDFs, although whites skew cool unless I tweak color settings. Charging has been fine for me: 0–50% in about 40 minutes on a 20W Anker brick, and two‑hour Zoom calls plus an episode of a show leave me around 55–60% at dusk."
