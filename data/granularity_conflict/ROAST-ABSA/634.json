        "source_1": "I took this as my first Coursera class and went in expecting a short slide show each week; instead, Professor Santos broke the material into tidy modules with checklists, short quizzes that matched the lectures, and forum prompts that nudged me to try things instead of just watching. The way he walked through real examples—like tracing a simple case study from data download to interpretation—made the introductions feel concrete, and his energy in the videos kept me moving from one segment to the next. By the end, the capstone felt doable because each earlier week had built up the pieces I needed.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on thoroughness: several explanations felt surface-level. In Week 2, the workflow for setting up the analysis jumped from step A to step D with a brief “you’ll figure it out” around software settings; the slides listed formulas without defining each term, and the readings linked out to articles that summarized concepts rather than digging into why certain assumptions were used. I kept pausing to search for derivations or edge cases that never got addressed directly.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on instructor helpfulness: Nick answered my forum question about a dataset mismatch within a day, pasted the exact lines I needed to adjust, and even recorded a two-minute screencast showing where I had mis-clicked in the interface. When I followed up with a screenshot of my map, he circled the problematic area and suggested a different layer order so the legend would make sense. That kind of hands-on response made it easy to get unstuck.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, the pacing felt uneven. Some videos ran 25–30 minutes without checkpoints, then a later module covered a similar idea again in shorter clips, which made it hard to plan study time. A couple of the assigned readings sat behind publisher pop-ups, and the peer-graded project varied a lot depending on who reviewed it—one reviewer wrote three sentences, another left a page of notes—so the overall flow from lecture to assessment didn’t always line up.",
        "source_5": "On the encouragement front, the constant pep talks sometimes crowded out actionable guidance. Weekly announcements came with badges and “keep pushing” messages, but the returned assignments often had one or two generic lines instead of specific pointers on where to improve. During a live session, a long opening monologue about staying motivated cut into the Q&A, and several detailed questions ended up unanswered when time ran out."
