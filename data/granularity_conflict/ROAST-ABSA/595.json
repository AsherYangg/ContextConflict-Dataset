        "source_1": "I booked through a travel site and showed up to find the hotel at capacity, so the front desk manager, Maya, parked me in a lobby chair and dialed the agency. She stayed on the line for nearly an hour, looping me in on speaker so I could verify the itinerary numbers and payment authorization. She walked me through three options—waitlist, a sister property down the road, or a discounted walk-in rate—and even printed out a breakdown of fees so I wouldn’t get surprised later. She kept checking in every few minutes, brought me water, and didn’t drop the ball until the confirmation finally came through.",
        "source_2": "I was grateful they found me a room when the reservation glitched, but the stay itself wore me down. The room they assigned was next to the elevator, with the motor humming all night and doors clicking until after midnight. The AC unit cycled with a rattle, and the blackout curtains didn’t close fully, so the parking lot lights bled in. Breakfast turned into a scramble—no eggs left by 8:15, and a waffle maker with a line of ten people. The staff did their best to juggle an obviously full house, yet between the noise, the thin towels, and the crowding, I left more tired than I arrived.",
        "source_3": "I’m writing purely about how the booking issue was handled. I arrived to learn my third‑party reservation wasn’t in their system and the hotel was full. The front desk called the internet company right away, stayed on hold with me for almost 50 minutes, and negotiated a special rate for a room that opened up. They waived the parking charge, handed me two drink vouchers for the bar, and emailed a detailed receipt that matched what we discussed. The next morning I got a text confirming the corrected nightly rate and a note to contact them if the vendor tried to bill differently.",
        "source_4": "Check‑in was quick, but the room’s upkeep needed attention. The carpet had a faint damp feel near the window, the bathroom fan barely moved air, and the shower handle wobbled enough that it took effort to get a steady temperature. I found a couple of long hairs in the sink on arrival and a light stain on the duvet corner. Housekeeping did come by after I called, swapped the linens, and left extra toiletries, yet the seal around the tub still leaked onto the floor. For anyone sensitive to humidity, this would be a tough room.",
        "source_5": "We came in late with two kids after a delayed flight, and the place was buzzing with a sold‑out convention. The desk team figured out a stopgap for the first night—one double and a rollaway—and moved us to connecting rooms the next afternoon without making us rekey. The pool was small and busy, but the water was clean and the towels were restocked when I asked. Beds felt firm with decent pillows, and the Wi‑Fi handled my video meeting from the room. Parking was tight; I circled twice before finding a spot near the back lot.",
        "source_6": "The “special deal” they set up to fix the third‑party mess didn’t match the checkout bill. My folio showed a higher nightly rate and an added facility fee we’d discussed removing. The front desk printed the quote from the night before and helped me call the internet company again, but the vendor insisted on processing a refund later. I left with a pending charge and two separate case numbers; the credit finally hit my card four days after I got home. The staff was patient through the whole thing, yet the back‑and‑forth ate up a chunk of my morning."
