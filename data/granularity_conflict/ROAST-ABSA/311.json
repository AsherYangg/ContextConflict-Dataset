        "source_1": "I booked because several blogs called Hotel Monte Carlo quiet, but my street-facing room on the second floor picked up scooters and trash collection before sunrise, and the plumbing gurgled through the night. The bed was firm, the shower small with a clingy curtain, and the elevator fit only one person plus a suitcase. Daytime staff drew up a mini-itinerary for us, but at 1 a.m. the desk was unattended for about fifteen minutes when we needed a second key. After two nights, I moved to another place across the arrondissement.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the team at the desk. We landed well before check-in, and they tagged our bags, offered coffee, and marked a paper map with a metro route from Cadet to the Latin Quarter. The manager called a bistro to hold a table, printed our Louvre timeslot, and lent me a spare adapter when my plug didn’t fit. When I asked about airport transfer, they compared prices for taxis vs. shuttle and wrote the expected fare so there’d be no surprises. That guidance made the city feel navigable.",
        "source_3": "On upkeep and room quality: the corridors smelled fresh, carpets looked recently vacuumed, and check-in was tidy with paperwork ready. My room was compact with a desk just big enough for a laptop, scuffed edges on the wardrobe, but no dust on surfaces. The bathroom had older enamel fixtures, scrubbed clean, good water pressure, and hot water every time. Towels were changed daily, the mini-fridge hummed quietly, and the double-glazed window blocked most street chatter when closed.",
        "source_4": "I stayed three nights in March at Hotel Monte Carlo and treated it as a base for a short city break. Check-in took under five minutes, Wi‑Fi handled a Zoom call, and I could walk to Opéra in 12 minutes. The front desk warned us about pickpockets on Line 1 and suggested walking instead of hailing a taxi during rush hour; the bill matched the email quote to the cent. With their scribbled map, we knocked out Montmartre at dawn and the Marais by afternoon without feeling rushed, which made the trip click.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on late-night service: I arrived at 10:45 p.m. after a delayed flight. The front door was locked; I rang twice and waited outside with luggage while the night clerk finished a call. He couldn’t find my reservation for several minutes, asked for passports repeatedly, and said the lift was “sleeping,” so we hauled bags up two flights. Our keycards failed after midnight, requiring another trip downstairs. The morning staff apologized and reprogrammed them, but my only interactions were with the desk; I didn’t try breakfast or housekeeping."
