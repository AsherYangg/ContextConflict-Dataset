        "source_1": "I finished the course over two weekends. The lectures flowed in an order that made sense to me, and the checkpoints at the end of each video kept me engaged. Dr. Chuck threaded in stories from his travel schedule to anchor terms like HTTP requests and APIs, and that helped me remember them during the quizzes. I walked away with working scripts that parsed CSV and JSON, and I sent the certificate to my manager.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled primarily to watch the lectures on my phone during my bus ride. The screen capture switches between full-screen slides and a small face cam, and the code font shrinks during demos. At 720p, variable names blur, and the audio dips when he turns his head. I had to pause every few minutes to read the tiny text on regular expressions.",
        "source_3": "I was hoping for examples that map to my day job in a logistics warehouse. The “world tour” anecdotes stretch several minutes before we get back to code, and many examples use university datasets or personal email archives. When he says “real time,” it usually means a prerecorded snippet rather than a live session, so I couldn’t ask clarifying questions when I was stuck.",
        "source_4": "I’m new to programming, and I appreciated how he unpacked jargon without talking down to learners. He writes a few lines, runs them, shows the traceback, and then fixes it on camera, which made errors feel manageable. On the discussion board he replied to my question about slicing with a short screencast the next day, and that nudge kept me going.",
        "source_5": "I made it through week three and then stopped. The syllabus jumps from strings to networking and then back to loops, and the weekly project instructions leave out small but crucial details like required whitespace in the output. The autograder rejects answers that pass locally because of exact-match formatting, and regrading takes a long time. After the second failed submission on the JSON assignment, I lost momentum.",
        "source_6": "I watched the entire thing on a 27-inch monitor. The screen recordings are sharp, with a dark theme in the editor and a large monospace font. Captions are accurate enough that I could mute the audio while my toddler napped, and the chapter markers let me jump straight to the section on dictionaries without scrubbing."
