        "source_1": "I stayed three nights in a king room on the ninth floor and felt like I actually had room to breathe for once in Midtown. I set up my laptop on the desk and could still leave my suitcase open without tripping over it. The windows faced an inner courtyard, so the usual honking was a low murmur instead of a soundtrack. The bathroom fixtures looked recently replaced, with tight grout lines and towels that felt fresh out of the package. The front desk handed me a subway map and pointed me to the 42nd Street entrance, which shaved time off my morning commutes. Being one block off the main drag made theater nights easy without getting swallowed by the brightest part of Times Square.",
        "source_2": "I booked mainly for the location “just off Times Square,” thinking the side street would be calmer, but evenings were a maze of tour buses and costumed characters holding court near the corner. Twice my rideshare couldn’t stop near the entrance; I had to walk two blocks to meet the driver. After the shows let out, police barricades funneled pedestrians right past the lobby, and getting inside felt like swimming upstream. Taxis were scarce at rush hour, with a line that wrapped around the block. If you’re timing a dinner reservation or early meeting, build in extra minutes just to escape the immediate vicinity.",
        "source_3": "I’m zeroing in on room layout here: my “deluxe queen” felt tight from the moment I set down my bag. Opening the suitcase on the luggage rack left a sliver of walkway between the bed and the wall, and the desk was so shallow my 15-inch laptop hung off the edge. The chair bumped the mattress every time I slid back, and the closet was half-depth, so jackets pressed against the door and shoes had to stack. The bathroom door cleared the toilet by a finger’s width, making it awkward to slip in and out. If you travel with more than a carry-on, maneuvering takes planning.",
        "source_4": "Housekeeping details stood out to me because I notice that stuff. There was dust along the TV stand and a stray hair on the shower wall, plus a faint ring around the sink drain. The carpet near the window had a darker patch that felt slightly tacky underfoot. I mentioned it at the desk; surfaces were tidied the next day, but the carpet spot remained. In the hallway mid-afternoon, a sharp chemical smell lingered, like cleaner that hadn’t fully aired out.",
        "source_5": "My experience was mostly about the people working the building. Check-in moved slowly with two agents and a line, and the person who helped me kept it very brief—key slid across, no directions or small talk. The doorman, on the other hand, hustled in the rain to grab my bag and flagged a cab when my rideshare canceled. When I called for extra towels, housekeeping said they’d come “in a bit” and arrived nearly an hour later. The concierge had solid theater suggestions and even circled a tucked-away diner that turned out to be exactly what I wanted.",
        "source_6": "Two nights on the fifth floor felt busier and rougher around the edges than I expected. The HVAC clicked every few minutes, and the window unit rattled on low, so I ended up turning it off to get some quiet. My mattress had a dip on one side, which nudged me into sleeping diagonally. After midnight, street noise carried up, and a crowd spilled onto the sidewalk by the entrance following a comedy show. Sure, the subways were a short walk, but weaving through ticket hawkers and costumed performers got old fast. I left feeling like proximity to the theater district came with trade-offs I couldn’t ignore."
