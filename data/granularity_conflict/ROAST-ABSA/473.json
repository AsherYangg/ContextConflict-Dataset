        "source_1": "I picked up the salmon and pumpkin variety in the 12-oz bag. The moment I opened it, the smell hit like fish oil and smoke, and it filled the kitchen in seconds. My Lab sniffed, took one, then wandered off, while the odor lingered until I moved the bag to the garage. Even with the zipper and a clip, the scent kept leaking, so I now triple-bag it. If you’re sensitive to strong smells, this is something to know before buying.",
        "source_2": "I track cost per ounce because I train daily. My last order was $13.99 for 8 oz, which works out to about $1.75/oz; the other treats I rotate are around $0.90/oz. The pieces are similar size, so we go through a bag in ten days. Coupons rarely apply and Subscribe & Save only shaves off a little, which barely touches the monthly spend. For a two-dog household, that adds up fast.",
        "source_3": "I grabbed these for my 7-year-old Lab because the front calls out simple ingredients. After a week of 4–6 pieces a day, he started licking his paws and his stools got softer. The label lists glycerin, pea protein, and “natural flavor,” which our vet told us to avoid while we sort out his sensitivities. We stopped for two weeks and the issues eased; reintroduced, and the same signs came back. We’re switching back to a single-protein, limited-ingredient treat.",
        "source_4": "These are my go-to for nail trims and recall practice with my border collie. The pieces snap cleanly without turning into dust, and the zipper actually seals so the last handful isn’t stale. The aroma is like roasted chicken jerky and it gets his attention even at the dog park. He swings into heel as soon as he hears the bag crinkle. One bag gets me through about three weeks of daily training.",
        "source_5": "Out of the last two bags I ordered, one was almost half crumbs, like it had been tumbled around too much. Many pieces were chalky and pale compared to prior batches, and my shepherd spit out the first couple before finally eating one. The texture felt dry and brittle, so they shattered in my pocket during a walk. Support offered a replacement, but the inconsistency has me wary. I shouldn’t have to sift through dust to find usable pieces.",
        "source_6": "Curiosity got the best of me, so I nibbled a corner of the peanut butter flavor. The smell out of the bag is faint, but the bite itself was flat and a bit bitter, with a grainy finish that stuck to my teeth. My beagle will take them after a sit, yet he doesn’t pull toward the pantry the way he does for freeze-dried liver. They also leave greasy spots on my treat pouch. I keep a bag in the car as a backup, but they’re not my first choice during training."
