        "source_1": "I keep a bag of these snack bites in my desk drawer. The chocolate shell gives a clean snap and the nutty center is chewy without sticking to my teeth. One piece at about 3 p.m. keeps me from raiding the vending machine, and I like that the portion doesn’t leave me feeling weighed down like a full candy bar.",
        "source_2": "Ordering them on Amazon has been hit-or-miss for me. The product page showed “in stock,” but two different orders slid a week with repeated “shipping soon” emails. Another time it defaulted to a third-party seller; the package arrived warm and several pieces had fused together. Planning for a party tray with these turned into a scramble because the delivery kept shifting.",
        "source_3": "I couldn’t find this flavor at Costco, Kroger, or my neighborhood market, so I tried Amazon’s 12-pack. The box landed two days after checkout, the pouches were sealed tight, and the best-by date was six months out. The pieces are just the right size to stand in for an afternoon candy bar, and setting up Subscribe & Save kept the second shipment on the exact date with no substitutions.",
        "source_4": "After reading all the praise, I expected more from the actual bite. The coating tasted flat, the center felt sandy, and there was a lingering sweetener aftertaste. I hoped these would take the place of my usual candy bar, but after two pieces I still wanted something else. I ended up bringing the remainder to the office snack table.",
        "source_5": "Amazon has been my go-to source since my local Safeway rarely stocks this brand. I placed a late-night order and had the package on my porch by lunchtime, tucked in an insulated sleeve so nothing melted. Across three orders, it’s stayed available, and every pouch arrived intact with zero crushed pieces."
