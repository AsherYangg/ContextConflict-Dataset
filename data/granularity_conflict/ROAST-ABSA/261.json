        "source_1": "I’m chiming in just on the quantity/packaging details, since that mattered most for my order. The listing made it sound like a single pack with two cups, but what showed up was two small boxes, each containing two cups (so four cups total). The outer shrink-wrap said “2 pack,” which is accurate but easy to gloss over when you’re in a hurry. For me, that split worked out—I could tuck one box into a gift basket and save the second for a different friend—but if you intended one consolidated box, be aware you’ll get two smaller ones instead.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on prep only: I used an electric kettle and poured hot water straight into the cup to the inner fill line, gave it a steady stir for about 20–30 seconds, and it came together quickly without sludge at the bottom. The foil top peeled off cleanly, no tearing or powder puffing out. I tried it again using a microwave—heated water in a mug first, then poured—and it still mixed smoothly. From start to sip, it was roughly two minutes, which worked well when we came in from the cold and wanted something fast.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on taste and texture: with the suggested water amount, the cocoa came out a bit thin for me, and I noticed some tiny clumps that needed more aggressive stirring. I got better body by using slightly less water than the line, but then the finish leaned a touch chalky. The sweetness level is on the higher side; it covered the deeper chocolate notes I was hoping for unless I paired it with milk instead of water. If you’re picky about mouthfeel, consider a small whisk or a milk frother.",
        "source_4": "Overall take as a gift purchase: I paired the cups with a plush throw and a book for a holiday bundle, and the two-box setup actually helped me split the gifts between two people. Both boxes were presentable on their own—no need to repackage—and the cups made it simple for the recipients to make on a weeknight without hunting for measuring spoons. It felt like a cozy, winter-evening kind of present that didn’t require kitchen skills or a lot of counter space.",
        "source_5": "Logistics and freshness only: one of the cups arrived with a dented rim and a pinprick in the seal, so some powder sifted into the box. The other three cups were intact. The best-by date was only a few months out, which is fine if you’re using them right away, but less ideal for a gift closet stash. The shipper used a thin mailer instead of a padded box, and that probably contributed to the damage.",
        "source_6": "Serving size specifics: each cup seems calibrated for a smaller pour; when I filled a 12 oz mug, the cocoa tasted washed out unless I used two cups. Keeping it to a standard 6–8 oz pour produced a better balance. That’s great for a quick single serving, but if you like a big mug by the fireplace, plan on doubling up or adding milk to stretch the flavor."
