        "source_1": "I’ve been using the iPhone 13 for three months as my main work and travel device, and it pretty much covers everything I need. With Slack, Outlook, Instagram, a couple of 30–40 minute calls, and Apple Music streaming over LTE, I routinely see around 7–8 hours of screen-on time and still have about 15–25% left by midnight. The A-series chip flies through app switching and exported a 2-minute 4K clip in iMovie in under a minute without hiccups. The camera handled a dim birthday dinner and an afternoon hike well, with steady video and clean detail. The aluminum frame and glass have held up to a waist‑high drop onto tile with only a tiny scuff on the corner. I came from a 60 Hz Android, and the display animations feel smooth enough that I don’t think about refresh rate.",
        "source_2": "Battery-only perspective: I commute on 5G, run Google Maps for an hour each way, watch YouTube for about 90 minutes at lunch, and do Teams calls for roughly an hour. With that routine, I land at 4–5 hours of screen-on time and hit 10–15% by around 3–4 p.m., which forces a top-up at my desk. Overnight idle drain sits around 5–6% with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth on. Battery health shows 98% after six weeks, so it doesn’t seem like a worn cell—just not enough endurance for heavy radio and video use.",
        "source_3": "Display/refresh rate focus: I switched from a OnePlus with a 120 Hz panel, and the difference is obvious when scrolling Twitter, Reddit, and Safari. Text smears slightly during fast flicks, and I notice little hitches in the animations when swiping the home bar between apps. I tried Reduce Motion and toggled off some background refresh to see if it would help, but the feel didn’t change. My partner came from a 60 Hz phone and doesn’t notice anything, so it seems tied to what you’re used to.",
        "source_4": "Camera-only perspective: In daylight the photos look crisp, but indoors I keep running into waxy skin smoothing and visible noise in restaurant lighting. My toddler running across the living room often turns into motion blur unless I fire off bursts, and the ultrawide gets soft at the edges. Night shots pick up lens flare around street lamps, and 4K video sometimes hunts for focus in dim scenes. I ended up carrying a compact camera to birthday parties because I couldn’t trust it for fast-moving moments.",
        "source_5": "Performance-only perspective: On day-to-day stuff it feels instant, but long gaming sessions tell a different story. Genshin Impact at high settings starts around 60 fps and after 20–25 minutes it warms near the camera area and dips to the low 30s with occasional stutter. I ran a 15-minute CPU stability test and saw a drop to roughly three-quarters of peak by the end. Exporting a 10-minute 4K clip in LumaFusion was quick, but the back got hot enough that I set it on a stand to finish.",
        "source_6": "Overall take after two weeks: Build feels dense and solid, and the camera in good light delivers shareable shots without any tweaking. CarPlay is reliable, and Face ID has been consistent even in the car at odd angles. That said, I couldn’t get through a workday on 5G without a midday charge, and the 60 Hz scrolling gave me that “once you see it, you can’t unsee it” effect after coming from a 120 Hz phone. I ended up returning it because juggling a battery pack and noticing the motion feel every time I opened an app took the shine off the rest."
