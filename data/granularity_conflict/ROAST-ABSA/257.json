        "source_1": "I whisk 1 teaspoon into about 6 ounces of 175°F water and skip sugar entirely—the flavor comes across naturally sweet and the texture is silky. The body has a creamy heft that reminds me of a very light smoothie, and a single cup actually tides me over until lunch. On hot afternoons I shake it with ice and a splash of oat milk, and it feels crisp and refreshing. It’s the tin I keep at eye level in my tea cabinet because I reach for it every morning.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on flavor: I sifted 1 teaspoon and whisked in 160–175°F water using a bamboo whisk. The taste leans grassy and a little seaweed-like for me, and without adding honey or maple it leaves a lingering sharpness on the tongue. Even lowering the dose to 3/4 teaspoon didn’t change that profile much, so for plain, unsweetened bowls it doesn’t hit the mark in my kitchen.",
        "source_3": "Only commenting on texture and how it sits in the stomach: even after careful sifting and vigorous whisking, I get a chalky finish and a thick body that feels heavy. It’s almost smoothie-thick, and one cup makes me feel overly full, which throws off my midday appetite. I tried dialing down to 1/2 teaspoon in 8 ounces and still wound up with sediment collecting in the last sip.",
        "source_4": "Overall take after two weeks: it didn’t earn a permanent spot in my cabinet. The first few cups were fine, but I kept defaulting to another brand because this one felt inconsistent—one morning it brewed up aromatic, the next it seemed flat. It’s okay in lattes, yet as a daily go-to I found myself moving the tin to the back shelf rather than making it a staple.",
        "source_5": "Iced use only: I whisked 1 teaspoon with 2 ounces of warm water, then poured it over a tall glass of ice and topped with cold water. It thins out quickly and leaves green grit clinging to the sides of the glass; the colder it gets, the more it separates, so the last sips turn chalky. Hot preparation is passable, but for iced drinks I couldn’t get a smooth, refreshing result no matter how I tweaked the ratio."
