        "source_1": "I finished the Digital Marketing course over four weekends while working full-time, and the pacing fit my schedule. The videos were mostly 8–12 minutes, and the sequence—from funnel basics to SEO, paid search, email, and analytics—felt intentional. The example where Aric walked through an ad auction really clicked; I finally understood why my Google Ads bids behave the way they do. The peer project asked me to build a basic funnel and define KPIs for a local yoga studio, and I actually used the same framework at work the next week. I added the certificate to LinkedIn and got a few recruiter messages referencing it.",
        "source_2": "I rely heavily on captions, and they tripped me up here. Marketing terms like “attribution window,” “lookalike,” and “retargeting” were often mistranscribed, and timing drifted a few seconds in multiple lectures. The audio peaked during a couple of whiteboard explanations, so I had to rewind frequently to catch the steps of the A/B testing example. I don’t need more content; I need the existing content to be easier to follow for someone reading along.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the quizzes: they didn’t challenge me. Most items were straight recall, like “which letter in AIDA stands for action,” and I finished several sets in under two minutes without opening notes. There were few scenario-based questions where I had to choose between tactics (e.g., whether to increase bid modifiers vs. refine negative keywords). I would have preferred case vignettes with metrics and a requirement to compute a simple ROI or CTR change.",
        "source_4": "As a mid-level marketer, I came in hoping for fresh takes. The frameworks were tidy, but several examples felt dated: there was a long section on EdgeRank, and nothing on GA4 or the impact of cookie deprecation on measurement. The email module skimmed segmentation without touching deliverability or DMARC, and the social section didn’t address current short-form formats or creator partnerships. The peer assignment was light—no real dataset to analyze—and the rubric rewarded surface-level answers. I’d steer colleagues with a few years of experience toward something deeper.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on the instructor: Aric keeps attention with concrete analogies—the cereal aisle example for positioning and the “leaky bucket” demo for retention made the ideas stick. He breaks equations down step by step when talking about conversion rates, and the whiteboard sessions avoid jargon. I posted a question about UTM parameters and got a clear reply in the forum within a day, which helped me clean up my campaign tracking.",
        "source_6": "I took this as a complete beginner, and the structure kept me moving. Each week opened with a roadmap video, followed by short lectures, one reading, and a quiz, then a recap tying it all together. The case study on subscription boxes helped me sketch a buyer persona for my nonprofit’s donor outreach. The quizzes forced me to revisit notes on SEO vs. SEM, and the peer review comments pointed me to a better way to define my conversion event. I wrapped in five weeks at about five hours per week and felt ready to run a small test campaign."
