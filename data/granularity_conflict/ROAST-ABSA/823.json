        "source_1": "I’m writing this just about the shower. I’m 6'1\", and the stall felt like a phone booth—maybe a square meter at most. Every time I tried to wash my hair, my elbows tapped the walls, and the curtain clung to my shoulders. The mixer was mounted close enough to my hip that I kept nudging the temperature by accident, and there wasn’t a shelf for shampoo, so the bottle sat on the floor where I had to crouch awkwardly to grab it. Water pressure was fine, but the space made it hard to turn without bumping something. If you’re taller or broader, plan for a very careful, slow rinse.",
        "source_2": "Stayed three nights and got a room that was wider than most I’ve had in Europe—two carry‑ons and a large suitcase could be opened flat without blocking the path to the bed. The bathroom was tighter than the rest of the room, and you notice it most when stepping into the shower. We ate at the hotel’s restaurant once; despite the dining room being quiet, courses came out after long gaps, so dinner stretched well past an hour. The hotel sits along the Arno, and it took me about 15 minutes to walk to the main squares at an easy pace. Wi‑Fi vouchers were sold at the desk and worked in the lobby; I used it for maps and messages before heading out. Overall, the stay felt calm and practical.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the lobby internet: I bought a voucher at the front desk (€6 for two hours), and the code worked immediately on my phone and laptop, but only in the lobby area. Speeds were enough for email, cloud docs, and checking train times; video calls were choppy unless I sat near the reception side where the signal seemed stronger. Outlets are limited, so I grabbed a seat by a pillar to charge. It was handy to have staff nearby to reset the code when mine timed out mid‑message. If you plan to upload a lot of photos, it’s doable, but bring a power bank and be ready to camp in the lobby for a bit.",
        "source_4": "I booked here for a short work trip and found the experience more cumbersome than I expected. The walk to the center took about 15–20 minutes each way, which was fine in daylight but less comfortable in the rain after meetings. Dinner at the hotel’s restaurant dragged—bread and water arrived quickly, then a long lull before a simple pasta, even though only a few tables were occupied. My room had decent floor space, yet the bathroom felt almost retrofitted, with a shower so tight I had to turn sideways to reach the soap. After a late day, needing to go downstairs to the lobby to get online was one extra step I didn’t need. Next time I’ll likely pick something closer to the sights to cut down on the small frictions.",
        "source_5": "Just commenting on the room size: for a European hotel, the layout gave me breathing room. A full‑sized desk sat opposite the bed, and I could roll my suitcase between the door and the wardrobe without clipping corners. There was space to stretch out and lay tomorrow’s clothes on a chair without stacking things on the bed. The window opened onto the river, so I had a bit of natural light in the morning, and the curtains fully closed without covering furniture. If you like to unpack and work from the room, the footprint makes it easy to keep things tidy.",
        "source_6": "Speaking only about location: being next to the Arno meant my morning walk to the cathedral area was a straight, scenic 15 minutes along the river. It’s quiet at night compared to the streets around the major sights; I slept without hearing bar noise or scooters. The trade‑off is that if you’re aiming for late dinners or nightlife in the center, the return feels longer, and I paid €12 for a taxi once when my feet gave up. There’s a bus stop nearby that shortens the trip, but I mostly preferred the stroll—good in daylight, a bit empty after 11 p.m."
