        "source_1": "I went back in early September after hearing they’d bumped the place from 3 to 4 stars, and I paid 169€ for a Classic room booked direct. The changes were noticeable: thicker duvet and crisp sheets, bathrobes waiting on the bed, a small Nespresso machine next to the kettle, and nicer toiletries than before. Breakfast had more variety—warm eggs, fresh fruit, and two kinds of croissants—and the garden felt tidier with new seating. The staff offered to arrange a taxi to Orly and printed my boarding pass, and the room’s USB outlets were handy. Given what comparable 4-star places near Parc Monceau were charging that week (200–250€), the rate didn’t feel out of place.",
        "source_2": "I tried to recreate the Mother–Daughter trip we did in August, when we paid 99€ for a refurbished twin room booked through the hotel’s site. A few weeks later I emailed to book the same setup, and the reply came back at 169€ for the Classic. That’s a 70€ jump for the same room category, and it pushed our two-night plan past what we’d budgeted. I priced alternatives in the same neighborhood and found multiple 3-star options around 110–130€, so I shelved the idea and kept my Paris dates but chose a different property.",
        "source_3": "I stayed one night on a work trip and only cared about the room details. The twin room had brand-new fixtures: a rainfall shower with strong pressure, bright vanity lighting, and tile that looked freshly laid. The beds had firmer mattresses than I remember, with a topper that cushioned just enough, and blackout curtains actually blocked the street lights. There were two outlets right by the headboard and an extra one near the desk, plus a quiet mini-fridge that didn’t hum. My window faced the interior garden, and I slept through the night without hearing the elevator or hallway chatter.",
        "source_4": "I booked a midweek solo stay and walked in with my suitcase ready to crash, but the quoted rate at check-in was 169€ for a Classic room, which stretched my per-diem. The receptionist kindly showed me the garden and pointed out the refurbished touches, and the lobby smelled like fresh flowers. Still, I ran the numbers, checked maps on my phone, and ended up moving two streets over to a 3-star for 118€ that night. I liked the vibe here—calm, tidy, and a short stroll to Ternes metro—but my expenses worksheet couldn’t absorb the jump.",
        "source_5": "I did a long weekend in November and used the hotel’s promo code from their newsletter, which brought a Classic down to 139€ and bundled breakfast. Between the quieter garden-facing room, the espresso machine, and the upgraded linens, it felt closer to what I expect in a 4-star. Breakfast had yogurt jars, sliced cheeses, and baguette stations, and the server topped up coffee without me waving. I compared my bill with two friends staying near Arc de Triomphe, and their totals were higher for similar room sizes, so the deal worked for me."
