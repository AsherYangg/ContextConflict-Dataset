        "source_1": "I took the course over two weekends, starting from scratch, and the pacing felt steady enough that I never got stuck for long. The examples build from printing a single line to reading a series of inputs, and the checkpoints after each lecture kept me moving. When I reached the final task about tracking the smallest and largest number, the Week 4 video walks through a loop that updates two variables as you go, which made the wrap-up assignment click. I liked that I could rewatch that segment and mirror the steps on my own data until my output matched.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the last exercise about finding min and max. The prompt asks you to read numbers until someone types “done” and then print the smallest and largest, but it never made clear what to set those variables to before the loop starts. The video shows the loop running but skips right past how to handle the first value or a scenario where the first input is “done” or a negative number. The downloadable reading didn’t spell out those edge cases either, so I had to dig into the forum to learn the “None-first, then compare” approach; using built-in min() and max() failed the grader.",
        "source_3": "Looking at the course as a whole, I enrolled as a true beginner and expected each concept to be unpacked slowly, but the early quizzes referenced terms like “accumulator,” “sentinel value,” and “iteration variable” before I felt familiar with them. I found myself pausing every few minutes to look up jargon and rewatch lectures, and by the time loops were introduced, I was still catching up on conditionals. The jump from simple print statements to processing a stream of inputs happened faster than I could absorb, and I ended up falling behind in Week 2. Even after taking notes, I couldn’t complete the practice tasks without checking outside resources.",
        "source_4": "Focusing strictly on the videos: the explanation for min/max is right there in Week 4, Part 1 around the 12–13 minute mark. The instructor writes out the logic—initialize two trackers, then for each new number, compare and update—and even repeats it in the recap so you see it twice. I paused at that timestamp, copied the pseudo-code into my notes, and then mirrored it in the coding window; my submission passed on the first try. If you scrub back ten seconds, there’s also a quick aside on why starting with “None” avoids problems with negative inputs.",
        "source_5": "On the written materials only: the downloadable book chapter labeled “Working with Numbers” has a section that lays out the min/max strategy step by step. It shows two approaches—starting with the first item versus starting with “None”—and runs through a sample input like 7, 2, 9, 2 with the expected output “min: 2 max: 9.” There’s even a short paragraph about handling the “done” case before any numbers are entered, which was the part I kept forgetting. I printed that page and followed it line by line to finish the assignment without needing to rewind the lectures."
