        "source_1": "I bought this as a daily phone and the slowdown was hard to ignore after a few days. Simple apps like Dialer and Messages open after a noticeable pause, and Instagram or Maps can sit on the splash screen for 5–7 seconds. Switching between YouTube and WhatsApp often makes the screen freeze for a moment, and the keyboard lags enough that I see letters appear after I finish typing. I’ve cleared cache, turned off auto-sync for a few apps, and even tried a factory reset; it helped for a day, then the delays came back. Boot takes over a minute, and tapping the camera from the lock screen is hit-or-miss if I want to catch something quickly.",
        "source_2": "I assumed there would be a fingerprint sensor at this price, but there isn’t one, so I’m stuck with a PIN or pattern every single time. Quick unlocks at the grocery counter for UPI approvals turn into multiple taps and swipes, and gloves make it worse in winter. I tried third-party app locks to speed things up, but they add another layer that occasionally crashes. Friends bought phones under 8k with a fingerprint reader that unlocks in a tap, so the extra steps here stand out during a busy day.",
        "source_3": "I picked this up for my mom for 7,499 as a simple device, and for her usage it’s been fine. Calls are clear, WhatsApp messages come in quickly, and YouTube at 480p plays without stutter. After the first big update finished, apps like Gallery and Chrome open in about a second or two, and she hasn’t reported freezes. She doesn’t need a fingerprint reader—pattern lock works for her—and the battery easily covers morning to night with light use. For basic tasks and a few family photos, it behaves predictably.",
        "source_4": "Paying around 7.5k, I expected quicker app launches and a convenience unlock. In the store, similarly priced models opened Instagram and Camera faster and had a fingerprint reader on the back or side. With this one, the grocery app took long enough at checkout that the cashier asked me to step aside, and unlocking with a pattern added a few extra moments under pressure. After a week of this routine, I exchanged it for another model that shaved off those delays.",
        "source_5": "After disabling a bunch of preloaded apps and turning off animations in developer options, the phone became more usable. Facebook now opens in roughly 2–3 seconds and Gmail doesn’t stall when pulling in new mail, though switching quickly between three or more apps still leads to brief freezes. Games like Subway Surfers run, but frame drops show up when notifications arrive. The lack of a fingerprint sensor is the main daily annoyance—I enter a pattern dozens of times. If you keep only the essentials installed and don’t multitask much, the experience stays manageable."
