        "source_1": "I bought the Redmi two months ago mainly for the battery claims, and it’s been puzzling. With mobile data off, Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth off, and no apps running, the battery still drops about 2–3% every couple of hours while it just sits on my desk. Battery stats usually show “Phone idle” and “Android System” at the top. Airplane mode reduces it a bit, but I still see around 1% per hour overnight. I even did a factory reset and tested with only the default apps, same pattern. AccuBattery estimates around 4,200 mAh out of the rated pack, which lines up with the slow but constant trickle.",
        "source_2": "My issue is heat more than anything. The upper back near the camera warms up during simple tasks like Instagram scrolling or a 10‑minute video call. While charging with the included 33W brick, CPU‑Z shows temps hitting 42–43°C and the case gets toasty enough that I take it off to cool faster. Even basic map navigation makes it warm in my pocket. Games are a no‑go for me because the phone throttles after a few minutes and the frame rate stutters.",
        "source_3": "Switching from an iPhone, I braced for compromises, but this Redmi has been a smooth daily driver for me. With dual SIM active, WhatsApp, Telegram, light photos, and an hour of YouTube, I end most days with 25–30% left. Standby last night was a 1% drop over about 7 hours. I haven’t noticed unusual warmth except during long 4K recording sessions. MIUI’s gesture navigation and the customization options are convenient, the screen stays readable outdoors, and calls are crisp. For what I paid, it does everything I need without fuss.",
        "source_4": "I tried to sort out the idle drain and occasional warmth through Redmi’s support. The authorized center kept my phone for two days, ran diagnostics, and said everything was “within spec,” then reflashed the software. Nothing changed. When I emailed, I got template replies and was told to wait for a future update. I asked about a replacement since the issue started early on, but they said I was past the window. After three visits and a lot of back‑and‑forth, I’m basically told to live with it.",
        "source_5": "After two months, my overall take isn’t great. The phone loses a couple of percent even when untouched overnight, and it heats up during casual browsing or when using Maps for a short drive. I’ve turned off auto‑sync, restricted background activity for most apps, disabled Bluetooth and Wi‑Fi when I don’t need them—no real change. Preinstalled apps keep nudging me with notifications, and I’ve spent too much time tweaking settings to keep the battery from slipping away. I’m thinking about going back to iOS just to stop fiddling with these basics."
