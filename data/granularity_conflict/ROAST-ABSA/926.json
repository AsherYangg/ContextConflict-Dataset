        "source_1": "I finished the course in three weeks by watching 30–45 minutes each evening, and the sequence of topics made it easy for me to build on earlier lectures. The case walkthroughs moved from simple scenarios to multi-step problems, which helped me connect the dots without jumping around. I took notes in a spiral notebook and found myself referencing them during a team meeting the next day. The certificate issued right away and synced to my LinkedIn profile without any hiccups.",
        "source_2": "I want to comment only on the quizzes: the Week 2 assessment had several items that didn’t line up with what was covered. Question 7 referenced an approach that didn’t appear until the next module, and Question 3 had two choices that both matched the definition given in the transcript. The time limit felt tight, and the retry option locked after two attempts even though the instructions suggested three. I ended up combing through discussion threads to figure out if the answer key had been updated, and it looked like it changed midweek without a notice.",
        "source_3": "I took the course entirely on my phone with captions on, and the subtitles were consistently out of sync by 2–3 seconds. Technical terms were transcribed inconsistently across videos, so I kept pausing to read the slide text to confirm what was said. Several slides used tiny fonts and thin lines, which were hard to make out on a 6-inch screen even at full brightness. The downloadable transcript didn’t include figure labels or alt text, so matching the narration to the diagrams took extra effort.",
        "source_4": "After finishing all five modules, I felt the material repeated concepts across Weeks 3 and 4 with the same examples, and multiple external reading links returned 404 errors. The examples leaned on screenshots from older software versions, so replicating the steps on my setup required guesswork. The pacing stretched out what could have been a crisp presentation into many short clips that often recapped the previous one. Peer feedback on the final project took nine days to arrive, and two of the three reviewers left a single sentence with no rubric checkmarks, which left me unsure what to revise.",
        "source_5": "I only used the downloadable resources and skipped most videos, and the checklists and one-page summaries turned into my quick references at work. The Module 3 cheat sheet gave me a clean sequence of steps I followed during a client call, and the example template saved me from starting a slide deck from scratch. I printed the summary cards and taped them above my monitor, and they’ve become my go-to when I need a reminder in the middle of a task.",
        "source_6": "I’m focusing on the peer-graded assignment: the rubric asked for “clear justification” but didn’t define what counted as sufficient evidence, so I submitted two versions just to be safe. One reviewer flagged a formatting issue that wasn’t mentioned anywhere, while another said the analysis needed more depth without pointing to a specific section. The system required three reviews to release my grade, and it took a full week to get that third review. I would have preferred at least one example of a top-scoring submission to calibrate my work before turning it in."
