        "source_1": "I booked a standard room at Dorsett Seaview and want to comment only on the layout/size. The footprint is compact—roughly the width of a queen bed plus an 18–20 inch walkway—so the bed is pushed against one wall. A fold-down desk and a wall-mounted kettle shelf save floor space, and my 22-inch carry-on slid under the bed without trouble. There are six wall hooks and a narrow rail for hangers, which helped keep the floor clear. The corner shower uses a sliding door that prevents the bathroom door from clashing, so the space feels organized even though it’s tight.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about cleanliness, so I checked the room top to bottom at Dorsett Seaview. The headboard and bedside ledge passed the white-tissue test with no dust, and the AC vent fins looked recently wiped. Bathroom grout was bright and there was no mildew smell; the mirror had no water spots. Towels arrived dry and fresh each afternoon, amenities were replenished, and the trash was cleared daily. I also checked under the bed with my phone flashlight and didn’t spot crumbs or forgotten items.",
        "source_3": "Focusing purely on comfort, I slept well at Dorsett Seaview. The mattress felt medium-firm with no sag, and the two pillow types (one thicker, one flatter) made it easy to find a good neck position. The blackout curtains blocked the neon from Temple Street, and I didn’t hear corridor noise after about 11 p.m. The AC remote let me set 21°C with a steady medium fan, and the air didn’t feel stuffy during the night.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, my stay didn’t go the way I hoped. Our double room felt so tight that the only place to open a suitcase flat was on the bed, and the sealed window made the air feel heavy even with the AC running. I woke up with a tight chest and a mild headache, and the walls had scuff marks that made the place seem worn. We also found stray hairs in the shower on arrival, which put me off. We were booked for four nights but checked out after the first; the desk offered a paid upgrade, and we chose to move to another hotel in Kowloon instead. Once we switched, we finally slept easily.",
        "source_5": "For an overall impression, my three-night stay at Dorsett Seaview went smoothly. Check-in took about five minutes, the lift was quick even at peak times, and my room on a higher floor stayed quiet despite the busy street below. The space is compact, but the bed and pillows worked for me and I never had trouble with temperature. Wi‑Fi averaged around 40 Mbps down, enough for video calls, and housekeeping kept the room tidy each afternoon. The Temple Street area is lively and the MTR is a short walk, so getting to meetings was straightforward; I’d book here again for quick trips."
