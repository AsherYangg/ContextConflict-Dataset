        "source_1": "I bought these specifically for the chocolate note, and it’s absolutely there for me. On my Keurig K-Select, an 8 oz cup with the Strong button fills the kitchen with a cocoa aroma, and the sip finishes with a dry cocoa powder vibe rather than just sweetness. I tried it black and again with a splash of half-and-half; in both cases the chocolate stayed front and center. If I go up to 10 oz it dilutes, but at 6–8 oz the chocolate shows up every time.",
        "source_2": "These pods are extremely sensitive to brew size and temperature, which makes or breaks the cup. On my K-Elite, 6 oz with the Strong setting gives a concentrated, syrupy body; 8 oz is fine; 10–12 oz turns thin and hollow. Using filtered water (Brita) and the hottest setting consistently tightened the flavor. If you want a fuller cup, keep it at 6–8 oz and avoid topping off with extra hot water.",
        "source_3": "I think the quality swings between boxes. My first order in December had a rich cocoa smell and I went through the 24-count quickly because it paired nicely with oatmeal in the mornings. The reorder in March (lot code L310, best by 07/2025) tasted flat and a little acrid no matter the size, and two pods leaked grounds into the cup. If you get a box like my first one, it feels like a dessert coffee; if you get the second type, it’s a chore to finish.",
        "source_4": "This has become my default afternoon cup at work. I run an 8 oz brew on a Keurig K-Compact and add a small splash of milk; the aroma fills the break room and the chocolate note plays well with a biscotti. After three boxes (72 pods), every pod punctured cleanly, no plastic smell, and no sludge at the bottom. A couple coworkers tried mine and ended up switching their mid-day cup to these.",
        "source_5": "Flavor-wise, my box missed the mark. The label suggests chocolate, but what I get is a woody, bitter taste with a lingering aftertaste, even on the smallest 6 oz setting. I tried three pods from different sleeves on a freshly descaled K-Supreme with filtered water and poured out each cup after a sip or two. Best-by 08/2025 and foil seals intact, so I don’t think storage was the culprit."
