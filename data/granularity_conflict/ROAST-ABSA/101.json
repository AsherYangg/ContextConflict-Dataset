        "source_1": "I bought this salt to use as a finishing touch, and a tiny pinch makes roasted carrots and scrambled eggs taste brighter without loading up the plate. The flakes dissolve quickly on hot food, so half of what I used to shake from the table salt is enough. Even on sliced tomatoes, a couple of crystals seem to wake up the sweetness rather than just make it salty.",
        "source_2": "The product is fine, but the cost stings. I paid $14.99 for a pouch that weighed less than what I get from a $3 canister at the grocery store, and cooking for a family of four means I went through it in about three weeks. At this size and price, it feels like a treat rather than a pantry staple, so I won’t be refilling it regularly.",
        "source_3": "Shipping wasn’t smooth for me. I ordered on a Monday expecting two-day arrival for a Thursday dinner, and it didn’t show up until Saturday evening. The outer box was dented and the inner bag had split at the seal, so flakes were loose inside the package. I ended up running to the store for a last-minute backup.",
        "source_4": "After a month with this salt, I’ve basically retired the blue canister. Sautéed zucchini tastes cleaner, buttered corn has more character, and a light dusting on pan-seared salmon gets my kids asking what I changed in the recipe. I decant it into a small pinch bowl by the stove and reach for it at nearly every meal, then add a few crystals at the table. I’m already setting up a regular reorder because it’s become part of my routine.",
        "source_5": "I tried it on steak, roasted potatoes, and even avocado toast, and the flavor didn’t sit right with me—there’s a sharp edge that lingers. The crystals are big enough that they crunch unpleasantly unless I pre-crush them, and even then they don’t melt well on cooler foods. I kept adding more to chase that balanced seasoning and ended up with salty bites that overpowered the dish.",
        "source_6": "My order landed the next afternoon after a late-night purchase, packed in bubble wrap with the resealable pouch intact. I stacked a coupon with a subscribe-and-save discount, so the per-ounce cost actually beat my local gourmet shop by a noticeable margin. For once, getting it online was both quicker and cheaper than a store run."
