        "source_1": "I picked this up for my dad because the body felt right in his hand. The textured back doesn’t slide on smooth tables, the edges are curved so his palm doesn’t get sore, and the power button is raised enough that he can find it without looking. The screen has a high-contrast mode and a simple layout that makes the icons easy to spot, and the weight is light enough that he can hold it during long calls without fatigue. Even the camera bump is designed so it doesn’t rock when he types on a desk. I’m only commenting on the physical design here, not how it runs day to day.",
        "source_2": "Around the sixth week, the phone began restarting on its own every few hours—no warning, just a black screen and the boot logo. I tried safe mode, clearing cache, and uninstalling a couple of launchers, but the loop kept coming back. An over-the-air update downloaded overnight and the next morning it was stuck rebooting at the setup screen. The service desk did a firmware flash, it booted in the store, and then when I got home it shut down completely and wouldn’t take a charge. The worst part was losing the call logs I’d saved for my father’s medical appointments.",
        "source_3": "My experience with the company’s service center was smooth. I walked into the main branch near the mall, grabbed a token, and within fifteen minutes a technician ran diagnostics. They suspected a board issue, ordered the part on the spot, and I got SMS updates at each step. The phone was back in my hands the next afternoon with a fresh warranty card and a printout of the work done. The staff didn’t rush me; they showed me how to run a hardware test and explained what to look for if the problem reappears.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday device, it’s been a solid buy for my father. Calls over VoLTE are clear, the speaker is loud enough for him to hear without turning on subtitles on videos, and the battery easily covers two days with light use—mostly WhatsApp, a few photos of prescriptions, and morning news clips. The interface has a senior mode that enlarges text and simplifies the home screen. The camera isn’t fancy, but documents and QR codes are readable. I did run into a single freeze after installing a payments app; a quick cache clear fixed it and it hasn’t happened again.",
        "source_5": "I got drawn in by the low sticker price and regretted it. At about a month and a half, the device began rebooting in the middle of calls, then one evening it went dark and never came back. I dropped it at the authorized center and was told parts would arrive “tomorrow,” which turned into a week of daily check-ins and no phone for my dad, who relies on the SOS contact shortcut. They keep saying the board is on back order, and I’m stuck juggling a borrowed handset and missed appointments. If I had known the downtime would stretch this long, I would’ve chosen differently.",
        "source_6": "Focusing just on the battery: overnight drain is roughly 12–15% with airplane mode on, and screen-on time averages around three and a half hours with basic messaging and calls. Charging from 20% to full takes a little over two hours with the included brick. I toggled battery saver and disabled background sync for a couple of apps, but the standby drain didn’t shift much. For someone who forgets to plug in, that means mid-afternoon top-ups are common. I don’t have complaints or praise about other parts of the phone here—just sharing what I’ve seen with power use."
