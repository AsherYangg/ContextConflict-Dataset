        "source_1": "I booked a standard double and the room felt tighter than expected. I had to slide my suitcase under the desk because there wasn’t enough floor space to lay it flat, and there was maybe a foot of clearance on either side of the bed. The bathroom door nearly touched the toilet when it swung in, and the shower was a narrow cubicle where my elbows kept brushing the walls. It worked for one person with a backpack, but sharing it with my partner and two carry-ons was awkward.",
        "source_2": "I only used the hotel for breakfast before catching a train, and it impressed me. At 7:00 a.m. the buffet had fresh berries, Greek yogurt, granola, sliced cheeses, smoked salmon, and pastries that were still warm. A cook prepared eggs to order, and the coffee machine pulled a solid espresso. Staff kept refilling items without being asked, and there was gluten-free bread available on request.",
        "source_3": "I stayed one night while visiting family and the place did what I needed. I emailed ahead for a quiet room and feather-free pillows and was given a top-floor room away from the lift with hypoallergenic bedding already on the bed. The room was tidy, the bed supportive, and the toiletries included shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. Check-in and check-out took only a couple of minutes, and I’d happily book the same hotel the next time I’m in London.",
        "source_4": "Weekend stopover that felt cramped from start to finish. The corridors were narrow and the room had no real spot to open two suitcases at once. Our window looked onto a brick wall, and by 8:30 a.m. the breakfast room was packed enough that we circled for five minutes to find a seat. The food itself was fine, but with the crowding and the tight quarters in the room, I’ll look elsewhere on my next visit.",
        "source_5": "I’m reviewing the staff specifically because they made the stay smooth. I’d emailed two requests—an early check-in around 1 p.m. and a baby cot—and both were sorted before we arrived. The cot was already set up with clean linens, and when I called for extra towels and a spare toothbrush, housekeeping knocked within ten minutes. The front desk team greeted us by name each time we passed through the lobby.",
        "source_6": "Focusing on breakfast only: I went down at 9:00 a.m. and the selection was thin. The hot trays had been picked over—only scrambled eggs and beans left—and the fruit bowls were down to a few bruised pieces. Gluten-free bread ran out and took a while to replenish, so I ended up with toast and yogurt. Maybe it’s better earlier, but late-morning options felt limited."
