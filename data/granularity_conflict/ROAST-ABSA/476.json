        "source_1": "I bought this mostly to take quick photos of my kids, and the camera surprised me in daylight. At the park around noon, portraits had clean edge detection and natural skin tones, and the HDR kept the sky from blowing out. The shutter fired without noticeable delay, and the autofocus kept up with a running toddler and a tugging dog on the same frame. I posted several shots straight to Instagram without tweaking, and even 2x digital zoom held detail on signboards across the street.",
        "source_2": "I tested it purely for gaming out of curiosity: COD Mobile and Asphalt 9 installed, graphics set to medium/balanced. COD held close to 55–60 fps for three matches, with only brief dips during explosions; Asphalt felt steady, and touch response was consistent with no ghost taps. After about 35 minutes, the back got warm near the top, but it didn’t throttle hard, and I could hop in and out of WhatsApp without the game needing to reload.",
        "source_3": "I set this up for my father with large icons and basic apps (calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome). Over a week of morning news videos and evening video calls, apps opened quickly and stayed in memory, and he didn’t mention any freezes while switching between messages and the dialer. Call quality on speaker was clear enough for him to hear without holding it to his ear, and auto-brightness kept the screen readable indoors and on the balcony.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on battery: with a single Airtel SIM on 4G, I got through a full workday with 90 minutes of calls, about 2 hours of YouTube at 50% brightness, 30 minutes of Google Maps, and some photos, ending around 22%. Standby drain overnight was about 3% with Wi‑Fi on. Using the bundled 15W charger, it went from 18% to full in just under two hours.",
        "source_5": "My experience centers on performance hiccups. The keyboard lags half a second in WhatsApp after switching from Chrome, and the Play Store takes ages to load app pages on the same Wi‑Fi that my older phone handles fine. Opening the camera from the lock screen often pauses on a black viewfinder for 2–3 seconds, and returning to a previously opened app frequently forces a reload. After 10 minutes of Instagram Reels, the top-right area gets hot, and scrolling starts to stutter.",
        "source_6": "As an everyday device, it’s been frustrating: twice this week the dialer froze and I couldn’t answer before the call ended, and UPI payments in my banking app hung on the spinner until I force-closed it. Indoor photos from a birthday dinner came out flat and grainy, and switching between the camera and messages took long enough that I missed moments. On my train commute, it dropped the network during handoffs between towers more than once, and Bluetooth audio to my car occasionally cut out mid-call."
