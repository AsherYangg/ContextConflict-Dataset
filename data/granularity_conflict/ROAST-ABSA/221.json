        "source_1": "I got this in a gift basket and ended up finishing the box in two weeks. One sachet in a 12 oz mug at about 195°F for 4 minutes gives me a smooth cup without the sharp bite I get from some cinnamon-heavy blends. It has a round spice profile—cinnamon and orange peel are what I notice most—and I don’t need to add sugar or milk. It reminds me of Good Earth’s classic blend but a touch softer, and it holds up fine on a second steep for an afternoon cup at work.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on sweetness: even at a short 2–3 minute steep, the cup leans syrupy for me, with a lingering stevia-like note I can’t shake. I tried dialing it back with cooler water and also blended half-and-half with a plain black tea to tone it down, but the clove and sweet finish still dominated. Iced didn’t help either; it came across like spiced candy water, so I kept a lemon wedge handy to cut through it.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I kept waiting for the flavor to match the aroma and it never quite got there. The kitchen smelled fantastic, but in the cup I had to use two bags for a 10 oz mug and push to 6 minutes at near-boiling to get any real body. Even then it felt thin, with a papery aftertaste that reminded me the bags aren’t super robust. Friends who like lighter teas were fine with it; I wanted a fuller sip.",
        "source_4": "I’m zeroing in on packaging quality here. My box arrived with three sachets split at the seam, which left tea dust floating around and a gritty layer at the bottom of the mug. A few tags detached when I tugged the strings, so fishing out the bags was messy. When the bags were intact, the liquor came out clear and the spice balance seemed bright, but the construction issues were distracting enough that I repacked the rest in a tin.",
        "source_5": "Full disclosure: I never got to try this because my roommates ran through the whole box in a week. They were brewing a pot every morning and kept calling it “awesome,” pouring travel mugs on their way to class and adding nothing but hot water. I can’t speak to the taste firsthand; I’m just passing along that I kept seeing empty sachets in the sink and a lot of repeat brewing.",
        "source_6": "I’m sensitive to bitterness, so I tested it by oversteeping on purpose—5 to 6 minutes in 8 oz at just-off-boil—and it stayed smooth without the tongue-drying edge I dread. With a splash of oat milk it turned into a cozy, dessert-like cup, and straight up it worked after dinner without buzzing me awake. For anyone who nurses a mug while reading, it seems forgiving even if you forget the timer."
