        "source_1": "After a month with the phone, I’m struggling with day-to-day use. Opening Gmail while a Zoom call is ongoing, the interface drags; switching to Maps takes 4–5 seconds; twice the screen stopped responding entirely and the phone locked up, forcing a long-press on power + volume to recover. The on-screen back and home gestures sometimes ignore swipes, and during a payment app checkout the keyboard wouldn’t appear. The upside is the battery gets me from 7 a.m. to late evening, but I bought it expecting snappy performance for work, and it hasn’t matched that.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on the battery because that’s my priority. Charged to 90% at 7 a.m., I stream about an hour of Spotify over Bluetooth, run GPS for 25 minutes, browse and chat on WhatsApp all day, take a handful of photos, and by 10 p.m. I’m still around 35–40%. Overnight it drops 2–3%. With the stock charger, it goes from 20% to 80% in roughly 32–35 minutes. No gaming here, just mixed use, and the endurance has been consistent for several weeks.",
        "source_3": "The buttons and touch input act unpredictable. The power button sometimes needs two or three presses before the screen wakes. The volume rocker misses inputs unless I press firmly. A few times the navigation gestures stopped working mid-app; swiping up did nothing until I locked and unlocked the phone. While filling out a long form in Chrome, the keyboard refused to pop up, and the touch area near the bottom edge wouldn’t register taps. I cleared cache, reset settings, and installed the latest update—the issue still shows up every couple of days.",
        "source_4": "Performance has been the sticking point for me. Even light multitasking makes it stumble: switching from WhatsApp to the camera leaves a spinner for several seconds; opening Maps while music is playing freezes the UI; Instagram reels stutter and sometimes the app relaunches. Twice this week the phone paused on a black screen and then rebooted by itself. Animations drop frames, and apps frequently reload when I return to them, as if they were kicked out of memory.",
        "source_5": "For my usage, the device has been fine. I set it up with WhatsApp, banking, Gmail, and a few social apps. It handles calls, messages, photos, and YouTube without drama, and I haven’t run into any freezes. I don’t game, and I keep background apps minimal. Battery gets me through the day, and the fingerprint reader works reliably. If you’re expecting desktop-level speed with ten apps open, you might want something higher tier, but as a daily driver for basic tasks it fits what I need."
