        "source_1": "I stayed at the Holiday Inn Miami – Airport West for a quick layover before a 6:15 a.m. flight. Check-in around 9:45 p.m. took under five minutes, and the front desk printed my boarding pass without making me hunt for the lobby computer. My room (524) smelled fresh when I opened the door, the floors and bathroom looked recently updated, and the hallway stayed calm even with a baseball team on my floor. I slept with the blackout curtains fully closed and didn’t hear aircraft on approach. The morning shuttle left on time at 4:45 a.m. and dropped me at American’s departures in under ten minutes.",
        "source_2": "Focusing on noise only: I was placed on what the desk called the 9th floor, and the bass from a club upstairs shook the headboard until about 2 a.m. Both nights. You could feel the thump through the pillow. I called down and was told there was an event and it would end soon, but it dragged on. Even with earplugs, the vibration wasn’t something I could tune out. If you’re a light sleeper, ask to be as far from the music as possible or a lower floor away from the venue.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the room condition only: My room (212) had scuffed furniture, a loose handle on the nightstand, and the carpet near the desk had a dark stain that looked old. The AC unit clicked every few minutes, like a relay switching on and off, which made working at the desk a chore. Housekeeping missed the extra towel request I left on the card; I called after returning from dinner and got two towels brought up, but the wait was close to half an hour.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on staff/service only: The front desk agent, Maria, noticed I was juggling a stroller and two carry-ons at midnight and immediately offered bottled water and a crib without me asking. She arranged a 3:30 a.m. wake-up call plus a backup call “just in case,” and the shuttle driver waited an extra minute for me when my elevator got stuck on 3. They also held my Instacart delivery behind the counter and called my room when it arrived so it wouldn’t be left in the lobby. Small touches, but they made a hectic travel day manageable.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on location/shuttle only: On the map it’s a short hop from MIA, but the pickup at the airport took 35 minutes because the shuttle loops several hotels. At 5 a.m., the ride back to the terminal made three stops, so a distance that would be a five-minute ride in an Uber turned into a 25-minute circuit. If you’re tight on time, budget for the wait and the stops; the distance is close, but the route isn’t direct.",
        "source_6": "Overall experience across two nights: I booked “Airport West” but first went to the Holiday Inn by the rental car center because that’s what the rideshare suggested. After realizing it wasn’t the right one, I took another car to the West property, which added nearly an hour to my night. Once there, the building had no rooftop spot like I expected, and the restaurant I’d read about wasn’t on an upper floor. The front desk sorted me out quickly, and the room itself was fine for sleep, but the confusion between the two similarly named hotels and the extra transfers overshadowed the convenience I was aiming for."
