        "source_1": "I grew up on JIF and Peter Pan, so I mixed this powder with water (2 tbsp powder to 1.5 tbsp water) and tried it on toast. The texture came out pasty and a little chalky, and the flavor felt muted—more roasted peanut smell than actual peanut taste. I added a pinch of salt and even a drizzle of honey, but it still didn’t hit that sweet-salty punch I get from the shelf peanut butter. I ended up scraping most of it off my bread and switched to dipping apple slices in it, which was better but still thin on flavor.",
        "source_2": "I usually buy peanut-only jars that separate and need stirring, so this was a pleasant change. With 2 tbsp powder, 1 tbsp water, a dash of salt, and a few drops of maple extract, I got a spread that was smooth and actually held together on whole wheat toast. It tasted like fresh-roasted peanuts without the oily sheen, and it didn’t weigh down my breakfast. I also stirred a spoonful into warm oatmeal with cinnamon, and it melted in nicely without pools of oil on top.",
        "source_3": "Focused on shakes only: I use 2 scoops (about 12 g) in a blender bottle with 1 scoop chocolate whey, 8 oz unsweetened almond milk, and ice. It dissolves cleanly with a few shakes, adds real peanut aroma, and keeps my shake under 300 calories for a weekday lunch. Compared with a spoonful of regular peanut butter, this gives me the flavor I want without turning the drink into a calorie bomb or gumming up the shaker ball.",
        "source_4": "Calorie angle from the opposite side: To get the same peanut punch I’m used to on a rice cake, I need closer to 4 tbsp of the powder plus water, then I end up adding a little honey and salt. By the time I’m satisfied, the calories creep up and I’m not far off from what a tablespoon of regular peanut butter would have cost me. So for me, the supposed savings didn’t really materialize once I made it taste the way I like.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two weeks: I keep the jar at my desk for quick snacks—mix a small scoop with water, spread on a high-fiber tortilla, and roll with a banana. It also worked in a Sunday breakfast: whisked into egg whites for a peanutty French toast topping on low-cal bread with sugar-free syrup. If you expect it to mimic the sweetness and gloss of JIF straight out of the gate, it probably won’t. If you’re used to the simpler taste of natural peanut butter, it comes together nicely with a pinch of salt and the right water ratio.",
        "source_6": "Single aspect—mixability complaints: In my smoothies (frozen berries, Greek yogurt, water), the powder clumps and sticks to the sides of the blender, so I end up with dry flecks unless I pre-slurry it in a separate cup first. Even then, a faint graininess hangs around. It’s workable if I blend twice and scrape the pitcher walls, but that defeats the convenience I was after."
