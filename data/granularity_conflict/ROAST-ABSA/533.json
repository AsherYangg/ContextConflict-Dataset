        "source_1": "I buy these for weekend sandwiches and grazing during movies, and the flavor really lands where I want it—seasoning isn’t shy, but it doesn’t drown out the potato. The chips have a steady crunch that holds up in salsa without getting soggy, and there’s none of that greasy film that makes you stop halfway through. I’ve had consistent freshness across a few shipments, with that telltale small blistering on the surface that usually means a good fry.",
        "source_2": "I ordered the 12-pack that’s listed at 9 oz per bag and put three random bags on my OXO Good Grips scale, zeroed with a bowl. Each read right around 8.1 oz of contents. Multiply the 0.9 oz shortfall by the 12-pack and you’re down about 10.8 oz across the case—basically a whole bag missing. The carton had lot L23091 and “best by” 03/2025, and the individual bags themselves don’t mention a size change, but the product page still shows 9 oz.",
        "source_3": "After two boxes, here’s my overall take: the taste is steady, the crunch feels fresh, and the chips don’t leave a slick residue on fingers. What threw me was the weight variation—my first box lined up with the 9 oz listing, while the second averaged closer to 8.2 oz per bag when I spot-checked three. Same UPC and similar “best by” ranges, different fill. The price hasn’t moved, so the per-ounce value shifted without any clear notice.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on size and style options: the listing mixes “classic,” “family,” and “party” thumbnails, but the detailed page says 9 oz. The bags I received are printed 8.1 oz with a “new pack” badge in tiny font, which wasn’t obvious in the carousel images. I needed 9 oz bags to hit portion targets for a tailgate spread, and the smaller fill meant I had to open extra bags to match the plan. If the seller is transitioning sizes, the options aren’t labeled clearly enough to choose confidently.",
        "source_5": "I saw comments about underfilled bags, so I checked mine with a tared Escali scale. I weighed just the contents after subtracting the empty bag and bowl: 255 g, 253 g, and 256 g across three pulls, which aligns with 9 oz. Lot codes were L23114 with “best by” 04/2025. Packaging looks identical to photos others posted, so either different production runs are going out or the fill varies by batch. For my case, the bags matched the listed weight.",
        "source_6": "Overall, these fit into my lunch routine well—the flavor is familiar, the texture is crisp, and the smaller 8.1 oz bags slot neatly into pantry bins without toppling everything. One bag stretches to two sandwiches with a side, which works for me. The product page still mentions 9 oz, but I haven’t had to adjust anything beyond opening a second bag once when serving a few extra people."
