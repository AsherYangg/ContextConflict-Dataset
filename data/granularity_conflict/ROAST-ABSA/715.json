        "source_1": "I spent two nights here for a midweek work trip and the property itself has a lot going for it: stylish lobby, friendly front desk, and a fun energy in the evenings. My tab climbed faster than expected—$289 per night plus taxes, then another $20 per night to park in the attached garage. The bar became my nightly routine; the mojito was bright and minty and the pina colada came out creamy, not sugary. My only gripe was the bed in my king room felt on the firmer side, and I woke up a bit stiff. The room faced the courtyard, and despite that, hallway noise filtered in around 11 p.m.",
        "source_2": "I only care about costs, and this place taught me to read the fine print. The base rate looked decent at $229, but after city taxes and a facility fee, it rang up to $275. Self-parking added $20 per night, and the bar tab crept up with $14 cocktails and $9 beers. Even breakfast wasn’t cheap—$18 for eggs and toast. None of these line items are hidden, but the final bill was a surprise compared to what I thought I’d spend when I first clicked “book.”",
        "source_3": "I’m local and use the hotel bar as my meetup spot. The bartenders actually muddle the mint for the mojito instead of using a premix, and the pina colada has a silky texture that comes from real coconut cream. Seating is comfy without feeling crowded, and on Thursday nights there’s a laid-back playlist that makes conversation easy. I can’t speak to the rooms, but as a place to unwind after work, it hits the mark.",
        "source_4": "My review is just about the bed because that makes or breaks a stay for me. I had a two-queen room on the sixth floor, and the mattress felt cushy with a pillow-top that let my shoulder sink in—ideal for side sleepers. The linens were crisp, and the pillows had enough loft that I didn’t stack them. I slept straight through until my alarm, which I rarely do on the road, and didn’t wake up with neck or lower back tightness.",
        "source_5": "Four nights for a conference, booked on points through my loyalty program. Because I didn’t rent a car, I can’t speak to parking fees, but overall costs felt manageable—most of my spend was on snacks and a couple of cocktails. The bed leaned firm; not a dealbreaker, but I did ask housekeeping for an extra blanket to add a bit of cushion. Friday evening the bar got loud with a group celebrating something, so I took my drink back to the lobby seating area where it was calmer.",
        "source_6": "We drove in for a weekend getaway and dealt with the parking firsthand. The garage entry is tight, but well-lit, and the attendant offered valet or self-park; we chose self-park at $15 on Sunday night and $20 on Saturday. Elevators connect directly to the lobby, and paying at the kiosk was quick—no hunting for validation. For what it’s worth, our car felt secure, and we never waited more than a minute or two to exit even at checkout time."
