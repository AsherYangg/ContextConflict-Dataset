        "source_1": "I stayed here for four nights on a first trip to Beijing and felt taken care of from the moment I arrived. Check-in was swift; the front desk offered a city map and marked a route to Wangfujing that took me about 10 minutes at a relaxed pace. My room overlooked a quiet courtyard, housekeeping refreshed it daily without fuss, and the breakfast spread had an omelet station, congee, and fresh fruit that didn’t run out even at 9:30 a.m. We tried the hotel’s restaurant one evening—Peking duck with crisp skin and warm pancakes—and then unwound in the pool and sauna for an hour. The staff arranged a taxi to the Forbidden City and wrote the destination in Mandarin so the driver understood. I would choose the same place again for another visit.",
        "source_2": "I’m only reviewing the breakfast since my room rate included it. Across three mornings (around 7:45–8:15 a.m.), the hot trays were inconsistent: scrambled eggs sat under lamps but were barely warm, bacon was chewy, and pastries tasted dry as if left out overnight. Coffee came from a machine and had a diluted flavor; the line for cappuccinos stalled when the milk ran out and took five minutes to fix. Staff clearing tables seemed short-handed—several spots had dirty plates even though the dining room wasn’t full. By the third day I skipped the buffet and grabbed baozi from a street vendor near the subway entrance.",
        "source_3": "I rely on English when traveling, and my experience with staff varied by shift. Daytime front desk staff understood me well and helped with directions, but the late-night team struggled with a request to book a 5:30 a.m. car to the airport. The reservation ended up for the wrong day, and I only caught it when the printed slip showed a different date. The concierge also misinterpreted “Forbidden City timed tickets” as a tour package and sent me to a different desk that only accepted cash. I eventually used a translation app to clarify. Friendly people, but if you’re monolingual and need precise arrangements, double-check everything.",
        "source_4": "I used the leisure facilities each evening after sightseeing and found them hit-or-miss. The gym is compact—three treadmills, two bikes, a cable machine, and dumbbells that top out at 10 kg—fine for light sessions but limited for strength work. The pool felt chilly, and around 6 p.m. it was busy with families, which made lap swimming tough; several times I had to wait for a lane. The locker room ran out of towels on two nights, and the steam room had an “under maintenance” sign the entire week. Staff offered bottled water, but I ended up scheduling workouts in the morning to avoid the crowding.",
        "source_5": "I picked this hotel mainly for the location and it delivered on that front. From the lobby, it’s about a 10-minute walk to Wangfujing along well-lit streets, and 15–20 minutes to the Forbidden City if you take the route past the National Museum. The subway is close; Line 1 got me to Tian’anmen East in two stops. I liked that signage around the area is bilingual, and the hotel’s printed map matched what I saw outside, so I didn’t get turned around. Be prepared for big intersections and long crossings—the timing favors cars—so plan a few extra minutes. I carried pocket tissues when out since some public restrooms didn’t have supplies.",
        "source_6": "My focus is the room itself (deluxe king, 12th floor). It was tidy, but the bed felt quite firm and I woke up stiff the first night; housekeeping brought a thin topper that helped only a little. The A/C cooled the room, yet it took nearly an hour to bring the temperature down after I returned from the afternoon heat. Water pressure in the shower fluctuated when neighboring rooms were in use, and the bathroom ventilation left a faint bleach smell lingering after cleaning. Street-facing windows let in early morning traffic noise despite being closed. If you’re sensitive to sound and prefer a softer mattress, request an interior room and extra padding at check-in."
