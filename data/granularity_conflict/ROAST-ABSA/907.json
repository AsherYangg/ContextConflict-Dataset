        "source_1": "I picked the Westin for a quick Broadway weekend because everyone says it’s perfect for shows, but getting to my theater on 47th took me almost 25 minutes at a brisk pace. Cabs were useless before curtain because traffic around Times Square barely moves, and the nearest subway entrance with working escalators was two blocks away, which isn’t great when you’re in heels and it’s drizzling. After the performance, it took another 20 minutes to flag a ride back, and the late-night street noise around the hotel made the walk feel longer than it should.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing on the staff experience: I arrived close to midnight after a delayed flight, and there was a line of eight people with only one person working the front desk. No one acknowledged the queue for about 10 minutes, and when I finally got up there and requested foam pillows due to allergies, I was told housekeeping was “done for the night.” I called again in the morning and had to follow up twice before anything was delivered, and the bell staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other than helping guests with luggage.",
        "source_3": "Just commenting on the bathroom and shower in my room (1912): the rainfall shower looked sleek, but the water pressure pulsed from strong to weak every 30 seconds. The temperature fluctuated so much that I kept having to step out mid-shampoo, and the drain was slow enough that water pooled to ankle height after a couple of minutes. The towel hook by the vanity was loose and fell off when I hung a bath sheet, which isn’t ideal when you’re trying to get ready for a morning meeting.",
        "source_4": "I paid extra for a “city view” and ended up staring into an airshaft with a sliver of sky and a wall of HVAC units across the way. There was scaffolding on the building next door, so half the window was blocked by netting, and the skyline photos on the booking page didn’t match what I could actually see unless I pressed my face right up against the glass and craned left. I asked to switch rooms and was told the property was fully booked, so I stuck with a view that felt more like a light well than the city.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression after a one-night stay booked at $180 on Priceline: check-in was quick for me mid-afternoon, and the front desk person answered questions about nearby theaters without sounding rushed. The lobby has a fun, modern look, and I liked grabbing a coffee by the bar before heading out. My room wasn’t huge, but the queen mattress and desk setup worked fine for emails, and the bathroom finishes looked new. I had a clear view of the lights downtown, which made winding down after the show pretty relaxing. I’d book here again for a short trip focused on seeing plays.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture take after a weekend stay: the lobby feels like a club at night, which made meeting colleagues awkward over the thumping soundtrack, and the check-in line on Friday around 6 p.m. wrapped toward the elevators. My queen room felt tight; opening a large suitcase on the floor meant stepping over it to get to the bathroom, and the AC cycled loudly in short bursts. The shower drained slowly, and my window looked onto a brick wall and some vents, so I kept the blinds closed. The location works if all you’re doing is theater, but between the crowded common areas and the compact room, I’ll pick a different hotel next time."
