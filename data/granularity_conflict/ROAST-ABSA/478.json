        "source_1": "I took the Plato course after years of bouncing off the Republic, and Professor Holbo finally made the structure make sense. The Week 2 lecture on the ring of Gyges had a clear step‑by‑step breakdown of the argument, and the diagram on the slide actually matched the way the quiz framed it later. I kept pausing to copy his examples into a notebook, especially the part where he contrasted Book I’s back‑and‑forth with the more architectural build in Books II–IV. The final reflection asked me to connect the Cave to a contemporary example; I used social media curation, and the rubric rewarded precise citations, not just generalities. I finished the course wanting to re‑read Book VII, which is a first for me.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on captions and transcripts: the auto‑generated English subtitles made note‑taking rough. In Week 3, Lecture 2, “thumos” repeatedly appeared as “Thomas,” and “dianoia” showed up as “dianosia.” The timing started to drift about 12 minutes in, so the captioned definition of “eikasia” landed after the slide had already changed. The downloadable transcript for Week 4 had “Form of the Good” lowercased in one place and capitalized in another, which muddled my highlights. As someone studying in a noisy apartment, I rely on accurate captions, and I ended up rewatching segments just to confirm terms.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on peer grading: the second essay on the Allegory of the Cave uses a 10‑point rubric (Thesis 3, Evidence 3, Counterargument 2, Mechanics 2). Two of my three reviewers left one‑line comments like “too long,” even though the prompt allowed 800–1000 words and mine was 930. One person deducted for “no counterargument” despite the paragraph labeled as such and the rubric checkbox ticked. I appealed and got staff moderation, but the turnaround took six days, which pushed me into the late window for the next assignment. When the course leans on peer review, inconsistent application of the rubric has real consequences for pacing.",
        "source_4": "Overall impression from a working student: the workload felt stacked. In four weeks we covered Republic I–VII plus a chunk of Book X, with recommended readings from Julia Annas and a Stanford Encyclopedia entry. Video segments averaged 18 minutes, and there were nine to ten per week, so keeping up after a full‑time shift meant late nights. Quizzes allowed only one attempt, and a couple of questions used double negatives (“Which is NOT inconsistent with…?”) that sent me back to rewatch. The forum threads moved fast; by the time I posted on the “Noble Lie” prompt, the instructor’s earlier replies were buried under hundreds of comments, and I didn’t see follow‑ups on later weeks.",
        "source_5": "Concentrating on discussion forums only: the weekly prompts were specific enough to spark genuine exchange. In Week 1, “What exactly is Cephalus defending?” led to a thread where a TA asked me to cite line numbers, and I got a reply within 12 hours. The upvote system helped surface well‑argued posts, and the pinned “misconceptions” summary after Week 2 kept debates from looping. The course team hosted a live office hour on Zoom in Week 5; I asked about the Divided Line and got a time‑stamped follow‑up post with references to the lecture slides. A small study group spun up from the forum, and we met independently to read Book X together."
