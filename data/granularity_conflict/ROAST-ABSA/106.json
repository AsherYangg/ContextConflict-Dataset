        "source_1": "I signed up for the 8‑week course with the intent to stick to two hours each Sunday. By week 4 I was bumping up against 4–5 hours because the lectures skimmed terms and then the assignments jumped into problems that assumed more background. The first two weeks felt breezy, but the middle section piled on readings and longer quizzes. I ended up skipping parts just to keep pace, which left me with scattered notes and not much I could apply at work.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on workload and pace: with a strict two‑hours‑per‑week cap, Week 2 had about 65 minutes of video, but Week 3 added a 25‑question quiz that referenced long PDFs. Between pausing lectures to take notes and opening the papers, my stopwatch hit 3.5 hours. I had to rewind several segments because the explanations moved quickly through formulas.",
        "source_3": "Strictly on breadth for time invested: I used one evening (about 90 minutes) to get a tour of A/B testing pitfalls, causal language, and basic power calculations. The reading list pointed to specific chapters rather than dumping a huge bibliography, which made it easy to decide what to pursue next. For the time spent, the coverage felt broad enough to steer my learning plan.",
        "source_4": "As a full‑time master’s student, I wanted a survey to tie together topics from different seminars. I watched at 1.25× speed, spent roughly two hours per week including the quiz, and kept a running sheet of the instructor’s checklists. The industry examples (ad ranking, experimentation rollouts) helped me connect theory to projects, and I reused the pre‑launch checklist in my class capstone with good results.",
        "source_5": "Only on knowledge conveyed per minute: I blocked two hours weekly, and about the first 40 minutes were recap slides and repeated definitions. Quizzes echoed wording from the lectures rather than pushing into new ground. The fresh material each week could have fit into a short article, so the return on my time felt thin.",
        "source_6": "Only on workload fit: each module took me about 90 minutes—roughly an hour of video, a short quiz, and a quick forum check‑in. No heavy assignments and no required papers, so it slotted neatly into a lunch break plus one evening without crowding out other commitments."
