        "source_1": "I stayed three nights to catch two Broadway shows and the hotel worked well for me overall: check-in took about five minutes, the staff at the front desk used my name when handing over the keys, and my Executive double-double (room 1205) had a view over 8th Ave with enough distance from the street to sleep without waking up. The room felt recently refreshed—newer carpet, a bathroom with subway tile and good water pressure—and it was big enough for two suitcases to stay open without blocking the walkway. I paid $219 per night before tax, which felt fair for the area, and the A/C/E and 1 lines were each a short walk away, plus plenty of quick dinner options on 9th Ave.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on location: I was in town for back-to-back evening shows, and this spot made it easy—four minutes to the TKTS steps, under ten to most theaters on 45th–47th Streets, and Port Authority right there for the airport bus. The tradeoff is late-night street activity; around midnight the bar crowds and sirens ramped up, so I needed earplugs even on the 10th floor. For daytime sightseeing and quick subway access, though, the placement is extremely convenient.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on cleanliness: upon arrival I ran a wipe over the headboard and it came up gray, the bathroom grout in the shower had a patch of mildew by the corner shelf, and there were crumbs behind the accent chair. Housekeeping came back when I called and took care of most of it, but the vent above the entry still had dust by checkout. If spotless surfaces are a priority, you may want to do a quick walk-through before unpacking.",
        "source_4": "Only about price/fees: my nightly rate showed as $199 when booking, but the final bill included a $35 destination fee, plus tax on top of that. Wi‑Fi at the higher speed tier ran $15 per day, a bottle of water in the room was $10, and self-parking in the nearby garage was $65 for 24 hours. Breakfast wasn’t included, so two coffees and a croissant from the lobby kiosk added another $18. My total for a single night crossed $300 once everything stacked up.",
        "source_5": "Overall take from a weekend stay: room 807 faced an interior shaft with a brick wall a few feet away, and the double-double setup felt tight once two carry-ons and a garment bag were in the mix. The AC unit clicked and rattled on and off through the night, and while the furniture looked recently updated, I noticed paint specks on the bathroom floor and a peeling edge on the vanity. I called down for extra towels twice; they arrived about 40 minutes later. The location helped for theater plans, but the room itself didn’t live up to what I expected from the photos.",
        "source_6": "Singular focus on room layout/features: I booked the Executive double-double and appreciated the practical touches—USB outlets on both nightstands, blackout shades that sealed the light gap, a walk-in shower with a stable temperature, and a desk deep enough for my 16-inch laptop. Two people could move around without bumping into each other, and the closet held both roller bags plus coats. Linens smelled fresh, and the mattress felt supportive without sagging toward the middle."
