        "source_1": "I booked a standard king and cared mostly about the room itself. Mine on the 5th floor had enough space to open two suitcases at once, a wide work desk with plenty of outlets, and a luggage bench that kept things off the floor. The bathroom grout was bright and the glass had no streaks, towels smelled fresh, and there wasn’t dust on the vents or lampshades. AC held 20°C without rattling, and the blackout curtains actually kept the streetlights out. I barely heard any hallway noise, which made it easy to wind down after late meetings.",
        "source_2": "My experience was all about the people at the front desk and housekeeping. I arrived close to midnight, and Alina at reception offered bottled water, set up a 6:00 a.m. wake-up, and printed a last-minute contract I needed for a morning pitch. When my charger died, the concierge dug up a spare USB‑C cable and wouldn’t take a deposit. Housekeeping noticed I was running before sunrise and left extra towels without me asking. They also called a cab during a downpour and tracked it on their screen so I didn’t miss my train.",
        "source_3": "I chose this place for a client nearby, but the immediate area felt dull once offices closed. After 6 p.m., most storefronts rolled down their shutters, and the only open option within a five-minute walk was a small kebab counter. It’s a 12–15 minute walk to the metro, and the tram stop is a bit farther. There’s no park or riverside to stroll, no galleries or cafés to linger in—just empty sidewalks and glassy office blocks. I ended up eating takeaway in my room two nights in a row.",
        "source_4": "I stayed two nights and the overall vibe was dull. The lobby has a plain, corporate look, and the lounge was quiet enough that you could hear the elevator chime. My room was big and clean, the shower water pressure steady, and the Wi‑Fi handled video calls. The rate was €89 a night and included coffee at breakfast, and the staff greeted me every time I passed the desk. Still, there wasn’t anything that made me want to linger—no buzz at the bar, nothing to get excited about—just a place to sleep between meetings.",
        "source_5": "For a week-long training, this worked well for my budget. I prepaid and saved a chunk compared to downtown, and the room had enough floor space for a quick yoga session each morning. Housekeeping kept the desk clear and swapped out linens without me needing to leave notes. The front desk team remembered my name and sorted a late checkout so I could shower after the final session. Wi‑Fi stayed steady for Teams all week, and the hallways were quiet at night. I’d book the same place again for future business trips, even if the neighborhood isn’t exactly a destination."
