        "source_1": "I’m only gauging the dark chocolate pieces here. I live in Minneapolis, and the bag sat in a cool pantry for a week. The chunks stayed distinct—no melting—though a few had that pale bloom you see on chocolate that’s been chilled. The flavor leaned toward cocoa nibs rather than candy bar, with a dry snap that broke into the granola instead of smearing. I actually preferred nibbling the chocolate bits straight out of the mix, but in a heated bowl (I warmed the granola with warm milk once), the pieces softened and acted like glue, causing a couple of big clusters. If you want pronounced chocolate pockets, room-temperature storage in a cooler climate seems to keep them intact.",
        "source_2": "My notes are strictly on the sweetness. I’m sensitive to added sugars, and this tasted more like a light, earthy sweetness than a dessert-level dose. It reads to me like coconut sugar or honey—no sharp cane bite and no syrupy film on the tongue. With plain Greek yogurt, the sweetness felt muted, so I added half a teaspoon of maple to wake it up. Oddly, when I ate it dry as a desk snack, it seemed sweeter, maybe because the chocolate wasn’t diluted by dairy. There’s no lingering saccharine aftertaste, which I appreciated, but if you’re expecting candy-level sweetness, you might end up augmenting it.",
        "source_3": "Speaking broadly about the whole bag: I used it for weekday breakfasts with almond milk. The clusters ranged from pebbly bits to a couple of thumb-sized chunks, and it stayed crunchy for a good five minutes before softening. The chocolate shows up as a cocoa whisper rather than big bites, and I kept thinking a handful of nuts or dried cherries would round it out. The zip-top reseal was finicky; I had to use a clip to actually keep air out after day two. One cup kept me going until mid-morning, but I didn’t get much variety per serving—lots of oats, fewer mix-ins. I might try another bag in cooler weather to see if the chocolate holds its shape better.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on texture performance: I tested it three ways—plain, in milk, and mixed into yogurt. Dry, the clusters have a brittle crunch that’s easy to chew without jaw fatigue. In cold milk, the small bits lost structure quickly and turned into a sandy layer at the bottom of the bowl, while the larger clusters held up. In yogurt, the granola absorbed moisture fast and became paste-like within two minutes, which didn’t give me the contrast I look for. The bottom quarter of the bag had quite a bit of oat dust, which thickened the yogurt but made spoonfuls feel gritty. If you like a persistent crunch in wet applications, this might require quick eating.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after a summer shipment to Tampa: The bag arrived warm, and the chocolate had fused into ribbons through the oats, so every scoop had a chocolate smear rather than discrete chips. That actually worked well stirred into vanilla yogurt—kind of a built-in swirl. Eaten straight, it leaned roasty with a hint of salt, and the sweetness didn’t crowd out the cocoa. The resealable strip clicked shut reliably, and I didn’t notice staling over a week. My kids liked it as a snack mix with banana chips added, but when I tried it as cereal, the chocolate dissolved fast and colored the milk. If you want chunk integrity, order when temps are lower; if you prefer even chocolate distribution, the summer melt does that for you."
