        "source_1": "I finished the course over two weeks while working as an ADA coordinator at a community college. The syllabus was laid out by Title I, II, and III, with a separate unit on Section 504 and IDEA. The instructor walked through Olmstead v. L.C. and Fry v. Napoleon with timelines and practical takeaways, then gave downloadable checklists for the interactive process and undue burden analysis. I used the sample accommodation request form from Week 1 at work the next day, and the peer forum helped me compare how others document essential functions. The pacing let me watch at 1.25x with transcripts open, and the final assessment mapped cleanly to the terms emphasized in the lectures.",
        "source_2": "I relied on captions and transcripts, so I focused on that part. In Week 2, the captions repeatedly turned “Section 504” into “section 5:04,” and “IDEA” into “idea,” which changes the meaning when you’re trying to memorize terms. “Undue burden” showed up as “undue bourbon” more than once, and the timestamps were off by a few seconds, so the text didn’t match the audio when the instructor read case names. I filed a ticket and got a polite response, but the Week 3 videos still had the same drift. I ended up pausing every 10–15 seconds to piece together the correct phrasing from the transcript.",
        "source_3": "I only needed clarity on one narrow point: drawing the line between a reasonable accommodation and a fundamental alteration in higher education. The module on postsecondary settings gave a decision tree (request → documentation → interactive process → determination → appeal) and showed anonymized email examples between a disability office and faculty. The chart comparing extended time on exams vs. altering learning outcomes finally clicked for me, and the case snippet on testing with assistive tech included the exact CFR citations. I barely touched the other modules because this single section answered the policy questions I face each week.",
        "source_4": "I dropped the course midway through Week 2 because the overall delivery wasn’t what I expected. Several links in the readings led to archived DOJ pages from 2010–2015, and a PDF on service animals didn’t mention the miniature horse guidance that’s been standard for years. The instructor mostly read bullet points, the discussion board had unanswered questions sitting for months, and two of the external articles threw 404 errors. I was hoping for updates on web accessibility enforcement and recent settlements, but those topics were either brief or missing, so I moved on.",
        "source_5": "My experience centered on the quizzes. The Week 3 quiz used confusing wording, like “It is not unreasonable to not provide…” which made double negatives part of the challenge. A question about Olmstead accepted only “community integration mandate,” but rejected “least restrictive setting,” even though the lecture used both phrases. The same item appeared twice with slightly different phrasing, and the results page didn’t flag which options were wrong, just the overall score. With only two graded attempts, I couldn’t learn from mistakes before the next try, so the grade felt opaque rather than a check on what I learned."
