        "source_1": "I finished the course over two weekends and loved the format: 8–12 minute videos that each tackled one idea, then pointed me to readings so I could chase threads on my own. The instructor stripped down dense economic models into plain language, then layered back the math and legal context with simple sketches and examples (I still remember the carbon tax whiteboard). The weekly prompts nudged me into the forums, where I compared policy approaches across states and countries. The short segments actually freed up time for me to dig into the linked reports, and by the capstone I had a one-page memo connecting externalities, administrative law, and climate litigation that I could share at work.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on lecture length and pacing. The videos are chopped into very small bites—some weeks felt like 20 clips that ran 5–7 minutes each. Several examples start in one clip and finish two clips later, and I kept losing the thread (the carbon pricing example in Week 3 is split awkwardly). I would have preferred fewer cuts and more time per video—15–20 minutes to see a full argument unfold without jumping between segments. The frequent intros/outros and the platform’s auto-play stingers made it feel more fragmented than it needed to be.",
        "source_3": "Just commenting on the materials: the slide PDFs are mostly bullet lists with sparse citations, and a few charts are so low-res that the axes blur on a laptop, let alone a phone. Two of the Week 2 links (the policy brief and the journal op-ed) led to 404 pages, and the suggested “dataset for further exploration” in Week 4 had been moved. I ended up spending extra time hunting down sources that should have been packaged with the course. If you rely on handouts to review instead of rewatching videos, this setup is inconvenient.",
        "source_4": "I enrolled for the topic, but I kept showing up for the instructor. He has that rare classroom presence even through a webcam—steady eye contact, clean pacing, and a habit of turning abstract ideas into little stories. In one lecture he used a neighborhood parking dilemma to illustrate externalities and then sketched a two-axis diagram from memory; I didn’t need to hit rewind. He’s concise without sounding rushed, and he pauses to define acronyms before moving on. I’d watch this person explain almost anything.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression: the syllabus promises a bridge between law, policy, and economics, but the path felt choppy. Week 1 dives into Coase and transaction costs, then we leap to treaty frameworks with few transitions, and the quizzes sometimes use double negatives that make the questions more about parsing grammar than testing understanding. The discussion forums in my session were dominated by a couple of posters, with little guidance to tie threads back to the core themes. The instructor is engaging on camera, but by the end I had a stack of notes rather than a coherent framework I could apply at work."
