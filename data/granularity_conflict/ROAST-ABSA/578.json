        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly to polish my Korean grammar, but the grammar segments feel like rule lists with few spoken examples. The instructor drops terms like “batchim” and moves on before showing how they sound in a sentence. I kept pausing and rewinding the irregular verbs lecture because the examples were scattered across different slides. The quizzes at the end asked about particles we hadn’t touched in that video, so I ended up rewatching sections and making my own summary chart just to get through that unit.",
        "source_2": "As a working parent, I followed the recommended four‑week plan and stuck to two videos a day. The structure helped: 8–12 minute lessons, end‑of‑module review sheets, and downloadable Hangul charts. The weekly peer assignment where we record greetings nudged me to actually speak, and by the third week I was introducing myself and asking for prices at a local Korean market. The only snag was occasional audio clipping in the instructor’s mic during live demos, but the content flow kept me on track.",
        "source_3": "I signed up to see if I could follow the instructor’s explanations, and that’s where I struggled. Her slide text is small on a laptop, and she switches tabs mid‑sentence, so the cursor jumps and I lose my place. The subtitles lag by a second or two, which makes consonant rules hard to catch in real time. In the particles lesson, she moved between 은/는 and 이/가 without a fixed framework, and I had to pause to draw my own table to keep the distinctions straight.",
        "source_4": "I completed every quiz and the final project. The platform graded instantly and the discussion board had active learners who responded within a day. I got comfortable reading menu items in Hangul, which felt like a concrete win, but most practice activities are fill‑in‑the‑blank rather than open conversation. After finishing, I could handle set phrases, yet I wanted more role‑play dialogues to carry those grammar points into spontaneous speaking.",
        "source_5": "I took this specifically for grammar breakdowns, and the instructor’s method clicked for me. She color‑codes verb stems and endings (blue for stems, green for endings), and she lines up irregulars—ㅅ, ㅂ, 르—with examples like 짓다→지어요 and 돕다→도와요. The progression from plain present to polite form made sense, and I could follow without rewinding. I printed the PDF summaries and used them to check my conjugations while messaging friends in Korean."
