        "source_1": "I picked this place purely for the location and used it as a base for a weekend of shopping. From the lobby it was a 6–7 minute walk to the main retail strip, and I could wander to the museums and riverfront in under 15. At dinner time I headed down Stanley St and had no trouble finding a table at an Italian spot and, the next night, a Thai place two doors down. The bus stop to the gallery precinct was across the block, so I barely opened a rideshare app.",
        "source_2": "I’m fussy about room cleanliness, so here’s just that: my room looked tidy at first glance, but I found dust on the bedside lampshade and a faint coffee ring on the desk. The shower stall had two stray hairs in the corner on day one, and housekeeping missed replacing the hand towel on day three. Nothing catastrophic, but it didn’t feel meticulously turned over between days.",
        "source_3": "I interacted with the staff more than I expected because I kept asking for local tips. Maya at the front desk circled a walking route on a paper map, pointed me to a bakery for early-morning coffee, and even called ahead to check a table at a spot on Stanley St. Housekeeping greeted me in the hallway each afternoon and offered extra bottled water without me asking, which made coming back from meetings feel easy.",
        "source_4": "Five nights here for a city break: check-in was smooth, my room was quiet on the 8th floor, and the bed held up fine after long days. I walked to the botanical gardens in the morning, grabbed lunch near the shopping arcades, and never needed a taxi for the usual sights. Restaurants down Stanley St made dinners effortless. Between the helpful reception team and the consistent room refresh each day, I’d book the same place again.",
        "source_5": "I stayed three nights for work and, while the address looks central on the map, it wasn’t ideal for my schedule. Coming from the train with a suitcase meant a 12–15 minute uphill walk and two busy crossings. My room faced a lively stretch near Stanley St; the late-night chatter and delivery trucks made it hard to wind down before early meetings. Elevators were slow at 8 a.m., and the lobby felt jammed with tour groups, so getting out the door took longer than I’d like. If I were back for business, I’d pick somewhere a bit calmer."
