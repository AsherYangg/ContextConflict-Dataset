        "source_1": "I chose this hotel because I didn’t want to mess with cabs. From the lobby to the central station took me 6 minutes on foot with a roller bag. The airport bus stops right across the street, and there’s a supermarket and a 24-hour pharmacy next door. I caught a late show at the playhouse and walked back at midnight without feeling isolated. If you’re planning museums and the river walk, everything lined up within a 10–12 minute radius.",
        "source_2": "For a conference at the expo hall, the location turned into a hassle. Maps said it was a quick walk, but the pedestrian bridge over the canal is closed for construction, so the detour made it over 25 minutes each way. Morning coffee options nearby open late on weekends, and several places shut by 8 p.m. I ended up spending more on rideshares than expected just to keep on schedule.",
        "source_3": "I book hotels partly for the interiors, and my fifth-floor corner room felt thoughtfully put together. Floor-to-ceiling windows faced south, pale oak furniture and white linens kept the space light, and the dimmable LEDs let me set the tone for work vs. winding down. The photos on the site matched what I saw, right down to the textured headboard and the minimalist desk without clutter. Not a single gloomy corner, even on a rainy afternoon.",
        "source_4": "As a light sleeper, I came prepared with earplugs and a white-noise app, and didn’t end up using either. Third floor, room 315, courtyard side: no street bleed, no hallway chatter, and the HVAC was a soft hum. The neighbor ran their shower at 6 a.m. and I barely noticed it; the plumbing didn’t howl. If you worry about noise, ask for the inner wing.",
        "source_5": "Check-in at 2:45 p.m. turned into a 40-minute queue, and the front desk agent barely made eye contact when it was my turn. I asked for a quiet room and an extra pillow; the room faced the elevator and the pillow never showed up. Housekeeping skipped our floor on day two, and when I called, the operator transferred me twice before anyone owned the request. I also asked the concierge to book a taxi for 5:30 a.m., and nothing was scheduled when I came down.",
        "source_6": "Five-night business trip, and the stay ran smoothly from start to finish. Room 712 had a wide window with a city view and plenty of daylight, the bed was supportive, and I slept through every night despite a full hotel. The team at the desk handled a billing tweak in two minutes, and the café downstairs became my morning routine. With the tram one block over, I could bounce between client sites quickly. I’d put this on my shortlist for future visits."
