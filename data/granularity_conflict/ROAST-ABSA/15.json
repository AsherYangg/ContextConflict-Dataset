        "source_1": "I booked this place mainly for where it sits in the city. From the lobby to the CN Tower took me about 11 minutes at an easy pace, and Rogers Centre was another few blocks. There’s a streetcar stop half a block away, which made getting to the waterfront simple. Coming back after dark felt busy but orderly, with lots of people around and well-lit corners. If your plan is to walk between major sights and skip rideshares, the location makes that straightforward.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on the breakfast because that’s what matters to me on quick business trips. It’s included, but by 8:15 a.m. the hot items were low, and the staff were hustling to refill trays. The pastries leaned sugary, fruit was mostly melon, and the coffee tasted thin to me. Seating filled up, so a few of us ended up balancing plates in the lobby chairs. It did the job, but if you’re counting on something hearty without a wait, you might want a nearby café as a backup.",
        "source_3": "Stayed one night with my partner and our daughter in a one-bedroom suite. The separate lounge let us put her to bed on the sofa while we talked in the other room, and the small kitchen handled snacks and a late-night tea. We walked to the CN Tower in under 15 minutes and grabbed photos before dinner. Morning breakfast downstairs got us moving without hunting for a restaurant, and checkout was quick enough that we made our train with time to spare. For a short family stopover, it fit what we needed.",
        "source_4": "We chose the suite specifically for the kitchenette, and I used it for two evening meals. The cooktop is a two-burner unit that struggles to hold a large pan and a pot at the same time, and there wasn’t a frying pan in the cabinet—just a small saucepan and a stockpot. Utensils were a mixed set, so I ended up flipping pancakes with a spoon, and there was no dish soap or scrubber provided. The mini-fridge kept milk cold, but it hummed loud enough that I turned it down at night. If you plan to cook more than simple reheats, bring a few basics.",
        "source_5": "Weekend stay for a concert trip. Check-in moved quickly, but the elevators backed up around dinner time and again in the morning, with waits of several minutes. Our suite had plenty of floor space, though the sofa bed mattress felt thin and the AC unit cycled with a noticeable buzz. Street noise carried up on Saturday night, and hallway chatter was easy to hear until close to midnight. The walk to the stadium and tower is short, which helped our schedule, but the overall feel was more hectic than we hoped for a one-night rest."
