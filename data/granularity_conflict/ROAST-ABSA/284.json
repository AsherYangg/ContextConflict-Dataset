        "source_1": "I bought this for my mom, who kept complaining about tiny text on her old handset. During setup I went to Settings > Display > Font size and also tweaked Accessibility > Display size; between the two, her chats and dialer are finally legible without squinting. I pinned a large clock widget and switched to 3‑button navigation so she wouldn’t get lost in gestures. The screen glides through Chrome and YouTube without hiccups, and she can bump the text up or down in a couple of taps from the quick settings tile I added.",
        "source_2": "I’m picky about screens, and this panel hasn’t impressed me. Whites shift a little yellow when the phone is tilted, and outdoors I have to slam brightness to max just to read a message. Scrolling through Twitter shows small stutters, and opening the camera drops frames on the home animation. Side by side with my older device, colors look flatter unless I punch up saturation, which then makes skin tones look odd.",
        "source_3": "I bought it for my dad solely to enlarge text, and the path to do that isn’t straightforward. Font size and Display size live in different menus, the quick toggle wasn’t enabled by default, and it took a good 15 minutes to find everything. Even after maxing both, our banking app and the calendar keep tiny headers, and notification previews don’t scale much. The keyboard balloons up while the dialer digits barely change, so the result feels inconsistent.",
        "source_4": "Used it as my main phone for a week. The screen scrolls cleanly, and bumping up text took me under a minute once I dropped a shortcut tile into the quick panel. Calls on my end sounded a bit muffled, the bottom speaker buzzed at higher volume, and I was looking for a charger by late afternoon. Between that and a couple of app freezes on day three, I packed it back in the box.",
        "source_5": "I read a lot on my commute, so I pay attention to display quality. Small serif fonts in Kindle look crisp with no fuzzy edges, and grayscale comics render without banding. Scrolling in long articles feels steady, and switching the color mode to Natural gives more comfortable tones for nighttime. Auto‑brightness adjusts smoothly when I step from the train platform into a dim carriage, without that jarring jump."
