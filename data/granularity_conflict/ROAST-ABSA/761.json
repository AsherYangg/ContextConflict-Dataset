        "source_1": "I sent a box to my grandkids (4 and 6), and it’s turned into their after‑school routine. They split a pouch in the car on the way home from swim lessons, and I like that it doesn’t crumble all over the booster seats. Our next‑door neighbors tried one during a playdate and asked if I had extras to take home. My only hiccup is portioning for the youngest; I end up pouring a little into a cup and sealing the rest so it doesn’t become a full dinner substitute.",
        "source_2": "I bought these because the listing leaned hard on the “better‑for‑you” angle, but when I checked the label it showed 11g of sugar per serving, with fruit concentrate listed near the top. That might be fine for occasional treats, but for a daily lunchbox item I’m looking for something closer to 5–6g and more fiber. My 8‑year‑old enjoys the taste, so I’m not pulling it entirely, just rationing to weekends and pairing with string cheese instead of sending it solo.",
        "source_3": "My feedback is strictly about packaging size. We used to get the small 1/2‑ounce bags for preschool, which were perfect for tiny appetites. The current packs feel oversized for 3–4‑year‑olds; my daughter eats a third, and the rest goes stale unless I clip it right away. For classroom snack bins, the bigger bags also crowd the container, and teachers prefer the mini packs so every kid gets a similar amount.",
        "source_4": "Texture wise, these are a mixed bag for little mouths. My 3‑year‑old had trouble with the thicker pieces—some clump together and take effort to chew—while my 7‑year‑old breezes through them. I now cut the larger chunks with kitchen shears and keep water handy. Once I break them up, they’re fine, but it’s an extra step I didn’t expect for something marketed to younger kids.",
        "source_5": "As an overall impression after two orders: the first box tasted fresh, and my kids kept asking for it; the second box arrived with several pouches puffed and the contents a bit tough, like it had sat in a warm warehouse. The neighbor’s child took one bite and passed. I contacted the seller for a replacement and will try one more time, but consistency from shipment to shipment matters when you’re buying in bulk.",
        "source_6": "I coach a U6 soccer team, and these have become our go‑to sideline snack. The portion gives the kids enough fuel to finish practice without asking for extra crackers, and the teachers at my son’s school have no issue with me sending a pack on early‑release days. They fit in the front pocket of a backpack, and we haven’t had leaks or sticky fingers if we remind the kids to close the pouch when they’re done."
