        "source_1": "I finished the entire course in three evenings. Most lessons felt like someone reading off lists of topics with extended English commentary. Module 3 (“Shopping Phrases”) was fifteen minutes of explaining how to pronounce each item in English, then a multiple-choice quiz. There were no role-play tasks where I had to respond in the target language under time pressure, and the “Practice: Market Chat” turned out to be fill‑in‑the‑blank sentences instead of a dialogue. The quizzes flagged wrong answers but didn’t tell me whether it was a missing accent or a word order issue. After about 90 minutes, I had memorized a handful of set phrases, but I never saw them used in a back‑and‑forth conversation.",
        "source_2": "I only used the dialogue tracks, skipping the grammar lectures. Starting in Module 2, there are short scenes like “At the Café” and “Asking for Directions” with two native speakers trading lines at normal speed, then slowed down. Each segment includes a “repeat after me” loop and a final role-play where you fill the missing lines while the other speaker continues. I replayed “At the Train Station” five times and could shadow the ticket‑agent exchange by the end. For someone wanting situational phrases, these scripted dialogues were the most valuable part.",
        "source_3": "I spent my time in the exercises because I learn by correcting mistakes. The auto‑checker gives pretty granular feedback: it highlights the exact token in red, says “accent missing on número,” and suggests “use preterite here: fui” if you typed the present tense. On free‑response items, it shows a sample solution and underlines mismatched gender or agreement. I appreciated the little pop‑ups that explain why “por” vs “para” was expected, and the end‑of‑module review summarizes the patterns I missed.",
        "source_4": "I treated the course like a travel refresher. I did 20–25 minutes each morning, downloaded the audio so I could practice on the bus, and kept a checklist of phrases from the “Hotels” and “Restaurants” sections. The English explanations were short enough for me to skim, and the drills let me rehearse “Una mesa para dos” and “Dónde está el baño” until I could say them without peeking. It doesn’t dive deep into grammar, but I used the phrase lists on a weekend trip and felt prepared for ordering, asking directions, and small talk with shopkeepers.",
        "source_5": "I focused on the graded assignments and ran into ultra‑strict scoring. The system counted “adiós” wrong unless I included the accent, marked my answer off for writing “camarero” instead of “mesero” even though the prompt didn’t specify a region, and failed sentences with a trailing period when the expected string had none. On synonym tasks, “boleto” and “ticket” were treated as different despite the lesson covering both. I often spent more time matching the platform’s exact phrasing than practicing the language.",
        "source_6": "I mainly struggled with instructions. One activity said “translate loosely,” but the rubric penalized anything that wasn’t a literal copy of the sample answer. Another told me to “use at least three new words from the list” without clarifying whether cognates counted, and the final project mentioned a “dialogue” without specifying length or format. The course rarely summarized what you missed; I finished a unit not knowing whether my errors were pronunciation, accent marks, or grammar, because the feedback just said “incorrect” and moved on."
