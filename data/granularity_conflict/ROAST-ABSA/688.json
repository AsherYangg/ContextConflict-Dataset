        "source_1": "After the phone kept dropping out on SIM 1, I booked an appointment via the brand’s app. I walked into the MG Road service center at 11:30 a.m., took token A47, and the technician ran diagnostics that pointed to the baseband chip. They had the motherboard in stock, swapped it the same day, and asked me to return at 5 p.m. I got status SMS updates, and they moved my data to a loaner while the board was replaced. I left without paying anything under the 12‑month coverage, and my calls worked again.",
        "source_2": "I mainly bought it to juggle Slack, Gmail, Duo video calls, and Maps while commuting. With 8 GB RAM and the 120 Hz setting enabled, I can jump between five apps with picture‑in‑picture running, and there’s no delay opening the camera from the lock screen. I recorded a 4K clip and shared it while streaming Spotify, and the UI stayed responsive. Gaming for 45 minutes in Asphalt raised the temperature to around 40–41°C, but frames stayed consistent and touch input didn’t hitch.",
        "source_3": "Nine months in, the phone started rebooting during calls and the signal icon would vanish for minutes at a time. I live outside the city, so the nearest authorized center is a 70 km drive; I had to take a day off, wait two hours, and they replaced the main board under warranty. For a while it behaved, then in the twelfth month the drops returned along with random ghost touches. I’ve now moved my SIM to an older device because I can’t rely on this one for work calls.",
        "source_4": "I’m on dual SIM (Jio + Airtel) and use it primarily for calls and Wi‑Fi hot‑spotting. Over 14 months I haven’t seen a single baseband crash or “No Service” banner. Even on weak coverage, it latches onto VoLTE without bouncing, and handoffs between 4G and 5G are smooth in the metro tunnels. I track signal with NetMonster; average RSRP around −95 dBm and stable throughput during Teams calls.",
        "source_5": "I set it up alongside my old handset and migrated 128 GB of data with the brand’s transfer tool. The camera app opens quickly, battery gives me a full workday (9 a.m.–11 p.m.) with two SIMs, a Bluetooth watch, and hotspot for my laptop in the afternoon. I stream cricket on Hotstar during breaks and answer WhatsApp video calls while navigating in Google Maps. Software updates landed roughly every quarter, and a chat agent helped me figure out a settings toggle for call recording.",
        "source_6": "When the network chip failed at month ten, I tried calling the helpline and got bounced between IVR menus; the live agent kept asking me to reboot and reset network settings even after I sent a video of the issue. The website said parts were back‑ordered, and the only service desk in my city stopped accepting walk‑ins after 3 p.m. I eventually shipped the phone at my own expense, and it sat in “Received” status for twelve days with no update."
