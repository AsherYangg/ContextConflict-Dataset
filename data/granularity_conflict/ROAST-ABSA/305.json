        "source_1": "I keep a box of these 100-calorie peanut butter snacks in my desk and another at home. The peanut aroma hits as soon as I open a bag, and the taste stands out enough that I don’t go hunting for something else afterward. My son asks for a pack in his lunch, and one bag usually carries me through the 3 p.m. slump without needing a second. For what it is, each bag feels reasonably full; I’ve pulled 18–20 little bites from most of them.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on quantity: the bags look puffed up, but once I pour them out, I’m staring at a small handful. I counted 11 pieces in one, 13 in another, and the rest was clearly air space. On my kitchen scale they varied between 16–18 grams, which vanishes in a couple minutes and doesn’t match what the packaging size suggests at a glance.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on flavor: I bake with peanut butter weekly, and this doesn’t deliver the depth I expect. It smells nutty when I open it, but the bite leans sugary and finishes with a slightly synthetic note. I did a quick blind taste with my partner, and the guess was “sweet cereal,” not peanut butter, which says a lot about how muted the nut taste comes through.",
        "source_4": "After finishing a full box over two weeks, I’m not grabbing these anymore. The pieces are dry and a bit sandy, and they stick to my molars so I end up drinking a full glass of water with each bag. I tried offering one to my son during a movie night; he chewed two bits and pushed the bag back. By the last few packs, I was picking through the smaller pieces just to get through them.",
        "source_5": "Strictly about portion per bag: my scale shows 21–22 grams consistently, and I usually count around 17 small bites. It’s a 100-calorie pack that actually gets me from lunch to a late afternoon meeting without opening a second snack, which surprised me given the size of the bag. I toss one in my purse and it tides me over on errands."
