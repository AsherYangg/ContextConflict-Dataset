        "source_1": "I bought this to tone down my sweet blends. On its own with 10–12 oz of water, it comes across almost like unsweetened milk with a whisper of vanilla. The scoop I have lists around 110 calories and 22g of protein, and the texture is pretty thin. My routine now is one scoop of this plus half a scoop of Vega Berry when I want something drinkable after the gym without pushing calories too high. If I’m craving a milkshake-style shake, I reach for a different tub.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on sweetness: this barely moves the needle. I’m sensitive to sucralose and stevia, so I tested it in plain water at work—1 scoop in 12 oz, shaken in a BlenderBottle. The taste sits in the background and doesn’t coat the tongue. If I want a sweet shake, I have to add half a banana or a splash of vanilla oat milk; otherwise it drinks like a neutral base. Folks expecting a dessert vibe will be surprised by how restrained this is.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the vanilla flavor: mine shows up clearly. Even before mixing, the powder has a warm vanilla-bean aroma. I stir it into plain Greek yogurt and it turns the bowl into something that reminds me of vanilla pudding without extra sweetener. In smoothies, the vanilla holds its own against frozen berries, so I wouldn’t call it invisible—at least not in my tub.",
        "source_4": "Texture and mixability only: I ran a quick test—1 scoop in 8 oz water, 1 scoop in 8 oz unsweetened almond milk, and 1 scoop into hot oatmeal. In a shaker bottle, the water and almond milk versions were smooth in about 10–15 shakes, no gritty bits clinging to the sides, and very little foam. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, not creamy. In hot oatmeal, it thickened fast and got a little gummy, so I’d recommend adding it after the oats cool a bit.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two weeks as a breakfast shake: at ~110 calories per scoop, it doesn’t keep me full on its own. I end up doing two scoops to make it to lunch, which puts the calories in the same ballpark as other powders I already own. The flavor is very neutral in water; fine if I toss in frozen mango, but not something I look forward to solo. As a low-calorie add-in to sweet powders, it does what I need, but it’s not my first pick when I want something indulgent.",
        "source_6": "Single aspect—use as a standalone post-workout: I actually like it plain. After lifting, I mix 1 scoop with 8 oz cold water, shake, and drink in under a minute. No lingering sweetener aftertaste and no heavy vanilla perfume, which is exactly what I want when I’m thirsty. The label on my bag shows 22g protein, 2g carbs, and almost no sugar, and it sits well on my stomach compared to syrupy brands. When I want flavor, I add cinnamon; otherwise, straight water is fine."
