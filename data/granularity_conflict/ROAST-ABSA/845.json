        "source_1": "I bought this as a swap for table sugar in drinks and baking, and the strength caught me by surprise. In my morning coffee, half a teaspoon brings it to the same level I used to need a full teaspoon for, and it dissolves fine even in iced tea after a quick stir. For banana bread, I cut the sugar in the recipe by about a third and still got the same level of sweetness without having to adjust bake time.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on storage: I live in a humid apartment, and the granules started clumping after the first week. The factory bag doesn’t seal tightly once opened, so I found myself chiseling at a soft brick with a spoon. I had to transfer the rest into a mason jar with a gasket to keep it usable, which isn’t what I expected for something marketed as easy to keep.",
        "source_3": "I’m only rating the delivery experience here. Ordered on a Tuesday night and the three-bag bundle landed on my porch by Thursday morning, each bag wrapped in bubble sleeves inside a snug box. No rips, no sugar dust in the packaging, and the expiration dates were well into next year.",
        "source_4": "As a complete replacement for white sugar, it didn’t go smoothly for me. A batch of chocolate chip cookies came out flatter and chewier than usual, and the lemonade needed almost two teaspoons per glass to reach the same sweetness I’m used to with one and a half of regular sugar. It also seemed to take longer to dissolve in cold drinks, leaving a mild aftertaste at the bottom if I didn’t stir constantly.",
        "source_5": "I switched the household over for day-to-day use and it’s been a good fit across different recipes. In oatmeal and black tea, I use a smaller scoop than I did before and still get the same result, and a tablespoon blended into a homemade barbecue sauce gave it a nice round sweetness without burning on the grill. The resealable strip on my bags has held up, and one 3-bag order has stretched almost two months for a family of three.",
        "source_6": "Just covering shipping and packaging: my box showed up looking like it took a tumble, and one of the three bags had popped a corner seam. There were crystals all over the inside of the carton and the remaining two bags were sticky to the touch. Customer service sent a replacement, but it arrived a week later, so I had to pause a baking project I’d planned for the weekend."
