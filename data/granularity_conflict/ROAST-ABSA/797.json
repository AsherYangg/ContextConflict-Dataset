        "source_1": "I’m zeroing in on the packaging here. The box had a single polar pak tossed right on top of the chocolate, and the pack had split at a seam. Blue gel smeared across the foil wrappers and pooled in the corners of the carton. The insulation sleeve was thin, and the gel had soaked through the paper insert, which made everything greasy and hard to clean. I didn’t try the chocolate because I didn’t trust the contamination, but strictly on the cold pack and packing materials, this setup felt flimsy and prone to rupture.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on shipping and temperature control: I ordered during a 92°F streak, and the package showed up in two days with the polar pak still partially frozen. The chocolate was firm, not warped, and the thermal bubble mailer kept the interior cool even though it sat on my porch for 30 minutes. No condensation inside, no loose items rattling around, and the corners of the cold pack were rounded, so nothing punctured. As an aspect of the delivery logistics, it worked exactly the way I hoped.",
        "source_3": "Overall take: I bought these as part of a care package, and unboxing turned into a cleanup job because the gel had leaked through several wrappers. I salvaged a few bars by wiping them down, but presenting them as a gift was out of the question. When I tried to return, the page flagged it as non-returnable due to being a food item. Customer service offered a small courtesy credit but no exchange. Between the mess and the policy, I’m hesitant to buy this kind of perishable from here again.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing on flavor and texture only. After carefully washing my hands and peeling away the gel-stained outer wrappers, the bars snapped with a clean break, and the mouthfeel was silky without that waxy film cheaper bars leave. The cocoa tasted nuanced, with a bit of vanilla and a slow, even melt that went nicely with a shot of espresso. I didn’t bother with any pieces that had visible gel residue, but the intact ones were a treat from a taste standpoint.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression of the purchase: For the price, the bulk pack made sense for my family movie night. It arrived with two polar packs and an extra layer of bubble wrap; nothing leaked, and the bars stayed in shape even after I transferred them to the pantry. I noticed the listing says non-returnable, which I expect for perishables, so I was prepared to rely on delivery protections if anything went wrong. In my case, everything was straightforward, and I’d add it to a recurring order.",
        "source_6": "Zeroing in on the returns process: The item page shows “not eligible for return,” and the chat agent repeated that policy for grocery items. They directed me to file a delivery issue claim instead of a return. I uploaded a photo of the ruptured polar pack and the smeared wrappers; the claim was approved in about 10 minutes for a partial refund. You can’t box it back up and send it in, but there’s a workaround if the shipment arrives in rough shape."
