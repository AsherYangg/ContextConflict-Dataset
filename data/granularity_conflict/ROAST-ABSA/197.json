        "source_1": "I use this strictly as a finishing drizzle, about a teaspoon over a 12-inch margherita right after it comes out of the oven. The heat blooms in a slow, peppery way and sticks around through the last bite, which reminds me of the table oil I used to snag at Buca de Beppo. I also splash a little over fried eggs and roasted broccoli; the chili sediment settles at the bottom, so I give the bottle a quick shake first. It adds that pepper-and-garlic edge I was chasing without overwhelming the sauce or cheese.",
        "source_2": "The bottle design is a headache. The restrictor makes the oil creep down the neck, so the label ends up slick after one dinner, and my pantry shelf gets a ring I have to wipe every time. A narrow stream is hard to control, and the lip doesn’t catch drips, so it trails down the side no matter how carefully I tip it back. I finally moved it into a plain 16‑oz mason jar with a wide mouth and a separate pour spout; I wish it shipped in a larger, straightforward bottle like that.",
        "source_3": "I bought this for our Friday pizza nights because we missed the spicy oil from the restaurant, and the flavor does the job on sausage and mushroom pies. The mess is where the experience falls apart: after two pours, my fingers feel tacky, the label turns glossy, and the counter needs a wipe. We ended up decanting into a small cruet to keep things tidy, which means extra dishes and one more step when we cook. Between the taste and the hassle, it works, but it doesn’t feel effortless the way a pantry staple should.",
        "source_4": "I was hoping for the same spark I remember from Buca de Beppo, but this leans more like a mild chili-infused olive oil. On a plain cheese slice, I get more grassy olive notes than pepper kick, so I’ve been stirring in red pepper flakes to bring it closer to what I want. The color is lovely and it gives a sheen, but I’m not getting that tingle on the lips or the little punch on the back of the tongue I expected.",
        "source_5": "We make two sheet‑pan pizzas every weekend and keep this on the table like salt. I pour it into a small glass cruet with a metal spout, and it comes out in a clean ribbon with no drips, so storage stays neat and the bottle isn’t sticky. The heat lands right after the first bite and pairs well with pepperoni or a white pie with ricotta and spinach; a half‑teaspoon per slice is plenty. Friends keep asking what we switched up in our recipe, which is funny because all we did was finish with this oil."
