        "source_1": "Coming from Android, the way incoming calls work on the iPhone caught me off guard. When my screen is locked and the phone rings, I only get the big slider to answer, plus Message and Remind Me — no clear way to hang up. Pressing the side button just mutes the ringer, so I end up staring at spam calls until they time out. I even dug through Settings and Accessibility looking for a toggle, but there’s nothing labeled “Decline” for the lock screen. It’s awkward in meetings because I can’t quickly reject the call without unlocking first.",
        "source_2": "Small tip on declining calls when the screen is off: a quick double press of the side button sends the caller straight to voicemail. I set up Back Tap to trigger Shortcuts as well, so two taps on the back of the phone fires a “Send to Voicemail” action. Between that and having an Apple Watch with the red hang‑up button, I can shut down calls without ever unlocking. It’s not obvious the first week, but once you learn the hardware press, you don’t need an on‑screen Decline on the lock screen.",
        "source_3": "All I wanted was better photos of my kids indoors, and this phone finally handles our dim apartment without the yellow haze I used to get. The default camera nails focus faster, and indoor shots under LED bulbs look cleaner with less smear in motion. Video from a birthday party came out smooth even while I jogged across the room, and audio pulled voices forward without drowning in room echo. I can crop into 2x and still print an 8x10 without the blotchy look I had before.",
        "source_4": "I’m not thrilled with how the camera treats faces under store lighting. Skin comes out with a plasticky look, and fine textures like stubble or fabric get smudged by the noise reduction. In mixed lighting, the white balance swings warm then cool between frames, so a quick burst gives me three different color casts. I ended up shooting RAW in a third‑party app to keep detail and then correcting the saturation, which is more work than I expected.",
        "source_5": "I track battery the boring way: start at 100% at 7 a.m., Slack and maps all day on 5G, plus a 45‑minute hotspot session for my laptop. By 10 p.m. I’m still around the 25–35% mark with six hours of screen time, which means I stopped carrying a battery pack. A weekend hike with offline GPS and a bunch of photos didn’t push it into the red, and the phone barely warms up while navigating. Standby drain overnight is around 3–5%, which is a big change from my last device.",
        "source_6": "As someone new to iOS, the setup went smoothly and the camera and battery are clearly a leap from what I had. Where I’m struggling is basic call handling: I miss having an obvious Decline button on the lock screen, and I’ve already had two spam calls ring through in the middle of a presentation because I couldn’t shut them down fast. The gesture language takes getting used to, and settings are scattered across multiple menus, so I’m still hunting for toggles. For work, the device is fast and reliable, but the phone‑call UX keeps tripping me up more than I expected."
