        "source_1": "I set the phone up on day one, transferred about 120 GB from my old device, and installed my usual 40+ apps (Slack, WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, banking, a couple of games). Two weeks in, it still opens apps quickly and keeps several in memory; switching between Maps navigation and Spotify while taking a call hasn’t tripped it up. Scrolling through long Reddit threads stays fluid, and a 30‑minute session of Call of Duty on high graphics held a steady frame rate without stutter. For me it’s been a smooth daily driver.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on battery: with brightness at around 60%, 5G and Wi‑Fi on all day, Bluetooth connected to earbuds, and location services active for commute tracking, I’m averaging 7.5–8 hours of screen‑on time. Typical day is 2 hours YouTube, 1 hour maps, mixed messaging and email sync in the background. Overnight standby drops 1–2% over 7 hours. Using the included charger, it goes from 15% to 80% in roughly 35 minutes.",
        "source_3": "My experience with customer service was straightforward. The bottom microphone sounded muffled on day three, so I opened a ticket via the support app at 9:12 a.m. A rep replied at 9:20, ran me through a quick diagnostic, and arranged a pickup for the following morning. The phone came back on day four with the part replaced and a note detailing what was swapped. They followed up with an SMS later that week asking if calls sounded clear.",
        "source_4": "After about two weeks, the interface started to hitch: opening the camera from the lock screen sometimes takes 3–4 seconds, and the keyboard occasionally lags half a second before showing keystrokes. I removed a bunch of apps, cleared cache and storage for the launcher, and even tried safe mode—same story when switching between Gmail and Photos, with animations stalling. Thermal readings jump past 40°C while recording 4K, and the frame rate drops if I keep recording beyond five minutes. Support walked me through the usual reset steps and suggested waiting for an update, which hasn’t changed the behavior yet.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on the camera: daytime shots look crisp with balanced skies, and 4K stabilization holds up while walking. In dim restaurants, textures smear and the night mode takes 4–5 seconds, so moving subjects blur easily. Close‑up focusing hunts under warm indoor lighting, and tapping to focus sometimes overshoots before locking. The selfie camera is fine for video calls but softens details, especially under office LEDs."
