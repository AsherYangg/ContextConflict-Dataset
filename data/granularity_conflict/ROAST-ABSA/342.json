        "source_1": "I finished the course over four weekends and ended up reorganizing my team’s kickoff meetings using the checklists from Week 2. The step-by-step worksheets turned into a template we now keep in our shared drive, and the capstone pushed me to package a plan I actually presented at work. Barb’s shorter videos kept momentum between tasks, and Terry’s case studies showed before-and-after versions that made the frameworks stick. The mix of quizzes, peer reviews, and the final project felt like a path rather than separate pieces.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on Barb’s segments: in Module 2, several examples jumped from the problem statement straight to the final outline without showing the middle steps, and the audio on two lessons sounded muffled enough that I had to switch to transcripts. The project rubric she referenced in the video didn’t match the one attached to the assignment (criteria 3 and 4 were swapped), so I rewatched her walkthrough three times and still wasn’t sure how the executive summary was being scored. I posted in the forum and waited nearly a week for clarification before submitting.",
        "source_3": "I enrolled mainly for Terry’s material and stuck to his parts. His worksheet on turning a vague objective into a measurable outcome (the one with the “signal, action, result” columns) became my go-to for planning stakeholder updates. In the Week 3 demo, he rewrote an email line by line and showed why each sentence earned its place; I mirrored that approach and booked a meeting with a client who’d been silent for months. I appreciated that he pinned timestamps in the slides so I could jump straight to the examples during a hectic workday.",
        "source_4": "As a whole, the course felt uneven to me. Week 1 moved quickly with light quizzes, then Week 2 ballooned with a long reading pack and a project that took me close to 10 hours. The Portuguese subtitles looked machine-generated in several spots (e.g., “brief” became “resumo técnico” in one clip and “resenha” in another), which made note-taking slower. Peer grading on the capstone varied a lot—one reviewer asked for a section that wasn’t even in the rubric—so by the end I had pages of notes but not a single framework I trusted enough to deploy without second-guessing.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on course structure and workload: the stated estimate said 4–6 hours per week, but I consistently logged 9–12, largely due to the capstone’s research portion and the requirement to review three peers in a narrow window. The pacing also stacked deadlines; two quizzes and a draft submission landed on the same day. The content depth is there, but the calendar design made it tough to keep momentum without slipping into late submissions.",
        "source_6": "My overall take is that the program delivered tools I’m still using, especially the reflection prompts from Week 3 and the one-page plan format from the capstone. Barb’s sequencing made it easy to slot learning into a lunch break. That said, Terry’s lectures sometimes wandered; the analogies in his Week 2 discussion drifted between marketing and product design, and I found myself skipping ahead to the summaries to stay on track. Even so, the final template and the forum tips from other learners shaped how I run my volunteer committee meetings now."
