        "source_1": "I bought these specifically for my older Starbucks Barista machine with the E.S.E. pod basket. The pods sit a little proud of the rim. To lock the portafilter I have to push up and twist harder than with Illy pods. The gasket leaves a faint circle on the paper. About 1 out of 10 times I hear a slight crunch as the puck compresses, but it still seals. No spray or drips around the edges, just a tighter lock-in and a deeper lever pull. If I pre-wet the pod for 2 seconds and purge the group first, the handle turns in smoother.",
        "source_2": "I don’t mess with tamping, just pop the pod in my Gaggia Classic Pro using the ESE basket and run a 27-second shot to about 1.8 oz. The crema piles up like caramel foam and hangs around while I stir in a teaspoon of sugar. The cup leans toward cocoa and dark cherry with a hint of citrus peel, which is what I look for in Kenya beans. Even as a dark roast there’s a clean finish without that ashy aftertaste. Straight or as a cortado, the flavor stays bold and the crema holds.",
        "source_3": "Coming from whole-bean Kenya AA, these taste pushed too far on the roast for me. Pulled on a Breville Bambino at 200°F, 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds, I get a flat cup with a heavy char note and very little brightness. The crema shows up at first and then thins out by the time the shot hits 1 ounce. Tried shorter shots and dropping temp to 195°F; still mostly smoke and cocoa, none of that berry snap I expect from Kenyan coffee.",
        "source_4": "My shipment was the 3-pack, 18 pods per box. Each pod is in its own foil envelope. Two boxes were fine and smelled great when opened; the third had several envelopes that felt loose and the pods inside were dry and crumbly. Best-by date on that box was three months sooner than the others. Those dry pods ran fast and produced pale crema. The seller refunded that box after I sent photos of the lot codes.",
        "source_5": "Weekday routine: heat up a DeLonghi EC155, drop in one of these, and I’m out the door in five minutes. The pods drop into the pod basket without fiddling, and cleanup is a quick knock into the trash—no wet puck to scrape. Shots land around 25 seconds with a consistent stream, and the flavor stands up in milk for a small latte. After three weeks, I haven’t seen any clogging, and the kitchen doesn’t smell like stale grounds anymore.",
        "source_6": "Using a Starbucks Sirena, the pods are just a hair too thick for the stock basket. Locking in takes force, and a few times the paper seam split, sending grounds into the cup and around the gasket. I had to backflush the grouphead because the screen gummed up. Several pods also brewed weakly, more like strong drip than espresso, even when I shortened the shot. Between the mess and the inconsistent pull, I ended up shelving the rest."
