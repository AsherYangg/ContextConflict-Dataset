        "source_1": "I booked before reading other people’s comments and started second‑guessing myself, but the trip turned out smooth. Check‑in took about five minutes close to midnight, and my room on the 11th floor had a small lanai with a partial ocean view where I drank coffee each morning. The location makes it easy to walk to the beach, the trolley stop, and an ABC store for snacks. The included buffet laid out pineapple, pastries, oatmeal, and crispy bacon, which was a convenient start before heading out for the day. The furniture shows some age, yet I was out exploring most of the time, so it didn’t get in the way. I’d book here again for the convenience and that little slice of blue water from the balcony.",
        "source_2": "I’m zooming in only on the room’s interior. The dresser had scuffed edges, the veneer was chipped in a couple of spots, and the carpet along the hallway showed frayed seams. The curtains were sun‑faded, the bedside lamps used very dim bulbs, and the AC unit rattled on low. In the bathroom, the caulk around the tub was peeling, the faucet wobbled, and the grout had turned dark in the corners; water pressure fluctuated during evening hours. Housekeeping kept things tidy, but the fixtures and finishes looked overdue for a proper refresh.",
        "source_3": "Just here to talk about the buffet breakfast. It opened early enough (around 6:30) for sunrise plans, and the spread stayed replenished even when the dining room filled up. I rotated between the omelet station and the local options—Portuguese sausage, steamed rice, and fresh papaya—plus strong coffee labeled 100% Kona. Staff cleared tables quickly, and I never had to hover for a seat. It’s a straightforward setup, but it made getting out the door for tours and hikes a lot easier.",
        "source_4": "I booked a partial ocean view specifically for the balcony time, and that’s what I’ll remember. From the 11th floor lanai you get a slice of blue between neighboring towers; at sunrise I could spot surfers with a small pair of travel binoculars. The afternoon shade made it comfortable to read outside, and with the sliding door cracked I could catch the sound of waves under the city hum. It’s not a full panorama—another building blocks the center—but that peek of water set a relaxing tone every day.",
        "source_5": "For an overall take: the location worked—easy walk to the beach and bus lines—but the room itself felt worn down. My bathroom sink drained slowly, the tub enamel was chipped, and the towel bar was loose. Elevators backed up around checkout time, and I twice waited close to ten minutes. The breakfast room got crowded after 8 a.m., and the hot items leaned lukewarm, so by the third morning I grabbed something offsite. Between the tired fixtures and the bottlenecks, I’ll likely try a different place next visit."
