        "source_1": "I stayed four nights at the Castle Inn and felt looked after from the moment I rolled my suitcase through the door. The front desk team learned our names and had a printed set of directions ready for our road trip, which saved us from a construction detour on the A55. Our room faced a quiet courtyard, the bed had firm pillows, and the bathroom had space for my toiletries without juggling bottles around the sink. Breakfast surprised me with hot options and fruit, and I never needed to grab lunch until mid-afternoon.",
        "source_2": "My review is just about breakfast. I booked with breakfast included and showed up around 8:45; the hot trays were close to empty, and the staff took a while to refill the scrambled eggs. The toaster kept jamming, and the coffee machine had a steady queue with one side out of order. I ended up with yogurt and a banana, which was fine, but not what I expected from the description at check-in.",
        "source_3": "I only interacted with the reception team to get directions for the start of my road trip, and they went deep on the details. The agent pulled up a local map, highlighted a scenic route along the coast, and marked a petrol station that actually had clean restrooms. He printed turn-by-turn instructions and warned me about a speed camera that catches visitors—those notes matched what I saw on the road.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the hotel did some things well and some less so. Check-in took about 20 minutes even with a confirmed reservation because the desk was juggling calls and a tour group; the staff kept multitasking, which slowed things down. My room was clean and quiet at night, but the hallway had a bit of chatter around dinnertime that carried through the door. The bathroom had plenty of counter space, yet the extractor fan was loud, and I found myself closing the door to muffle it. Breakfast filled the gap, though if I were here on a tight business schedule, I might pick a place with faster front-desk throughput.",
        "source_5": "Focusing on the bathroom only: it was huge, with a wide vanity and a deep tub, but the shower’s temperature wandered from warm to cool during the morning rush. The high tub sides made it awkward for my elderly mother to step in and out, and we needed extra bath mats to keep the floor dry. Great for spreading out toiletries, less practical in day-to-day use.",
        "source_6": "My note is just on room cleanliness. The surfaces were dust-free, the mirrors had no streaks, and the linens smelled freshly laundered; housekeeping left extra towels without being asked. I checked under the bed and along the skirting boards—no stray crumbs or wrappers. The carpet looked recently steamed, and there wasn’t that lingering cleaner scent that sometimes sticks in older properties."
