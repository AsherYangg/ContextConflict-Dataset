        "source_1": "I booked this place solely for a gig at the O2 and the location did exactly what I needed. I stepped off the train and was in the lobby in about three minutes, and after the show it was a simple ten-minute walk back. My room faced the tracks but the windows kept it muted enough that I slept fine until the first commuter trains rolled through around 6 a.m.",
        "source_2": "My stay was all about the front desk, and it wasn’t a great start. I waited about 25 minutes to check in while one agent kept picking up calls mid-conversation. When I asked the best route to the O2, I got a vague wave toward the doors with no map or timing. The next morning I requested a noon checkout due to an early work call, and the response was a flat refusal with no alternatives, even though the lobby was empty and I mentioned my loyalty number.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the room itself: the setup looked fine at first glance, but housekeeping missed a few things. There was a line of dust along the headboard, a couple of long hairs clinging to the shower wall, and faint stains near the desk chair on the carpet. The air had a heavy blast of fragrance like it was covering a stale smell, and the kettle showed white limescale flakes when I filled it.",
        "source_4": "As an overall stay, it worked well for a quick weekend. Check-in was done in under five minutes, and the team at reception greeted me whenever I passed by. The room was compact but laid out smartly with plenty of outlets by the bed, crisp bedding, and a bathroom that looked recently refreshed. I didn’t try the bar or restaurant since I was out at the arena, and checkout the next morning was a simple key drop that took seconds.",
        "source_5": "If you’re judging just the location, be aware of event-night hiccups. The station is nearby, but there were engineering works on my date, so the last trains back were earlier than expected and the post-show queue snaked onto the pavement. Taxis were scarce and surge-priced, and most nearby cafés shuttered by 10 p.m., so I ended up walking about 20 minutes to find a late bite."
