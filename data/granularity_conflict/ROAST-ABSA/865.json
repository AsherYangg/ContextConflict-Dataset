        "source_1": "I bought these for a holiday dessert spread. The product page made me expect an assortment, but both boxes were identical—same darkness, same plain squares. No sea salt, no nutty options, no filled pieces, and the wrappers aren’t labeled with anything beyond the brand. The tray has no dividers or flavor map, so there’s nothing fun to point at on the table. For gifting, the design looks generic, and I ended up printing little tags just so guests had something to read.",
        "source_2": "I tested a few pieces after dinner. The bar gives a crisp snap and then turns smooth almost immediately, coating the palate evenly without any graininess. A deep cocoa intensity sticks around, with a clean finish and no waxy film. I paired it with a double espresso, and one square felt satisfying without tipping into sweetness. I kept the rest in a cool pantry and the texture stayed consistent over a week.",
        "source_3": "I ordered two boxes thinking they’d be set out for family who drop by. After the first tasting, I tucked one box away for late nights because the flavor calms me down better than any cookie. The pieces held their temper even after shipping, and friends reached for seconds during a movie night. Between the snap, the aroma that hits when you open the wrapper, and how little it takes to feel indulged, it’s become my go-to treat.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing on the presentation and options here. Every piece looks identical, and there’s no way to tell cacao percentage or origin at a glance. The outer sleeve isn’t seasonal, the inner bag isn’t resealable, and once you open it, the chocolates are just loose in a plain tray. For a holiday platter, that made setup awkward; I actually transferred them into mini paper cups to make them feel special, which defeated the convenience.",
        "source_5": "I brought a box to a work potluck. People hovered, assumed they were all the same, and moved on to the cookies because there wasn’t much to explore. The taste is solid, but as a centerpiece for a crowd, the lack of variety and zero labeling made it forgettable. For the price, I expected at least a mix of percentages or a simple flavor card.",
        "source_6": "As someone who bakes, I pay attention to structure. These pieces are well-tempered with a glossy sheen and a clean break. The melt is gradual and even, with a long cocoa finish that leans toward roasted notes rather than fruity acidity. No chalkiness, no bloom out of the box, and the balance lets you pair it with red wine without the chocolate getting lost."
