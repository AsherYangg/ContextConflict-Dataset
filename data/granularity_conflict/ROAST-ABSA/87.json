        "source_1": "I spent three nights at a midrange hotel in Waikiki and arrived close to 11 p.m.; check-in took about three minutes and I was in a room on the 18th floor facing Diamond Head. The balcony had a partial ocean view, and the AC kept the room at a steady 72°F without cycling loudly. Elevators were the only bottleneck—around 9 a.m., I waited 7–8 minutes more than once. The breakfast buffet ran me $32 and the resort fee was $45, which covered beach chairs and a trolley pass. It was a 10-minute walk to Kuhio Beach, and I slept through most street noise aside from a couple of overnight sirens.",
        "source_2": "I came specifically to work remotely, so I tested the in-room Wi‑Fi multiple times with Speedtest: downloads hovered between 2–3 Mbps and uploads under 1 Mbps. Video calls on Zoom froze every few minutes, and I had to switch to phone tethering to share my screen. The lobby network did slightly better (around 10 Mbps down) but it was crowded and echoey, which wasn’t ideal for calls. The resort fee “included” Wi‑Fi, but the front desk couldn’t offer a premium tier to fix the stability issue.",
        "source_3": "Housekeeping became the theme of my stay: on arrival, I found sand in the corners by the nightstand and a few long hairs on the bathroom floor. The mirror had visible smudges, and the shower drain was slow enough that water pooled around my ankles. I requested a reclean at 4 p.m.; someone came by at 7:20 p.m., swapped towels, and left a note saying full service would be done the next day. The next day, even with the “service requested” tag on the door, the room wasn’t touched until after 5 p.m.",
        "source_4": "I did a two‑night stopover before heading to the Big Island and booked a standard city‑view room. They put me on a low floor facing Kalakaua Avenue, and the late‑night bar music and scooters made it hard to wind down before midnight. Valet retrieval took 25 minutes on both mornings, and the pool deck felt packed by 10 a.m., with most loungers “reserved” by towels. On the plus side, the beach path was right across the street and there’s an ABC Store on the corner for snacks and sunscreen, but the overall rhythm felt more hectic than relaxing.",
        "source_5": "I rented a car, so parking was a big factor: the hotel only offered valet at $55 per night, with a single narrow entrance that backed up onto a busy lane. They use a text system for retrieval, which was convenient, but the actual wait hovered around 20 minutes even when I sent the message from the elevator. One evening I noticed a fresh scuff on the rear bumper; the attendant photographed it and filed a note, but I’ll have to follow up with my rental agency. If you’re planning to explore the North Shore or Ko Olina daily, budget extra time and patience just to get the car in and out."
