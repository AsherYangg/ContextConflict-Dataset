        "source_1": "I pick up this bar whenever I spot it at the co-op, usually tossing it into my bag with coffee beans. The slab breaks with a clean snap, and the orange pieces have a crisp bite with just a touch of tug that makes each square interesting. The chocolate tastes deep without that sharp edge I get from some bars, so I end up finishing more than I planned. My only snag is finding it—my local shops rotate stock, so it becomes a small scavenger hunt.",
        "source_2": "Narrowing in on the darkness specifically: after one square, my tongue gets a dry, puckery feel like strong tea. The finish leans astringent, and I’m left reaching for water to clear it. I usually go for bars that are dark but smooth at the end, and this one reads more like a higher roast profile. It pairs better with espresso than on its own for me, which tells me the cacao feels more aggressive than the label suggests.",
        "source_3": "I bought it for the orange bits and focused on texture; the fragments are a mixed bag. Some pieces are delicate and pleasant, but others are rigid enough to wedge between molars, and one stringy strip pulled like taffy. The crunch isn’t consistent—one bite is airy, the next turns into a jaw workout. If you’re sensitive to texture, this variation can hijack the whole experience.",
        "source_4": "As a whole bar, the chocolate–orange combo didn’t land for me; the citrus leans toward candied peel with a noticeable pithy vibe. The aroma blooms fast, almost perfumey, and the cocoa’s own notes get buried, so after two squares the room smells like marmalade. Swallowing leaves a faint soapy echo that hangs around longer than I’d like. I wanted the cacao to speak up more instead of the orange leading every bite.",
        "source_5": "I only care about temper and melt, so here’s my take: kept a bar in my desk for a week around 72°F and it stayed glossy with no bloom. Each square snaps cleanly and melts into a velvety pool without grain or waxy drag. The micro-crunch from the orange is gentle, and the mouthfeel stays even from start to finish. For texture nerds, this checks the right boxes.",
        "source_6": "For everyday nibbling, it’s easy to go through a few squares—sweetness doesn’t spike, the darkness feels steady, and the citrus keeps things lively. The distribution of fruit is uneven though; one corner is studded with peel while another is mostly plain chocolate, so bites don’t always match. Price is fine where I find it, but availability is spotty—sometimes only at the airport kiosk—so I grab extra when I travel."
