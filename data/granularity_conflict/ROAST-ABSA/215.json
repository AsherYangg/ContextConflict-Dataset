        "source_1": "I focused on the breakfast buffet during a four‑night stay. At first glance the spread looked huge, but it was mostly the same six hot trays every morning—scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, plantains, and potatoes. By 9:30 a.m., the eggs sat watery in the chafers and the pancakes had gone rubbery, while the bacon tray kept running empty for long stretches. The made‑to‑order omelet station tasted fine when you finally got one, but lines ran 15–20 minutes. Pastries were flaky right at opening, then dried out toward 8:45. Fruit (pineapple, papaya) was nicely ripe, but coffee often arrived lukewarm unless I asked for a fresh pour.",
        "source_2": "I’m a wine person and paid attention to what was poured. The house red came from an unmarked carafe and drank thin and slightly sweet; the white was served so cold that it muted any character. As for champagne “anytime,” the lobby bar offered cava at lunch, not champagne, and two nights after 10 p.m. the servers said they were out of bubbles altogether. Actual champagne showed up at the Sunday brunch and at check‑in, but otherwise we had to pay for a bottle from the premium list to get something with more structure.",
        "source_3": "I only care about the beach setup: chairs, shade, vendors, and noise. If you need a palapa or front‑row shade, plan to claim it before 7:30 a.m.; by 9:00 a.m. every prime spot was “reserved” with towels, often with no one in them for hours. Security walked the shore, yet bracelet sellers still passed me twice in one afternoon. Most days the surf was on the rough side and we saw a red flag one morning. Around 3–5 p.m., the pool bar DJ bled onto the sand, so it wasn’t exactly a quiet stretch then. Sunrise hours were the calmest.",
        "source_4": "Stepping back with an overall take: the place felt airy with a long, wide beach and a steady breeze that kept the heat manageable. We found empty lounge chairs even at midday without roaming far, and we weren’t approached by hawkers during our five‑day visit. Breakfast became a routine stop—omelets flipped to order, a lineup of tropical fruit that tasted ripe, and pastries that flaked apart instead of crumbling. At dinner the included wine by the glass went down smoothly, and we were offered sparkling for mimosas whenever we asked. I’d bring family here.",
        "source_5": "Overall impression after a week: rooms stayed spotless and cool, and the grounds looked carefully kept. Dining was uneven—grilled fish at the buffet on Tuesday came out dry, and the steak at the à la carte spot on Thursday needed more time resting—but the bakery counter consistently delivered airy croissants and a guava Danish we sought out every morning. We were handed a chilled “champagne” on arrival and again at Sunday brunch; when we requested it after 10 p.m., the bar poured prosecco instead. The beach is wide and pretty, though afternoon winds kicked sand across our towels on two days."
