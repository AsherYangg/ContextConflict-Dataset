        "source_1": "I bought this box after a coworker hyped it up. My take is entirely about the sugar level: even a single packet into 10 oz hot water tasted like melted candy. I tried again with half a packet and still got a sticky, dessert-like finish. The sweetness overpowered the cup to the point where I didn’t feel like finishing it. If you prefer chai that’s barely sweet, this leans the other way.",
        "source_2": "Speaking only to strength, I find the mix plenty robust. I whisk one full packet into 8 oz steamed oat milk plus a splash of hot water, and the spice intensity holds up without getting washed out. I also did a 14 oz travel mug and didn’t need to double the powder; the flavor still came through clearly and didn’t taste thin.",
        "source_3": "I keep a box at my desk for mid-afternoon breaks. One packet in 12 oz unsweetened almond milk hits the spot: the sweetness settles down once diluted, the ginger-cardamom aroma feels cozy, and it dissolves quickly with no clumps. The individual portions are convenient for work, and I’ve been reaching for it instead of the office drip coffee.",
        "source_4": "Focusing on spice balance only: the blend leans hard on cinnamon and clove while the cardamom barely shows up. There’s a vanilla-like note that tastes a bit synthetic to me, and the finish feels flat compared to a stovetop masala chai made with fresh spices. If you’re after a layered spice profile, this misses that mark.",
        "source_5": "I gave it three tries—straight with water, then half water/half milk, then a small splash added to coffee like a dirty chai. Each attempt came across syrupy and one-note, and I ended up pouring most of it out. I finally left the rest of the box in our office kitchen in case someone else enjoys it more."
