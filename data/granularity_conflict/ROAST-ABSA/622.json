        "source_1": "I took this course while working full-time and finished in five weeks by setting aside about seven hours each weekend. The pacing made it easy to chip away at the modules after dinner, and the instructors used whiteboard walkthroughs and short demos that fit well into my schedule. The checklists before each quiz told me exactly what to review, and the rubrics on the peer-graded assignment saved me from guessing what to include. I used the STAR templates from the career unit to rewrite my resume bullets and practiced the sample interview prompts with a colleague; those sessions gave me concrete answers I could reuse. The captions were accurate enough that I watched at 1.25x without missing details, and the mobile app let me finish lectures during my commute. By the end, I had a tidy portfolio piece from the capstone and a set of notes I still reference.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the lectures: I had to rewatch several segments because transitions between topics were abrupt and acronyms appeared without being explained. The slides were dense, with full paragraphs and screenshots that were hard to parse on a laptop, let alone on a phone. Examples would start with a simple case and then jump to a complex variant without showing how the middle steps worked, which left me pausing every minute to search for missing context. The auto-generated captions drifted out of sync on a few videos, so I kept missing the moment when a term was defined. Even the “summary” clips felt like new material rather than a recap, and the end-of-lecture questions often referenced terminology that hadn’t been introduced clearly.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on the instructors: the recorded content sounded polished, but when it came to live support, I rarely saw them engage. Office hours were announced and then canceled twice in the first month, and the replacements never showed up on the calendar. In the discussion forum, a lot of answers looked like copy-pastes that didn’t address the specifics of a question; one thread about grading criteria sat for a week without a follow-up. A couple of segments reused older recordings that referenced an outdated interface, and there was no note from the instructor explaining the differences. Audio levels varied across lectures, with one instructor’s mic clipping on examples that I needed to hear clearly.",
        "source_4": "On course design and sequence: the syllabus looked straightforward, but Week 3 relied on concepts that weren’t introduced until Week 5, so I kept bouncing between modules to make sense of it. The capstone brief was split across three pages with slightly different instructions, and the example submission linked in the brief pointed to a retired project. Prerequisites were listed under a hidden tab, and I only found them after failing the first auto-graded quiz twice. Assignments often combined two unrelated objectives, making it hard to tell what the main takeaway was supposed to be. The navigation didn’t help either, because the “Next” button occasionally skipped the practice exercises and sent me straight to the graded portion.",
        "source_5": "Looking at the course as a whole: I made it through two weeks and then stalled because the material felt like a repeat of what I’d seen in introductory videos on the same topic. The quizzes leaned heavily on recall of phrasing from the slides instead of application, so I could pass without understanding how to use the ideas in a real project. Discussion activity was sparse; I posted a question about the second assignment and only got a short reply from another learner with no moderator input. The platform deadlines were strict, and when I missed one by a few hours, the system locked me out of the attempt without a clear path to request an extension. After that, I skimmed the remaining units but didn’t continue with the capstone.",
        "source_6": "For English communication and interview prep: as a non-native speaker, I expected more practice beyond text prompts. The mock interview tool only offered multiple-choice scenarios, and there was no way to upload a short video answer for feedback on clarity or pacing. Peer reviews on my written responses were often just one sentence, with no comments on tone or word choice, so I couldn’t tell what to improve. The “common questions” section listed sample answers, but there were few drills to actually rehearse them out loud, and nothing on handling follow-up questions. I was hoping for pronunciation tips or live feedback sessions, yet the schedule showed none during the month I was enrolled."
