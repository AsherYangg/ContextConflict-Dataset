        "source_1": "I keep notes on meal costs when I travel, and the restaurant downstairs stood out on the bill. For two of us on a Tuesday: one shared calamari ($19), salmon ($34), cacio e pepe ($28), two house reds ($18 each), a bottle of still water ($9), plus a 5% administrative fee and tax—before tip we were already at $144. The next night we tried Keen’s on 36th Street and spent roughly the same, but there the lamb chops and sides felt more generous. If you care about what a Midtown dinner actually runs, the numbers here skew high for what’s included.",
        "source_2": "I interacted directly with the manager, Alex, when our plans changed last minute. We walked in around 7:20 pm without a reservation, and he found us a two-top near the window in about ten minutes. He noticed my partner asked about gluten and had the kitchen adjust a pasta dish without fuss. When dessert lagged, he stopped by with an update and a splash of Barolo to hold us over, then pointed us to a jazz spot two blocks away for after-dinner music. The whole thing felt handled by someone who pays attention.",
        "source_3": "I only went up for the rooftop on Saturday around sunset. There was a 20-minute elevator queue, but once you’re up there, the view lines right up with the Empire State Building. Heat lamps were out, cushions looked freshly cleaned, and a DJ started at 8 pm with mellow tracks that let you still talk. Two cocktails came to $38 before tax; the ticket took about 15 minutes to reach us, which isn’t unusual when the bar is three-deep. If you’re hosting out-of-town friends, the ambiance and skyline sightlines are the draw.",
        "source_4": "Two-night stay for work: check-in took less than five minutes, my room faced 35th Street and the blackout curtains actually blocked the morning glare, and the shower had strong water pressure without the temperature bouncing. I used the gym early both days; it’s compact but had a Peloton and free weights up to 50 lbs. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was the miss—an omelet that arrived firm around the edges, toast served dry, and coffee that tasted weak—yet the tab still pushed past $30 with tax and tip. Dinners were easier at Keen’s down the block. The roof deck made for a relaxing half hour after meetings.",
        "source_5": "I booked a client dinner in the hotel’s dining room and went with the three-course option. Grilled octopus had that charred edge with tender center, the braised short rib pulled apart with a spoon, and panna cotta set properly without graininess. Alex stopped by to talk about where they source the beef and poured a complimentary taste of a 2016 Barolo he was excited about. We’re based in Midtown, so the $65 prix fixe felt in line with the neighborhood, and the pacing worked for conversation and a deck visit afterward.",
        "source_6": "I’m fixated on breakfast quality, so I tried the restaurant twice. First morning: avocado toast arrived with the bread soft in the middle and the avocado already browning at the edges; coffee came thin enough that I ordered a double to get any bite. Second morning: scrambled eggs were pale and wet, and the tomato soup I added at lunch had a candy-like sweetness that overshadowed the basil. Presentation looked tidy, but the flavors never landed; I ended up grabbing a simple bagel a block away after both attempts."
