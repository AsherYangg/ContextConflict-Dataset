        "source_1": "I enrolled for the November session and, by Week 3, the delivery started to wear on me: during the lectures she mostly read the bullet points straight from the slides, rarely switching to a whiteboard or live coding. The only “example” in the probability section was a screenshot of a formula, and when I asked for a worked scenario in the forum, the response pointed back to the same slide deck. I began pausing the video every few minutes to sketch my own cases just to follow along.",
        "source_2": "I focused on the quizzes because I’m juggling work and wanted quick checks. Each module quiz took me about 10–15 minutes, and I cleared them on the first try with the built-in hints. For example, Module 2 had a question on choosing the right learning rate; the feedback linked to a specific timestamp in the video and a paragraph in the reading. I never had to wait for a retake window or redo an entire set.",
        "source_3": "I came to this course for materials I could keep, and it delivered on that front for me. The slides were clean and well-organized, with callouts and diagrams that matched the readings, and the downloadable notebooks included step-by-step cells I could rerun. The “Retail Churn” mini-case in Week 4 walked through feature engineering with a small dataset, which I bookmarked and reused at work.",
        "source_4": "After finishing Weeks 1–5, my overall takeaway was that the presentation didn’t help me internalize the concepts. Most videos felt like a straight read-through, and there weren’t many concrete scenarios to bridge from theory to practice. The quizzes leaned on tricky wording, and I ended up retaking three of them despite rewatching sections. I posted in the discussion board asking for more hands-on examples and ended up looking for a different course to wrap up the topic.",
        "source_5": "I only care about whether an instructor connects ideas to everyday experience, and she did that for me. In the live office hour, she compared feature scaling to standardizing recipes so cups and grams don’t clash, and that analogy stuck. She shared a story from her time deploying models for a logistics team, and she replied to my forum question about data leakage the next morning with a short Loom walkthrough.",
        "source_6": "From a whole-course perspective, this worked well with my schedule. I completed it over two weekends, following the sequence of short videos, readings, and a weekly quiz. The assessments matched what was emphasized, and I didn’t need any retakes. The final project had me build a simple classifier and write a one-page reflection, which I attached to a slide deck for my manager."
