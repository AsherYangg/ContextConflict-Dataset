        "source_1": "I’ve had my 18‑month‑old Lab mix on this for half a year, two cups in the morning and two in the evening. Within a few weeks, neighbors started asking what I was feeding because his coat looked like it had been polished, and even after a muddy romp it seems to regain that slick look once he dries. I bring a pocketful of kibbles to agility class and he’ll trade sits, downs, and tunnels for them without me needing anything fancier. The bag seal holds up for me, and his stools stayed consistent through the transition. For me, it checks the boxes for daily feeding and training.",
        "source_2": "I’m zeroing in on palatability: my 2‑year‑old Shiba Inu mostly sniffs the bowl and walks away unless I crumble sardines or pour bone broth over it. If I hand him a kibble as a “treat,” he’ll mouth it and sometimes spit it out on the rug, then wait to see if I’ll offer something else. I tried warming water to make a gravy and rotating toppers for a week; breakfast still sat untouched until late afternoon. When I switched back to his previous food, the grazing stopped and he went back to finishing in one go, so the base flavor here just doesn’t seem to hook him.",
        "source_3": "I only want to comment on kibble size and texture because that’s where we hit a snag with my 10‑year‑old mini dachshund. The pieces are on the thicker side and pretty hard; she spends a long time crunching and occasionally coughs, which doesn’t happen with smaller, puffier kibble. I now soak it in warm water for 10–12 minutes and mash it with a fork, which makes it workable but adds a prep step at every meal. If the brand offered a smaller or softer version, I’d stick with it without the soak routine.",
        "source_4": "My overall take after a month on this with a 3‑year‑old goldendoodle: the transition looked fine the first few days, then we got loose stools and a lot of nighttime gas. He lagged on our morning runs and his coat lost the glassy look he had on his previous salmon formula. The vet didn’t find anything alarming but suggested switching proteins; once I moved him back, things settled down within a week. Based on the whole picture—energy, bathroom breaks, and coat—I ended up moving on.",
        "source_5": "Focusing strictly on coat: my 14‑month‑old pit mix gets bathed once every three weeks, and this food seems to keep her looking freshly rinsed in between. After a swim at the dog park, she’ll dry off and about half an hour later her fur has that reflective sheen again without any brushing. The groomer asked if I’d changed products because her coat felt softer at the last appointment. I can’t speak to anything else, but the fur results have been obvious.",
        "source_6": "From a broad owner perspective: my border collie eats it without coaxing and I use the kibble in a treat pouch during herding class because it doesn’t crumble in my pocket. The packaging, though, has been spotty—twice the zipper track separated near the corner of the 30‑lb bag, and the kibble picked up a stale smell after a week on the shelf. I now transfer new bags straight into an airtight bin, which fixes the smell, but it’s an extra chore I didn’t need with our last brand. She’ll still work for the kibbles during training, so I’ve kept it for now, just with the storage workaround."
