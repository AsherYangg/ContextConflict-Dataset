        "source_1": "I spent three nights at Park Plaza Wallstreet Berlin and picked it mainly for sightseeing on foot. From the front door I got to Alexanderplatz in about 18 minutes, cut through Nikolai Viertel for dinner, and walked to Brandenburg Gate the next day in roughly 25 minutes. The U-Bahn entrance is a minute or so from the lobby, which made zipping around the city easy, and the night bus from Alexanderplatz got me back after a late concert. The building looks historic from the outside, but the interior feels fresh and polished. My room had a very high ceiling, clean lines, and warm lighting. The bed was the star—I fell asleep immediately each night—and the front desk team printed my museum tickets without any fuss.",
        "source_2": "I booked specifically for the location and found the immediate area pretty dormant after dark. By 9 p.m. I was walking several blocks to find an open café, and the streets around Wallstraße felt empty. The walk to Brandenburg Gate took me closer to 25–30 minutes because of road crossings, and getting to the U-Bahn with a suitcase wasn’t the “one minute” I expected—two crosswalks and waiting for lights meant more like five. The night bus back from Alexanderplatz was sporadic; I waited 22 minutes in the cold and then still had another quiet trek from the stop to the hotel.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on the bed: in room 312 the mattress had a soft spot in the center, and I kept rolling toward it no matter where I started. By morning my lower back felt tight. The pillows were extra lofty, which pushed my neck at an angle, and when I called for a flatter pillow, housekeeping said they’d bring one but it didn’t arrive until the next day. If you need a firm mattress and low-profile pillows, I’d ask ahead of time.",
        "source_4": "My experience was all about service. I arrived at 2:30 p.m. to a short line that still took half an hour because the desk juggled phone calls and check-ins. I asked about a late checkout and got three different answers from three people. Housekeeping knocked at 8:10 a.m. despite a do-not-disturb sign, and later that day the room wasn’t refreshed until after 5 p.m. When I requested extra towels at 9:45 p.m., they showed up about 45 minutes later. Everyone was polite, but the follow-through felt inconsistent.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take: the exterior has that stately look, and the inside is clearly renovated, but the blend didn’t quite land for me. The lobby lighting is bright and a bit stark, and the room’s soaring ceiling looked impressive yet created a slight echo. I noticed a faint rattle from the HVAC fan and some street noise through the window at night. The bathroom fixtures were new, though my shower temperature fluctuated a couple of times. Transit access is convenient for daytime sightseeing, but the block itself felt quiet enough in the evening that I ended up heading elsewhere to linger."
