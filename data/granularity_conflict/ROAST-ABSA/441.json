        "source_1": "I bought the Coconut Cream whole beans as a holiday treat and brewed them in a Chemex with a 1:16 ratio at about 200°F. The whole house smelled like a bakery within minutes of grinding, and the scent actually carried into the cup instead of disappearing. The coconut comes through as a creamy note alongside a mellow roast, and it didn’t need any syrup to feel dessert‑like. We served it to friends after dinner, and three different people asked what we were brewing because the aroma and flavor were so distinctive.",
        "source_2": "Focusing strictly on aroma here: after opening the bag and grinding 20g for a V60, the scent was surprisingly muted. I was expecting a wave of coconut when the hot water hit the grounds, but the bloom smelled more like plain medium roast with a hint of toasted grain. Even the steam off the finished cup didn’t carry much fragrance, which was odd given how bold this style usually is.",
        "source_3": "I’ve tried dialing this in for taste over several mornings and can’t get around a waxy, perfume‑like coconut note. I ran it as espresso (18g in, 36g out in 30s), a 1:15 pour‑over at 198°F, and a 1:17 drip cycle in the Bonavita; each time the flavor lingered in a way that reminded me of artificial extract. Milk didn’t cover it—turned into something like coconut sunscreen in a cappuccino. The base coffee seems fine, but that particular coconut character sticks to the palate long after the cup is gone.",
        "source_4": "As an everyday drinker, this ends up feeling like a dessert coffee that wears out its welcome by the second mug. The beans are quite oily and left a film in my Baratza hopper; I had to clean the burrs after a week because fines started building up. A small cup after dinner is enjoyable, but for a morning pot the sweetness‑leaning profile and heavy finish make it hard to come back for refills.",
        "source_5": "I only judge it on flavor in cold brew, and this shines there. I did a 16‑hour steep in the fridge, medium‑coarse grind, and the result tasted like a coconut macaroon with a silky finish and no harsh edges. Over ice with a splash of half‑and‑half, the coconut is clear without turning candy‑like, and it kept that creamy note even after sitting on my desk for an hour."
