        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for cold brew, and it really shines over ice. I drop two bags into a 20 oz mason jar, fill with filtered water, and let it sit in the fridge overnight. The next day it pours clean and crisp with a clear anise note that doesn’t get bitter, and it holds up well even after the ice melts a bit. When I tried it hot out of curiosity, the flavor turned heavy and syrupy, so I stick to iced pitchers now.",
        "source_2": "I brew herbal teas hot at around 205°F for 4 minutes, and with this one the licorice takes over in a way that coats my tongue. There’s a lingering, numbing sweetness and the spices barely peek through unless I push the steep time shorter, which then makes it feel thin. Lemon didn’t help; honey pushed it into candy territory. I couldn’t finish a full mug without diluting it.",
        "source_3": "I grabbed the 100-bag box for the office thinking it would last, but each 12 oz mug needs two bags to avoid a watery cup. The licorice shows up fine with a single bag, yet the spice comes off faint unless I double up. At two bags per brew, the box feels more like 50 servings, so the big count isn’t the value I expected.",
        "source_4": "This has become my afternoon ritual. One bag in about 10 oz of hot water for 3–4 minutes gives me a rounded cup where the licorice is clear and the cinnamon/clove warmth sits underneath. I’ve also done a quick flash chill—brew strong, pour over ice—and it keeps its character without turning harsh. A squeeze of orange brightens it nicely, and the large box means I’m not constantly reordering.",
        "source_5": "The box is generous, but the packaging let me down. The bags are loose inside a larger pouch, and a handful arrived with tiny seams split, so I ended up with sediment in my mug. A couple of tags detached when I pulled them out, which made fishing the bags out awkward. The aroma on some sachets felt muted compared to the first few I opened.",
        "source_6": "I’m an herbal tea person, but I usually prefer licorice as a background note. Here it sits front and center and hangs on for minutes after each sip. My partner, who is all about black jelly beans, drained a whole iced pitcher without blinking, while my hot cup felt more like dessert than a daily drinker. The spice finally shows up late, but I set the box aside after a week and passed it to a friend who likes bolder anise."
