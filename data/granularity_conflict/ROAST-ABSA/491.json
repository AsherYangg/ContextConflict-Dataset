        "source_1": "I booked Hotel Colomba for a quick weekend and left feeling like I’d stumbled on a small city retreat. The tiny elevator took us up to a hallway lined with framed sketches of Florence, and the front desk offered a map and a couple of dinner tips without any fuss. Our room wasn’t huge, but it was tidy, the shower water pressure was steady, and the mattress didn’t sag after two nights. We walked everywhere, slept without interruptions, and I ended up sending the link to two friends planning spring trips.",
        "source_2": "I’m only commenting on the elevator at Colomba: it’s the old cage-style kind that fits two people or one person with a larger suitcase, not both. With our family of four, we had to do multiple runs and it paused at each floor like it needed a breath. My dad felt cramped and chose the stairs, which are narrow and spiral. It works, but plan extra time when checking out with luggage.",
        "source_3": "What stood out for me was the way the staff handled small moments. At check-in, Lucia greeted us by name before I pulled out my ID, circled three gelato spots on a paper map, and called a nearby trattoria to hold a table when we hesitated. The next morning she remembered we had an early tour and set aside two croissants and a bottle of water so we wouldn’t skip breakfast. When we left, the night porter jogged down with a scarf I’d forgotten on the sofa.",
        "source_4": "As an overall stay, Colomba felt like a calm pocket off a busy street. The lounge had leafy plants and soft lamps, and in the evenings we’d sit with a glass of wine and recap the day while the front desk answered other guests’ questions. Breakfast was straightforward—fresh bread, fruit, yogurt—and the coffee wasn’t burnt or watery. Checkout took two minutes, and they called a taxi that arrived in under five. I’d pick this place again over a big-chain option.",
        "source_5": "Just focusing on nighttime noise: our room faced the inner courtyard and you could hear the clink of plates and low conversation from the trattoria next door around 10–11 pm. It tapered off by about midnight, but if you’re light-sensitive to sound, consider asking for a room away from the courtyard or bring earplugs. Mornings were quiet aside from the soft rumble of the elevator.",
        "source_6": "If you’re debating Colomba, my experience tipped me strongly toward recommending it. We felt looked after from the moment the tiny lift opened to the lobby—offered a city map, help with dinner reservations, and even a late-night tea when we came back tired. The location put us within ten minutes of the Duomo, and on departure they waved us off with an espresso to go. I’d choose it again without hesitation and tell others to give it a try."
