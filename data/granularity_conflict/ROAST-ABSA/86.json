    "question": "Summarize the following evidence in 2-3 sentences.",

        "source_1": "I enrolled mainly to firm up terminology, and I was surprised at how many definitions were already embedded. In Week 1, the “Nutrient Density” lecture spelled out nutrient-dense as nutrient-to-calorie ratio with examples like spinach versus soda, and the slide literally had the formula on it. Week 3’s segment on metabolic syndrome broke down the criteria (waist circumference, HDL, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting glucose) and contrasted it with the broader phrase “metabolic abnormalities.” There was also a two-page PDF glossary under Resources that I downloaded and used during the quizzes. For me, the terminology didn’t require extra materials beyond what was provided.",
        "source_2": "My experience was all about the video presentation, and it made studying harder than it needed to be. The audio levels jumped between clips, so I was constantly adjusting volume; some segments had a faint hiss and others clipped on consonants. Several lectures felt like the professor was reading dense bullets off slides, and the screen capture stuttered when graphs were animated. Captions lagged by a couple of seconds on multiple lessons in Week 2, which threw off note-taking. By the time I reached the “Food Evolution in the U.S.” module, the lighting had changed mid-lecture, and the quick cutaways to stock images didn’t add much context.",
        "source_3": "As an overall impression after finishing all four weeks, the course fit neatly into my schedule and influenced my routine. The grocery-store audit assignment pushed me to read labels more carefully; I started swapping my usual granola bars for options with fewer added sugars after using the checklist provided. The case study on breakfast patterns led me to prep overnight oats instead of boxed cereal, and the portion-size activity helped me adjust my lunch servings. I spent about 3–4 hours per week, used the transcript search to jump back to sections I wanted to revisit, and the weekly practice quizzes kept me on track.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the course as a whole, the structure didn’t come together for me. The timeline of how U.S. food policy changed was sliced into short pieces and scattered across weeks, so I never felt a coherent thread; I kept pausing to build my own outline to see how corn subsidies and dietary guidelines connected to the later supermarket examples. Quizzes leaned on small wording differences, with multiple “select all that apply” items that hinged on terms briefly mentioned once. I finished the peer-reviewed assignment and passed, but the stop-start flow and emphasis on minutiae made the journey feel more like hoop-jumping than learning.",
        "source_5": "I focused on the “applicable to daily life” angle and struggled because I’m outside the U.S. The label-reading section centered on FDA requirements and “added sugars” formatting that doesn’t appear on products here in Mumbai, so the shopping checklist didn’t line up with our packaging. The grocery case studies referenced U.S.-specific brands and serving sizes, and the MyPlate comparisons didn’t map cleanly to local staples like poha or dal-rice plates. I tried to adapt the suggestions, but without examples using regional foods or our labeling rules, the takeaways didn’t translate to my kitchen.",
        "source_6": "I came in with a basic nutrition background and was hoping for fresh insights, but the content depth stayed introductory. Energy balance was presented at a surface level, macronutrients were covered with broad strokes, and fiber was split into soluble versus insoluble without getting into fermentability or impacts on the microbiome beyond a sentence or two. The “metabolic abnormalities” sections didn’t reference primary studies or mechanisms beyond the general risk-factor overview. If you’re new to the topic, the summaries are clear; if you’ve already worked through an undergrad health course, most of this repeats familiar ground."
