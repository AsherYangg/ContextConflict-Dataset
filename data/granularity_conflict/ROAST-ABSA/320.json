        "source_1": "Picked this up during the festival sale for 19,999 and the box even had a pair of OnePlus earbuds at no extra cost. The phone feels light enough to use one-handed, and the matte back doesn’t smudge easily. In the first week I ran into two hiccups: the 5G icon kept flipping to 4G in my apartment and the charge would sometimes stall around 87%. After a small OTA (about 320 MB) and a network reset, both issues disappeared for me. Now it charges to full before my morning coffee is done, and Signal/YouTube run without a stutter on my commute. Photos look punchy right out of the gallery—sunsets pop and food shots look brighter than the restaurant lighting. I also rely on the built-in voice-to-text subtitles when watching lectures on mute; it keeps up well with accents. For what I paid, this feels like a steal under 20k.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on 5G: I use an Airtel 5G Plus SIM in Hyderabad (Lingampally side). Indoors, the phone constantly hops between NR and LTE—speed tests swing from ~280 Mbps on the balcony to 0–5 Mbps in the living room, and WhatsApp calls fall back to LTE mid-call. The same SIM in my older handset holds 5G longer in the exact spots. Tried all the usual tweaks (preferred 5G, disabled the second SIM, reset APNs, even toggled VoNR). No luck. Outdoors it screams, but once I step inside a mall or my office, it gets flaky enough that I’ve started forcing LTE to stay sane.",
        "source_3": "Only about charging: Using the bundled cable and brick, I timed several sessions—15% to 100% in about 62–65 minutes, consistently. The last few percent trickle in slowly, but there’s no random pausing, no “charging stopped” prompts, and the back stays just warm (peaks around 38–39°C by my thermometer). I also tried an Anker cable one evening and saw the same behavior. Overnight I set the 80% cap and it respects it every time. Whatever charging glitches others reported, I haven’t run into them.",
        "source_4": "Camera processing notes: The phone auto-enhances images as soon as they hit the gallery. Street photos look cleaner and skies get a deeper blue, which is great for quick sharing. But faces can swing plasticky under indoor lighting, and fine text on posters sometimes looks over-sharpened with haloing. I couldn’t find a straightforward toggle to disable the enhancement in the default camera app; third-party apps tone it down but then you lose some of the boosted dynamic range. Great for food and scenery, a bit iffy for natural skin tones unless you shoot in good daylight.",
        "source_5": "Overall take after two weeks: The compact size and grippy frame make it easy to carry, and the live captions for videos are a lifesaver on the metro when I keep audio muted. Photos get that instant “Instagram-ready” look without editing, and the free OnePlus earbuds made the unboxing feel special. But the day-to-day reality was less smooth—5G dropped to LTE in my office several times a day, and twice the charging progress froze until I replugged. Those small stumbles added up for me, so I ended up exchanging it, even though the feature set under 20k is hard to argue with."
