        "source_1": "I bought this mainly for the camera. Over the past month I filmed my toddler running in the park and a bike ride on cobblestones; the footage looks steady without that jelly wobble I’ve seen on cheaper phones. 4K 30 fps clips hold detail in tree leaves and brick textures, and indoor photos keep faces clean without mush. Night mode balances bright shop signs with darker streets without blowing highlights. For my use, the camera has been reliable for both video and stills.",
        "source_2": "Battery life has been better than I expected. With two email accounts syncing, about two hours of YouTube, an hour of Maps with GPS, and constant Bluetooth to earbuds, I end the day around 25–30%. Screen-on time sits near 6–7 hours at 60% brightness, and standby drain overnight is about 2–3%. A quick top-up on the 33W charger takes it from roughly 15% to 80% in around 40 minutes. I’ve stopped carrying a power bank to the office.",
        "source_3": "Using this as my daily driver, the interface feels responsive and app switching is snappy. I can keep Slack, Chrome with ~10 tabs, Spotify, and Maps in memory without reloads, which tells me the 8 GB RAM is managed well. After a 30‑minute video call and some photos, the back gets warm but not uncomfortable; the thermal app usually shows 36–38°C. The 120 Hz option makes scrolling fluid, and the LCD looks well tuned out of the box with neutral whites. At the sale price I paid, it seems like a fair package for the features.",
        "source_4": "I’m picky about displays because of eye strain. This LCD has been easy on my eyes with reading mode and DC dimming turned on; I can read Kindle for an hour at night without a headache. Colors look natural in the sRGB profile, and text is crisp at 1080p. Sunlight legibility is fine on auto-brightness during midday walks. The high refresh setting keeps long article scrolling smooth.",
        "source_5": "After two weeks, the phone struggles with routine stuff like switching between the camera and Instagram; there’s a noticeable pause and occasional stutter. Casual video recording while walking looks shaky, and the device climbs to 42–44°C during a 20‑minute commute with music streaming and maps in the background. Battery drops from full to the mid‑60s by early evening on 4G, and the screen’s contrast looks washed next to my older AMOLED. The only thing I consistently enjoy is the smoothness of the 90/120 Hz setting, and the introductory price wasn’t outrageous, but I’ve had to adjust my expectations."
