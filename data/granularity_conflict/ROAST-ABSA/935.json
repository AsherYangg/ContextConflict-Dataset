        "source_1": "I only tested the breakfast during my stay, and it wasn’t a win for me. The buffet closed at 11:00, so I had to rush down at 10:45 and found the hot items already drying out—scrambled eggs on the lukewarm side and bacon that had been sitting too long. The pastries looked fine, but the cappuccino was an extra charge on top of the buffet price, which ran just over 20 euros per person. The next morning I skipped it and grabbed a fresh croissant and coffee at a bakery off Leidseplein for a fraction of the cost, with no clock watching.",
        "source_2": "I stayed four nights and was happy with the overall experience. Check-in took less than five minutes, and I snagged a midweek rate that felt fair for the area. My twin room on the fourth floor had blackout curtains, a rain shower, an iron and board, and a small minibar. I ordered a club sandwich from room service around 9 pm and it arrived in about 25 minutes, neatly plated with condiments. The location was the standout—two minutes to the trams at Leidseplein, easy rides to the museum quarter and Central Station, and tons of dinner options within a short walk. Checkout at noon gave me enough time to pack without stress.",
        "source_3": "I booked purely for the location and spent most of the trip outside. From the front door it’s a two-minute walk to Leidseplein, with lines 1, 2, and 5 getting me to the museums and the station without transfers. Daytime access is a dream, but Saturday night brought a wave of street noise and late-night chatter; the windows dulled it but didn’t eliminate it. I asked for a courtyard-facing room for the second night and slept better. If your plans revolve around shows at Paradiso or nearby bars, being right there is incredibly convenient.",
        "source_4": "My focus was room service because I landed late and needed something simple. The menu ran until midnight; I called at 11:40 and the staff still took my order—tomato soup and a club sandwich. The call was answered quickly, the food arrived at 12:10, and the soup was hot rather than lukewarm, which I appreciated at that hour. The server set the tray carefully and offered to return for pickup; when I called later, they came within ten minutes. No hassle, clear communication, and everything matched the descriptions on the menu.",
        "source_5": "I’m picky about room layout, and the twin room felt compact. The two single beds were close together with a narrow gap, leaving limited space to walk around. The desk was shallow, fine for a laptop but tight if you spread out papers, and the suitcase rack tucked under the TV meant only one big bag could sit open at a time. The wardrobe had six hangers and no drawers, so I ended up living out of the suitcase. The bathroom was spotless but snug, with just enough counter space for a dopp kit. Not a dealbreaker, but it took a bit of choreography for two people.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take, the hotel delivers the standard four-star setup—muted colors, marble in the lobby, a small gym with a couple of treadmills and free weights. During my visit the sauna was out of service, and early check-in carried a fee, which added to the bill. Breakfast wrapping at 11 meant I kept missing it after late nights around Leidseplein; I peeked next door at the NH and its bar felt more lively, with a brighter design. If you value a classic vibe and a central base, this place fits; if you want a younger mood and don’t mind a similar price point, the NH might be the better match."
