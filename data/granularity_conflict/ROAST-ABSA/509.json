        "source_1": "I only cared about how it tastes, so I did a blind test with my partner: Essentia 9.5, Brita-filtered tap, and a generic spring water, all chilled to the same temperature. I labeled the cups A/B/C and swapped them between rounds. Most of the time I couldn’t reliably pick Essentia out; on one round I guessed it was the generic because it had a faint sweetness, but when I repeated the test warm (left on the counter for an hour) the Essentia sample picked up a slight bottle note that gave it away. Ice-cold, it goes down smoothly and doesn’t feel chalky. Warm, I noticed a flat aftertaste. If your goal is a distinct flavor profile, I didn’t find one, except that it seems more sensitive to temperature than my filtered tap.",
        "source_2": "I wanted to try alkaline water without dropping thousands on a Kangen unit. I grabbed a case of Essentia for a month and used it for morning runs and after dinner. By week two, my usual post-meal throat burn settled down, and I stopped reaching for antacids at night. It’s also convenient for the gym—I keep two bottles in the fridge and rotate them so they’re always cold. The bottles fit the car cup holder and don’t rattle around. Price-wise, buying by the case brings it to about a buck a bottle at my warehouse club, which beats the boutique brands. I still keep a pitcher filter at home, but when I’m traveling or testing how my stomach reacts, these bottles make it easy without investing in a machine.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on the packaging: the plastic is on the thin side, and I learned the hard way not to leave it in a hot trunk. After a 90-minute grocery run in July, I cracked one open and caught a plasticky odor that wasn’t there when stored in the fridge. The bottle also makes that crinkle noise when you grip it, and one cap didn’t thread cleanly—leaked in my backpack and dampened a book. For home use, I keep them in a shaded cabinet or the fridge and it’s fine. If you’re buying by the case, just plan storage out of heat. From an eco angle, I feel guilty tossing so many empties, even though they’re recyclable, so I’ve started refilling a stainless bottle and only using the original for refills a few times before recycling.",
        "source_4": "I ran a little DIY comparison because I already have RO water. Using pH strips and a handheld meter, Essentia consistently read around 9.2–9.4 for me; TDS hovered in the 40–60 ppm range. My RO water alone sits at pH ~6.6 with TDS under 20. I added two drops of Trace Minerals and a squeeze of lemon to 24 oz, stirred, and the pH bumped to ~8.7–8.9 with TDS ~80–90. In terms of mouthfeel, the DIY mix felt just as smooth. Cost-wise, my mix came to maybe five cents per 24 oz versus a dollar for the bottled. For someone already comfortable fiddling with drops, getting close to the claimed effect wasn’t hard. I still grab Essentia for convenience on road trips, but day to day I can replicate the experience well enough with what I have.",
        "source_5": "Zeroing in on electrolytes only: I checked the label and then compared it to what I use for long rides. The listed electrolytes are mainly for taste, not the kind of dosing you get from tablets. On a 40-mile bike ride, two bottles didn’t keep calf twinges at bay the way a single electrolyte tab in plain water does. For shorter sessions—like a 30-minute treadmill run—it’s perfectly fine and sits well in the stomach. If you’re expecting it to replace targeted sodium/potassium intake for endurance, it didn’t do that for me. I ended up carrying one Essentia for the start because it’s easy on the gut, then switching to my usual bottle with a measured tab once the sweating ramps up.",
        "source_6": "As an overall take after three weeks: it’s a convenient way to test the alkaline-water idea without buying a countertop device. I went through a case and paid attention to energy levels, post-workout soreness, and digestion. I didn’t notice any dramatic changes compared to my filtered tap, aside from liking how cold bottles are grab-and-go for errands. The biggest tradeoff for me is cost and plastic waste; at roughly $1 per 20 oz locally, it adds up compared to refilling a stainless bottle. I keep a couple on hand for flights and road trips because airport fountains are hit-or-miss, but at home I drift back to my filter and occasionally add mineral drops if I want that smoother feel."
