        "source_1": "After a month of rotating through sample packs on a Keurig K-Classic, this is the one I keep reaching for most mornings. On the 8 oz setting (no “strong” button on this model), it pours with a glossy crema-like top and a deep aroma that reminds me of the cup I get at the corner diner. The body feels substantial without turning muddy, and there’s a faint caramel edge that shows up even when I drink it black. I’ve brewed it alongside a few dark “extra bold” options and it doesn’t tip into that ashy territory; it behaves more like a fuller medium. I keep a backup box in the pantry because we go through it fast when family visits—everyone recognizes that unfussy, sit-at-the-counter vibe.",
        "source_2": "Focusing just on sweetness: the description hints at a slight sweetness, but on my K-Elite with filtered water at 8 oz, the cup leans more toward unsweetened cocoa than any sugarcane or caramel note. Even with a preheat and a fresh pod, I don’t pick up that “just a bit sweet” angle unless I drop the volume to 6 oz, which concentrates things enough to give a faint molasses whisper. At 10 oz, any trace of sweetness disappears entirely for me.",
        "source_3": "Zeroing in on mouthfeel only: the texture in my cup is heavy, almost syrup-like, and it coats my tongue in a way that lingers between sips. On the 6 oz setting it feels thick to the point of sticking, and at 8 oz it’s still weighty compared to lighter breakfast blends I usually drink. I tried stretching it to 10 oz to thin it out, but then the body collapses and the cup turns hollow, leaving the same clingy finish without the balance I want.",
        "source_4": "Looking at the overall cup, I went in hoping for a classic medium roast that would echo the simple, smooth diner mug. What I get on my K-Duo—6, 8, and 10 oz trials, with and without the “strong” option—is a darker profile with a smoky edge and a charred aftertaste that hangs around even with a splash of half-and-half. It doesn’t match the clean, easygoing profile I associate with a breakfast counter pour; instead it pushes into roasty territory I usually find in bold dark blends. After a week of trying different settings, I ended up passing the remainder to a friend who prefers that kind of intensity.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing in on consistency: out of a 24-count box, three pods brewed noticeably flat on my K-Elite—muted aroma from the start and a cup that tasted like it had been sitting open in the pantry. One pod leaked grounds into the mug, and a handful felt puffed under the lid before brewing. Using the same machine and water, other brands don’t vary this much. With these, the 8 oz strong button sometimes produces a rich cup and other times tastes watered down, which makes it hard to dial in a reliable morning routine."
