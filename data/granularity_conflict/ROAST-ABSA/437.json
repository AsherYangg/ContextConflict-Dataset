        "source_1": "I’m mostly about the aroma, since I grind right before brewing. The moment I cracked the seal on this vanilla coffee, the scent blasted out like I’d opened a bottle of baking extract. During brewing, the kitchen smelled like a scented candle shop, and the fragrance hung in the air for hours. In the cup, that same perfume-like note sat on the steam, distracting from the coffee smell I usually enjoy from a fresh medium roast.",
        "source_2": "I tested the flavor strength over three mornings with a Kalita Wave at a 1:16 ratio, Baratza Encore set to 18–20. Even when I bumped up to a heaping scoop and extended the bloom, the vanilla note was barely there—tasted like a regular medium roast unless I added a splash of vanilla syrup. Tried a French press with two tablespoons per 8 oz and got a fuller body, but the flavoring still registered more as a whisper than an actual vanilla character.",
        "source_3": "Over two weeks I brewed this both in a basic drip machine and as a V60. The cup stays smooth from first sip to last, and the vanilla rides along without covering up the coffee itself. No harsh edges, and it pairs nicely with a small dash of milk; the aftertaste clears quickly so I can pour a second mug without palate fatigue. The bag went fast in my house, and I already put another in my cart.",
        "source_4": "First mug out of the drip maker felt silky going down, but halfway through the cup a syrupy aftertaste started to cling to my tongue, and it stuck around long after I finished. Reheated leftovers were worse—the steam carried a sweet, candle-like smell that my partner noticed from across the room. I poured out the rest of the pot and won’t be ordering another bag.",
        "source_5": "I ran it through my espresso setup (Barista Express, 18 g in, 36 g out, ~28 seconds) and the vanilla oils seemed to gum up the hopper and leave a sticky film in the chute. As straight shots, the flavoring sat heavy and muddled the crema; in a cappuccino it dominated the cup even with only a teaspoon of sugar. Switching to cold brew (1:5 concentrate steeped 14 hours) toned it down, but the vanilla still overshadowed the coffee’s own notes."
