        "source_1": "I bought these specifically to see if the lemon would help with post-lunch breath. I ate a whole 3.75 oz tin with crackers before a client call and didn’t reach for gum. The lemon slice actually perfumes the fillets, and the lemony brine seems to rinse away the lingering odor that I usually get from sardines. I’ve repeated this a few times at the office and haven’t had coworkers edge away during conversations, which is my usual tell.",
        "source_2": "Strictly on texture and packing liquid: every can I opened was flooded with thin lemony brine, and the fillets collapsed when I tried to lift them out with a fork. On toast, they smeared like pâté instead of staying in neat pieces. I even chilled a tin to firm them up and they still broke apart. One can had a few flaky scale bits that crunched unpleasantly.",
        "source_3": "As an overall pantry staple, these have worked out well for me. The pull-tab opens cleanly, the fillets arrive intact, and the smell is clean when the lid comes off. I appreciate the “BPA-free lining” notice on the can and the claim that the fish are from U.S. waters, even though the can says they’re packed in Asia. The lemon slice is a nice touch over rice or a salad, and the extra liquid makes quick pasta sauces without needing extra oil.",
        "source_4": "I’m fixated on sourcing, so I’m only commenting on that. The front label mentions domestic catch, but the country-of-origin statement on the back reads “Product of Thailand,” and the FAO catch area code is missing. I emailed the brand and was told the fish are landed in the U.S. and shipped frozen to be canned overseas. That long trip and the lack of a clear catch area code makes me question the “domestic” angle.",
        "source_5": "I bought these for the BPA-free packaging claim. The cans are clearly labeled, but there’s no third-party certification mark, just a small “BPA-NI” note near the nutrition panel. I heated some of the lemon brine in a saucepan to see if any tinny taste showed up—it did carry a faint metallic note compared to a glass-jar brand I use. One tin arrived slightly dented along the seam, which made me nervous about storing spares in the pantry.",
        "source_6": "Big-picture impression after five tins: the lemon slice looks nice, but it doesn’t cut through the fishiness for me. The liquid is plentiful, yet it waters down the flavor when mixed into pasta. The bones are soft enough to eat but crumble and leave gritty bits in a sandwich. Compared to a Spanish brand I rotate in, these come off a little flat, and the canned-in-Asia processing step is a turnoff for weeknight meals."
