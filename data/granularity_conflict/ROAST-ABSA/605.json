        "source_1": "I picked up a bag of Chewlotta after seeing a display that promised extended chew time. My 75‑lb lab knocked back three bars over a movie night, and we were scraping the bottom of the bag in under two hours. He was thrilled every time I reached for the bag, and there wasn’t any greasy residue on the rug or tummy issues afterward. As a quick pre‑walk reward they work, but they don’t buy me a full evening of quiet with a power chewer. The shelf price at my local pet store was higher than the bulk bully sticks I usually grab, so the cost hit harder given how fast they disappeared.",
        "source_2": "Strictly on price: I tracked what I pay for Chewlotta over three months. Singles at the boutique shop are $3 each, while the bag of 12 on Amazon swings between $14.99 and $18.99 depending on the week. My beagle gets about 20 minutes from a bar, so I’m staring at roughly $4 per hour of chew time, which beats yak chews in my area but loses to braided bully sticks that run closer to $2 per hour. When the bag dips to $12 on sale, I stock up; at the higher end, I wait it out.",
        "source_3": "I did a timing test because I only care about how long Chewlotta keeps dogs busy. One stick lasts 50 minutes with my 12‑lb terrier and almost 90 minutes with my 6‑lb chihuahua, both steady nibblers. I handed the same bar to my neighbor’s 80‑lb pit mix and it vanished in about 10 minutes—pure jaw strength. Compared to the rawhide chips I used to buy (20 minutes max here), Chewlotta stretches the session for small dogs. If you’re shopping for a heavy chewer, plan for faster turnover; for toy breeds, a single bar covers a full TV episode.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, Chewlotta fits our routine surprisingly well. The resealable bag keeps the bars from drying out, there’s no strong odor, and my shepherd doesn’t leave sharp shards on the floor. We give one before we head to the grocery store and it keeps him settled for roughly an hour. A bag of eight carries us through a typical week with two or three errands. Price-wise, it lands between rawhide and yak in my area, so it doesn’t feel out of place in the cart.",
        "source_5": "I’m focusing on flavor and digestion here. My spaniel spins circles when he hears the Chewlotta bag crinkle, and he licks the last bits off the kitchen tile like it’s a smear of peanut butter. No gas, no soft stools, and no midnight trips outside—important after a bad bully stick episode last month. I don’t track how long they last or compare cost; I use them as a bedtime wind‑down because they calm him without any stomach drama.",
        "source_6": "I needed a road‑trip chew and tried Chewlotta on my 50‑lb hound. One stick kept him occupied for close to four hours with breaks, which surprised me given his usual pace with rawhide. There wasn’t a mess in the back seat, and the scent didn’t overwhelm the car. I grabbed the bag at $16 and didn’t blink at the price after it covered an afternoon on the interstate. For our use case—long drives and waiting room visits—it does exactly what I need."
