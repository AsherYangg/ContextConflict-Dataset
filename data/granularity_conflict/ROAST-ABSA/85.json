        "source_1": "I picked up these Hot Cocoa K-cups so I’d have something to sip while coworkers brew their afternoon coffee. On the 6 oz setting the cup comes out rich and chocolatey, and a quick stir with a spoon keeps any residue off the bottom. I add a splash of milk when I want it creamier, and it’s ready in under a minute with no saucepan to clean. It’s become my go-to warm drink at home and at the office.",
        "source_2": "Breaking down the cost, my 24-pack was $18.99 after tax, which is roughly 79 cents a mug. A grocery-store tin runs me about $4.50 and makes around 30 cups—call it 15 cents each—and takes maybe 20 seconds to stir. The pods are tidy, but that price gap adds up fast for a nightly drink. I’ll finish this box, but the next refill is coming from a canister.",
        "source_3": "Focusing just on flavor: on the standard 8 oz pour, the result tastes like lightly tinted hot water. I had to drop to 6 oz and add milk to keep it from feeling thin, and even then there’s a faint chalky finish. If the mug sits for a minute, a slick film forms on top that I end up skimming with a spoon. I wanted a deeper cocoa note and didn’t find it.",
        "source_4": "I went through the whole sleeve hoping it would be a cozy evening treat, but it didn’t quite land. The aroma is inviting, yet the sip leans sugary with a flat cocoa note, and my kids left half their mugs more than once. Convenience is great—button, brew, done—but I’ve gone back to whisking cocoa on the stovetop because it feels more satisfying. There are still six pods lingering in the pantry.",
        "source_5": "Strictly on price: I grabbed two 24-packs during a lightning deal at $11.99 each, so about 50 cents per cup. That’s less than what we pay for our coffee pods and miles cheaper than the café downstairs. With Subscribe & Save it dips a little more, which fits our family’s weekly hot drink routine. I’m judging this purchase purely on cost versus alternatives."
