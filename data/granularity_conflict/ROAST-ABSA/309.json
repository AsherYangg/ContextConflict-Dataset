        "source_1": "I’ve tried a few blue lotus extracts, and this one stands out for evening use. I’m a non-drinker, but two small capfuls straight around 8 p.m. eased me into a calm evening within twenty minutes. The liquid is dark amber with a light floral note; not syrupy, no weird aftereffects. After a week of using it three nights in a row, I fell asleep faster and woke up clear. For me it replaced my nighttime tea.",
        "source_2": "Just about the taste: it comes across hot and medicinal at first sip, with a bitter, lingering finish. I diluted 1 cap in 6 oz of water, then tried honey and lemon, and the sharpness still dominated. My tongue felt slightly numb for a minute. If you’re picky about flavor, this isn’t a dessert-like profile.",
        "source_3": "Across ten days I tested doses from 1 ml up to 5 ml, sublingual and in chamomile, afternoon and late evening. I kept a journal—no change in mood, no easier sleep, just a warm throat from the alcohol base and one mild headache. Half the bottle gone and the effect feels absent. I’ll stick with brewing the dried petals, which at least give me a noticeable shift.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on the effect: two full droppers under the tongue on an empty stomach, and at the 15-minute mark my shoulders dropped and background tension dialed down. The relaxed state held for about an hour and a half, then gently faded, and I was able to read without mind-wandering. No grogginess on waking.",
        "source_5": "As someone who avoids alcohol, the ethanol sting is front and center. Taking it neat felt like a small shot; I had to chase with apple juice. Mixing 1 cap with 4–5 oz of juice made it tolerable, but it still left a warm burn in the throat. If this came in a glycerin base, it would suit me better.",
        "source_6": "I liked it enough to put a bottle in my sister’s care package. She works 12-hour shifts, and half a cap after dinner helped her settle before bed. I’ve since told two coworkers who deal with late-night restlessness to start with a small amount and see how it fits their routine."
