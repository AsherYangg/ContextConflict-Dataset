        "source_1": "Coming from a Pixel 6, I actually measured a few things on the iPhone 13 (iOS 17.5) because I wanted to be sure about speed. Cold‑opening Mail averages about 1.2 seconds versus 1.6 on the Pixel, and exporting a 24‑photo batch in Lightroom took 2:03 on the iPhone compared with 2:41 on my old device. Multitasking on my commute, I can jump between Maps, Spotify, and Messages without any app refreshing, and scrolling X with lots of GIFs stays smooth at 120 Hz. Even big games like Genshin load to the title screen faster for me by a noticeable margin.",
        "source_2": "I bought the phone for the camera, and indoors it hasn’t matched what I was hoping for. In my living room at night, portraits give my kid a waxy look and blow out the lamp behind him, and 3x zoom shots of the dog turn into watercolor when I crop them. In a dim restaurant, menus come out yellowish and noisy compared with my partner’s Galaxy S21, which kept text crisp. Daylight is fine, but as soon as the light drops, I end up taking two or three shots to get one I like.",
        "source_3": "I rely on a few niche Android apps for work, and the switch has been awkward. My office VPN client doesn’t support split tunneling on iOS, so I can’t stream Spotify while connected, and the call recorder I used for interviews doesn’t exist here at all. Even simple things are different: my bank’s app on iOS won’t let me add the NFC transit card that worked on my old OnePlus, and moving files between a USB drive and the phone requires the clunky Files app instead of a real file manager. None of this is a deal‑breaker by itself, but together it slows me down every day.",
        "source_4": "I set up a FaceTime link for my parents, who use Android, and it’s been painless. I tap New FaceTime, create a link, and share it through WhatsApp; it takes maybe ten seconds, and the link keeps working for future calls. My mom joins from Chrome on her Moto G without installing anything, and the call quality has been steadier than our old WhatsApp video chats on the same Wi‑Fi. We now have the link pinned in a family chat, so nobody has to fiddle with settings each time.",
        "source_5": "After a month with the iPhone 14, I’ve settled into a routine and it’s been a dependable daily driver. The phone cruises through Slack, Gmail, and Lightroom, and I can go from 7 a.m. to bedtime with around 25–30% left without babying it. Photos in daylight have pleasing color and skin tones, and the ultra‑wide has been handy on hikes. I did miss a couple of Android conveniences like call recording and a more open file system, but all my core apps installed fine, tap‑to‑pay works everywhere I shop, and the Watch unlock for my Mac has quietly saved me time."
