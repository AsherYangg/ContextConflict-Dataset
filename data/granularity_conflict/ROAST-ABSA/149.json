        "source_1": "I keep a bottle of this on the counter and it ends up in most weeknight meals. I rub it on chicken thighs before air-frying, toss it with olive oil and fingerling potatoes, and even whisk a pinch into yogurt for a quick sauce. At a family cookout I dusted it over skirt steak and grilled corn; everyone kept asking what I used, and nobody reached for the salt shaker. I went through two jars in three weeks, so the four-pack made sense for us.",
        "source_2": "Zooming in on the salt-free part: on plain foods like white rice or scrambled eggs, the lack of salt stands out. The aroma is there—garlic and paprika come through—but the bite tastes flat until I add a sprinkle of kosher salt. On chicken breasts I season with this and then still need to salt separately to get the flavor to pop.",
        "source_3": "Strictly about the 4-pack: I misjudged how quickly we’d use it, and the extra jars crowded my small pantry. By the time I opened the third bottle, the fragrance had faded compared to the first, even though the date was still far off. I’d rather buy a single larger jar or individual bottles as needed than store four small ones.",
        "source_4": "Focusing only on flavor intensity: a teaspoon per pound of ground beef turns the mix bright orange and dominates everything else in the pan. On cod and steamed rice it steamrolls the delicate flavors; on a hot grill the paprika browns fast and can taste bitter if I’m not careful. It works better for me in tiny amounts, like a pinch in a vinaigrette, than as a rub.",
        "source_5": "After a month of trying it on chicken, beef fajitas, roasted veggies, and a pilaf, it hasn’t become an “everything” seasoning in our house. My kids like a dusting on fries, but my partner finds it too garlicky for breakfast potatoes. I still have most of my first jar left, and I reach for simpler blends or just salt and pepper more often."
