        "source_1": "I booked a two-night stay on a flash sale and ended up on the 8th floor with a king bed and a view over Wilcox. The lobby had soft lighting and framed old-Hollywood photos, and the hallways used patterned carpet that kept things quiet. We spent most of our time touring, but in the evenings we soaked in the hot tub for about twenty minutes. The front desk printed a walking map and marked taco trucks nearby. On the second night, a CSI crew set up right outside; they cordoned off the sidewalk and rolled cameras past midnight. We watched a scene for a bit, then went upstairs, and the blackout curtains plus double-pane windows kept noise to a level where I could sleep.",
        "source_2": "Only commenting on the pool and hot tub: at 8:15 pm the pool had around a dozen people, with several kids using inflatables. The water felt cool to the touch, maybe mid-70s, and the hot tub’s jets on the left side were weak; the timer knob stuck at about ten minutes and wouldn’t reset. The towel shelf was empty by 8:45, and it didn’t get restocked before we left at 9:20. The posted closing time said 10 pm, but staff started asking people to wrap up at about 9:35.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on staff interactions: we asked the concierge at 4 pm about studio tour tickets that showed sold out online, and he called around and got us in for a 6:30 slot. Housekeeping noticed our shampoo was out and left two replacements without us requesting them. After checkout, the bellman tagged our bags and stored them in a locked room so we could visit Griffith Observatory; pickup later took under a minute with the claim ticket. A follow-up call at 9 pm to check on our stay came while we were winding down, which caught us off guard.",
        "source_4": "As an overall impression, the room matched the photos with mid-century touches like tapered legs and brass accents, but sleep on the first night was uneven. A film crew parked generators along the curb, and the hum carried into the room until after midnight; there was a bowl of earplugs at the desk. Breakfast isn’t on-site, so we walked three blocks to a diner. Getting to LACMA and the Getty took short rideshare trips. The second night was quieter, and we used the pool for about fifteen minutes before heading out again.",
        "source_5": "Only commenting on decor and ambiance: the lobby uses amber lamps and dark wood, with low-volume jazz in the evening. Our room had textured wallpaper and a diffuser that released a floral scent periodically. After about half an hour, the fragrance triggered a headache, so I switched off the unit and propped the bathroom door open to air it out. The window only opened a few inches, which made the process slow."
