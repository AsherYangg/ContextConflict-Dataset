        "source_1": "I’ll speak only about system stability. During the first week, the phone rebooted on me twice—once while I was scrolling through Instagram and once when switching from Maps to the camera. The update screen showed a small patch arriving two days later, and after installing it I kept the device on for about 14 days straight with my usual routine (YouTube during lunch, Gmail sync, Maps navigation to work) and didn’t get another surprise restart. I even tried stressing it with a 30-minute video call plus a file download, and it held steady. So for me, the random reboot issue showed up early and then went quiet after the patch.",
        "source_2": "Accessory hunt has been rough. I visited three mobile shops near Palasia in Indore and none of them had a case or tempered glass made for this model; the shopkeepers offered a “universal” case that covered the side buttons and made screenshots a pain. I ended up ordering a branded back cover online with a promised 3–5 day delivery that landed after 9 days, and the tempered glass that arrived didn’t go edge-to-edge, leaving a thin uncovered strip where dust collects. Even the Type‑C earphones I tried had a loose connection because the cutouts didn’t align perfectly with the port and mic. If you rely on walk-in stores for accessories, be ready to compromise or wait.",
        "source_3": "As an overall take, I’ve used this as my daily driver for freelance work—Slack, Gmail, Docs, banking, and lots of calls. I typically keep 15–20 apps in the background and bounce between them while uploading photos to Drive, and the interface stays responsive; no freezes during app switching. I’ve typed long messages on the keyboard without missed taps, and gesture navigation stays fluid even with a podcast playing and Maps running. Gaming is light (Clash Royale, 20 minutes at a time), and it doesn’t stutter when a notification lands. I haven’t needed to force close anything or reboot to “refresh” it during the workday.",
        "source_4": "Sharing just my service experience: I cracked the screen and walked into the brand’s authorized center on MG Road in Kochi on a Tuesday around 11 a.m. The receptionist pulled up my IMEI, the technician checked the display and frame in about 10 minutes, and they quoted me a price and a 3–4 hour turnaround. They had the panel in stock, called me at 2:45 p.m., and I picked it up by 3:30 after a quick touch and proximity sensor test. Paperwork included a six-month parts warranty, and they updated the firmware while they were at it. No need to ship the phone out or wait a week.",
        "source_5": "Broadly speaking, my unit has been finicky since day one: it froze on the setup screen until I held the power button for a hard reboot, and over the first week it restarted during a voice call and once while opening the camera, which cost me an un-saved note. Local shops in Akola told me they don’t stock model-specific cases or screen guards; a generic case I tried covered the fingerprint sensor ring, so unlocking became hit-or-miss. When I checked the brand’s site for support, the closest listed center was in Nagpur—around a three-hour bus ride—so I put it off. I disabled a few background apps and turned off some gestures, but I still get a spontaneous reboot every couple of days, including once while browsing news over Wi‑Fi."
