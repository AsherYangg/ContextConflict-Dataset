        "source_1": "I finished the course in 10 days and treated it like a bootcamp. I tracked my reading speed using a simple log, and after applying the spacing and chunking routines from week 2, my pages-per-hour went from 18 to around 27. The instructor walks through study blocks with live demonstrations, which made it easy to copy the structure into Notion. I applied the checklist to my biology prep and shaved about 40 minutes off each session. The peer discussions were quiet but the instructor Q&A posts appeared every couple of days.",
        "source_2": "I only want to comment on captions and playback. On desktop Chrome, the captions were consistently 2–3 seconds behind the audio, and punctuation was stripped, which made technical terms run together. Switching to the mobile app fixed the delay but introduced stutter at 1.25x speed, so I ended up watching at 1.0x. Several slides were blurry at 720p; forcing 1080p helped but ate through my data plan during my commute. If you're relying on subtitles, plan for manual rewinds.",
        "source_3": "I went in curious about the promise to multiply learning speed. I completed all modules and logged my outcomes: in the month before the course, my LeetCode solve rate averaged 3 per evening; in the month after, it hovered around 3–4 with no clear jump. The frameworks felt familiar from books I’ve already read, and the examples repeated similar scenarios (language learning, exam prep) without much on creative work or coding. The community area was sparse, which meant fewer chances to compare notes. I kept the certificate but haven’t seen much traction after adding it to my LinkedIn.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing on quizzes because they shaped my pace. The week 3 quiz marked “spaced practice” wrong even though the lecture used both “spaced practice” and “spaced repetition,” so wording mattered more than concept. Several questions were timed at 60 seconds with multi-part stems, and the feedback after a miss was a single sentence with no timestamp back to the video. Retakes required an eight-hour gap, which interrupted my weekend study block. When the final graded assessment recycled earlier items, I still got docked for capitalization on a free-response.",
        "source_5": "I only evaluated the memory techniques section. I built a memory palace for anatomy terms using my apartment layout, placing muscles along the hallway and nerves in the kitchen area, and rehearsed twice daily as suggested. On a practice exam, recall of origin/insertion pairs moved from 12/20 to 17/20 over two weeks. The downloadable workbook had blank palace templates, which made planning quick. Outside that module, I didn’t explore much, so I can’t speak to the broader structure."
