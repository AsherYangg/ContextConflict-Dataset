        "source_1": "I’ve had the phone for a month, and the slowdown during basic tasks is hard to ignore. From the lock screen, the fingerprint animation sits there for 3–4 seconds before the home screen appears, and sometimes I tap twice because I think it didn’t read. Launching the stock Camera after unlock takes another few seconds, which has made me miss quick shots. Even the Messages app shows a blank pane before the conversations render, and this happens even right after a reboot with no third-party apps running.",
        "source_2": "As an everyday device, it’s been dependable for me. The screen wakes instantly with double-tap, fingerprint unlock completes in under a second, and I can jump between Gmail, Maps, and the stock Camera without hiccups. I streamed music over Bluetooth, ran a navigation session, and answered a call back-to-back with no stutters, and the preinstalled apps open as soon as I tap them.",
        "source_3": "Focusing only on the camera: the photo quality is what keeps me using this phone. Double-pressing the power button brings up the camera quickly enough to catch candid moments, and the shutter response is consistent. I shot a 15-minute 4K clip at my kid’s game without frame drops, and switching to portrait mode feels immediate.",
        "source_4": "My notes on battery life: I charge every other night with 20–30% left. Screen-on time averages around 7 hours for me (YouTube, reading, and light browsing), and standby drain overnight is about 2–3%. Even with Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, and location on, it doesn’t heat up during long calls or when tethering a laptop.",
        "source_5": "Set this up for my dad with only the stock apps, and the experience still feels sluggish. Pressing the power button shows the lock screen, but after entering the PIN there’s a pause where the screen is dark before the icons appear, sometimes as long as 5–6 seconds. The default Messages and Dialer take a beat to populate recent items, and the Camera occasionally opens to a black preview that resolves after a couple of seconds. I turned off animations and cleared cache partitions; the behavior didn’t really change."
