        "source_1": "Stayed mid-July in a king room (914). The mattress dipped on the right side, so I kept rolling toward the edge. The duvet cover had noticeable pilling near the seams, and the four pillows were all feather and flattened within minutes; housekeeping found one foam pillow but not a second. I woke with a stiff neck both mornings and ended up layering towels under a pillow the second night.",
        "source_2": "I booked because it looked close to the French Quarter, but the walk to Jackson Square took about 22 minutes with two long traffic lights and street construction on Dauphine. My mom uses a cane, and the cracked sidewalks between the hotel and Decatur slowed us down. After dinner, calling a rideshare out front was messy—valet cars lined the curb, and two drivers canceled because they couldn’t pull over on the one-way.",
        "source_3": "Double-queen on the 3rd floor facing an interior atrium. Once two suitcases were open, there wasn’t much room to move around. The AC cycled loudly every ten minutes and rattled the vent cover. Bathroom grout was chipped by the tub, and the shower temperature swung from lukewarm to suddenly hot. The window looked directly at a brick wall, so we kept the curtains closed the whole stay.",
        "source_4": "Three-night weekend in May. Check-in took under five minutes, and they texted when the room was ready early. The lobby has high ceilings with plenty of seating; I worked an hour there and the Wi‑Fi held steady. Our 8th-floor room was tidy, the bed felt supportive, and the duvet was light enough for the humid weather. We walked to Café du Monde in about 12 minutes and didn’t need a car at all. I’d book the same place again.",
        "source_5": "I care a lot about design, and the public areas felt dated. The lobby lighting ran dim with a few bulbs out on the main chandelier, and several columns had scuffed paint. Hallway carpet showed wear near the elevator landings, and the framed art looked mass-produced. In the room, the faux-leather headboard had a nicked corner, and the nightstand veneer was peeling at the edge.",
        "source_6": "I only stayed one night before a cruise and mainly needed solid sleep. The king bed in 1006 was firm without pressure points, and the pillows offered a mix of soft and supportive. The duvet cover was crisp and clean with no heavy fragrance, and the sheets stayed cool even with the thermostat set higher. I went to bed at 10 and didn’t stir until my 6 a.m. alarm."
