        "source_1": "I took this with my eighth grader and we made it part of our evening routine: two short videos after dinner (most were 8–12 minutes), then we tried one tactic on her algebra homework. The printable checklists gave us a common set of terms—retrieval practice, spaced sessions, and a 25/5 timer block—so our study talks stopped sounding like nagging and turned into planning. The calendar tool kept her pacing realistic; we slotted three blocks on Mondays and one on Thursdays around soccer. By week three she was breaking chapters into question cards instead of rereading, and we both used the same reflection sheet on Sundays to see what stuck.",
        "source_2": "I enrolled specifically for the Pomodoro segment and only watched that section. The instructor walks through setting a 25/5 rhythm, shows how to prep a task list before starting the first block, and explains what counts as a real break (standing up, water, no phone scroll). There’s a printable cycle tracker with four boxes per page; I kept it next to a kitchen timer and could chain three cycles without drifting. I didn’t go through the rest of the lectures, so I can’t comment on the broader course.",
        "source_3": "As a second‑year engineering student I was hoping for deeper material on memory systems and note schemas, but most lessons skimmed familiar advice. The quizzes felt like quick checkpoints—you can clear them fast, and wrong answers don’t come with much explanation. The “mind maps” piece is a tour rather than a build‑along, and the sample weekly plans assume a steady schedule, which didn’t translate to my rotating lab hours. Discussion boards were quiet when I posted, and two videos I tried lacked accurate transcripts. The planner PDFs are cleanly designed, but I didn’t find much I hadn’t seen before.",
        "source_4": "I’m focusing only on the assessments. The module quizzes are multiple choice with repeated items, and after a couple of retries I was seeing near‑identical questions. There’s minimal feedback after a miss—usually just a green check on the next try—which makes it hard to figure out what to adjust. The final check pulls from the same small pool, so it doesn’t really feel like a cumulative test. I hit a bug where a correct answer wouldn’t register in Module 4, so my progress stalled at 80%. I didn’t evaluate the lectures themselves.",
        "source_5": "I had my intern cohort take this alongside me so we could share a framework for learning on the job. Having common language—“spaced practice,” “interleaving,” “active recall”—made our stand‑ups more concrete because we could label what each person was trying between sprints. The Google Calendar integration worked smoothly; we blocked 3x25‑minute review slots before code reviews. Some case examples are school‑centric (midterms, vocabulary lists), so we had to translate them into debugging and API reading. The certificate flow was straightforward, and by the end we’d built a team playbook for how to approach new technologies."
