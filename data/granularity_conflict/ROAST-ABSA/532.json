        "source_1": "I’m only commenting on the battery. With Bluetooth on for calls and music, dual‑SIM 4G, and the screen around 60% brightness, I typically get 4–5 hours of screen‑on time and reach about 20% by late afternoon. After roughly a year, the health reading shows 86%. On light days, it drops about 5–7% overnight, but if I run maps for an hour or shoot a lot of video, I’m hunting for a charger by 3–4 p.m. My spouse’s newer phone under the same routine still has 40–50% at dinner, so this one feels more short‑leash when I’m out.",
        "source_2": "After a year of daily use, the phone has handled messaging, banking, and a bunch of work apps without crashing, and calls sound clear on both ends. The display hasn’t picked up scratches even without a protector, and the fingerprint reader unlocks quickly. That said, storage is tight at 64 GB once photos and WhatsApp media pile up, and the last two system updates slowed down app launches a bit. If someone is buying today, I’d steer them toward the newer releases with faster charging and 5G, but for me it still gets through the week without drama.",
        "source_3": "Focusing strictly on the camera: I shoot my kids’ soccer games every weekend, and the focus hunts when players move toward the lens, so half my bursts end up soft. Indoors, faces look smeared under warm lights, and there’s a noticeable delay between tapping the shutter and capturing, which makes candid shots tricky. Outdoors at noon, detail is fine, and stabilization keeps walk‑and‑talk clips steady, but evening street scenes show visible noise. I tried a sideloaded camera app that helped a little with HDR, though motion blur is still there.",
        "source_4": "As an overall take, the phone’s been steady. No random reboots, and the fingerprint sensor and face unlock both register quickly. I juggle Slack, Gmail, Maps, and Spotify during commutes, and it switches between apps without hiccups. Signal stays strong in my office basement where other devices drop to one bar, and call hand‑offs between Wi‑Fi and cellular don’t cut out. Battery-wise, I do a quick 20–30 minute top‑up around 5 p.m. to make it through late meetings. If the priority is dependable behavior over chasing the latest spec sheet, this fits that lane.",
        "source_5": "Narrowing in on battery and charging: after the April update, standby drain jumped—overnight it loses 15–20% with Wi‑Fi off, AOD off, and only two apps allowed in the background. Using the stock 10W brick, a full charge takes about two hours, and in summer the phone gets warm enough that I set it on a metal tray to keep temperatures down. I swapped the battery at a local service center around month 11; health went from 79% back to 100%, but the drain pattern barely changed. I now carry a small 5,000 mAh pack because navigation plus music drains it fast.",
        "source_6": "Just about the display: outdoors at noon the screen is readable, but I often push brightness to max, which nudges battery down quicker. Auto‑brightness is slow to react; walking from a dim café into sunlight leaves it under‑lit for a good 5–6 seconds. Colors skew a bit warm compared to my work monitor, and there’s faint flicker at very low brightness when scrolling dark pages. Watching movies on flights is comfortable, though, and the touch response stays consistent even with a cheap tempered‑glass protector."
