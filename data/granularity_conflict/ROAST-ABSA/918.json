        "source_1": "I took this as my first web dev course and stuck with the suggested order, moving from HTML to CSS to JavaScript with short demos and small “build” tasks; by week two I had a simple portfolio up on GitHub Pages, and the instructor’s screen shares on tags, the box model, and basic DOM events made it easy to follow along during 30‑minute lunch breaks, so I finished feeling comfortable tinkering with my own site.",
        "source_2": "Focusing only on the instructor’s delivery: the mic clips in several videos, and explanations skip steps—during the functions lesson, we jumped from a named function to an arrow function and implicit returns without any setup, so I kept pausing to look up terms because definitions and reasons for the change weren’t given before the code switched.",
        "source_3": "Only talking about course structure: topics zigzag in a way that caused rework—responsive design shows up before CSS specificity is explained, so early exercises break when media queries meet class overrides, and the project rubric references semantic tags before that module appears, which forced me to redo markup once the later lesson finally covered section/article/header.",
        "source_4": "Zeroing in on the teacher’s support: my forum questions got replies within a day, with annotated screenshots highlighting exactly where my flex container needed display: flex and justify-content, and when I posted a broken click handler, the instructor recorded a short walkthrough showing addEventListener, event.target, and scope so I could see why my variable was undefined.",
        "source_5": "Judging the course as a whole from a beginner’s seat: I passed the quizzes but stalled on the capstone because the jump from CSS layout to DOM manipulation felt abrupt—the final brief assumed comfort with querySelector, template literals, and event delegation, and I had to lean on MDN and a couple of YouTube clips to stitch the pieces together and finish.",
        "source_6": "Looking strictly at the curriculum layout: each module opens with a checklist and ends with a contained build—HTML forms one week, a responsive navbar the next, then a vanilla JS image slider—so the progression from structure to styling to interactivity made the relationships between files, selectors, and script hooks straightforward to see."
