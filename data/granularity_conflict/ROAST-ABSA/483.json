        "source_1": "My wife and I spent 9 nights at the end of September in a partial sea view room and felt comfortable from day one. The room was spotless when we arrived and stayed that way—fresh linens, no sand on the floors, and the balcony glass wiped clear. The location made our routine easy: quick coffee from the bakery next door, then a short walk across the road to the beach. There are dozens of places to eat within a few minutes, so we never repeated dinner. The pool is on the smaller side and starts to fall into shade after lunch, but it was fine for a quick cool-off. For what we paid, the stay made sense for a relaxed, car-free week by the seaside.",
        "source_2": "I’m writing only about the swimming pool, since that’s what mattered to me. I used it daily for afternoon swims and was surprised by how much sun it caught—loungers around the far edge stayed bright well into the late afternoon, and I actually tried to claim the umbrella spots to avoid getting too much. The water was clear and warm, and I could manage short laps without bumping into anyone. There were always spare loungers, and I never felt cramped.",
        "source_3": "Focusing on room cleanliness: my partial sea view room wasn’t up to scratch on arrival. There was a faint layer of dust on the bedside tables, a few long hairs in the shower, and the floor near the curtains felt gritty as if it hadn’t been mopped recently. The bathroom grout had some discoloration, and one towel had a light makeup mark. Housekeeping did come back after I reported it, which helped, but I still noticed streaks on the mirror and a musty smell from the drain the next morning.",
        "source_4": "Only commenting on the location: the beach being across the road sounds convenient, but that road is busier than it looks. Traffic noise and scooter engines carry late into the night, and the bar on the corner had music until around 1 a.m. on two nights of our stay. Crossing with our toddler and a stroller felt stressful because the cars move quickly when the light changes. We ended up walking 15 minutes down the promenade to a quieter stretch just to get away from the constant buzz.",
        "source_5": "Two of us stayed in early October and the overall experience didn’t match the price. We paid about €150 per night for a partial sea view, but most of what we saw from the balcony was a palm canopy and the roof of the neighboring building, with a sliver of water beyond. There were extra charges for the safe and beach towels, and the mini-fridge was empty. Wi‑Fi kept dropping in the evenings, and the pool, while tidy, felt more like a plunge pool in the shade rather than a place to linger. The area is handy for restaurants, but for the rate we were charged, I expected more substance from the hotel itself."
