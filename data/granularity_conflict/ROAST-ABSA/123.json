        "source_1": "I booked The Duquesne for my daughter’s sixteenth, and it worked well for a celebratory weekend. Our room on the fifth floor had a partial Eiffel Tower view; we could see the beacon sweep across the skyline at night. The front desk called the airline twice about a delayed suitcase and kept us updated, then brought it up once it arrived. Breakfast downstairs included scrambled eggs, sliced ham, cereals, and small pastries, and the staff kept refilling trays while we lingered. We walked to the Champ de Mars in about five minutes, and École Militaire station was a couple of short blocks away.",
        "source_2": "I’m focusing only on breakfast: I went down around 8:30 a.m. three days in a row, and the hot items sat lukewarm in shallow pans. The pastries tasted dry, as if they’d been cut open earlier and left out, and the coffee from the machine came out weak unless I ran a double shot. Twice they ran out of eggs and ham at peak time and took nearly fifteen minutes to replenish. For the price, I ended up grabbing a fresh croissant from the bakery on Avenue de la Motte-Picquet instead.",
        "source_3": "Only commenting on room cleanliness: in 212 I found long hairs in the shower drain and dust along the baseboards behind the curtains on arrival. The glass shelf over the sink had water spots and fingerprints, and the carpet showed old stains near the desk. Housekeeping did a second pass after I asked at noon, which helped with the bathroom, but the dust in the corners and the carpet marks stayed put.",
        "source_4": "Just about the front desk: we arrived late at 11 p.m. with one bag missing, and the night clerk waved us toward the phone and said to handle it directly with the airline. There was no offer to log the claim number or follow up, so we spent an hour on hold in the lobby. The morning shift was more proactive, but the initial handoff left us to manage the issue on our own when we were exhausted.",
        "source_5": "As an overall take, the location is handy but not quite as breezy as I expected with luggage in tow. The metro is technically close, yet the walk with two suitcases over uneven sidewalks felt longer than “two blocks,” and getting to the Eiffel Tower security gates from the hotel took closer to 12–15 minutes. Our room looked onto an interior courtyard with scaffolding during our stay, so there wasn’t much of a view. The room itself was compact, bed on the firmer side, and the elevator fits two people if no one has a large bag."
